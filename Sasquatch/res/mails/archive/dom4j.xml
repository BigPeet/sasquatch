    <header>[dom4j-dev] stack trace code in saxreader</header>
    <body>I'm new to the mailing list and not sure if this has been addressed, but in  v 1.35 of SaxReader, there is a printStackTrace() that is probably not appropriate... line # 308, the read(InputSource in). I had to comment this out to contain uncontrolled stack traces when plugging in Xerces for validation against a DTD.  The stack trace to system out should be left up to the user of the API, I would think. Great API otherwise.  Integrated XPath has been a big help.   Thanks.</body>

    <body>text() will attempt to do a recursive walk of the sub-tree, and assemble only the text portion.  text() applied to your &amp;lt;row&amp;gt; element should produce something like: 601133922 US Dollar 3 601133902 null Category Currently List text() applied to a &amp;lt;value&amp;gt; tag should get the text within it, but since you have a fairly flat hierarchy, getTextTrim() might also be a good solution for you, since you don't need the semantics of recursion. columnNode.getTextTrim() would produce 601133922 for the first Does that help at all? -bob On Mon, 29 Oct 2001, Doug Hoppes wrote:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] why insertBefore(Node newNode, Node refNode)   not supported in DefaultElement level?</header>
    <body>hi, I have a problem using dom4j to insert a new node into a specific position in the tree. This is because the insertBefore(Node newNode, Node refNode) is not defined in com.dom4j.Node interface, but only implemented in "org.dom4j.dom.DOMElement", which is derived from "org.dom4j.tree.DefaultElement". But the default implementation of dom4j seems to be creating DefaultElement instead of DOMElement. If you get an object from method like Element test = Element.clone()   or You can't cast test into DOMElement, because internally it is created as DefultElement. Therefore, you can't do a test.insertBefore(newNode, refNode) on test, because inserBefore() is only supported in DOMElement level. I have checked dom4j.Node interface and found insertBefore() is not defined there. I think insertBefore is a very important feature that has been define in DOM Node, so I think it should be included into the dom4j.Node interface. Anyone encounter similia problem and knows a way to round about this? thx, amber</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Using ElementHandlers and XPath predicates simultaneously.</header>
    <body>When using the ElementHandler feature of the SAXReader, there is only a subset of XPath available (eg no element predicates can be used). Is there any documentation on what can and can't be used? I think it would be useful if this feature was available via the SAXContentHandler also. In my application, I have a SAX event stream and want to build a Document without having to reparse it. I suppose it would be possible for me to write a dummy implementation of XMLReader which just passed my SAX event stream to the SAXReader directly. Thanks in advance, PJ Fanning</body>

So you'll soon be able to do more complex notifications based on XPaths such as a//b[@x='12]/c You mean you want to pass SAX events straight into SAXReader without reparsing it? Sounds a good idea to me. The SAXContentHandler implements the SAX interfaces, ContentHandler, LexicalHandler and so on, so you could just use that class explicitly. Do let us know if there's anything we can do to make SAXContentHandler easier to use stand-alone. James _________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

    <body>a you configurable Without access to a DTD you can't know what whitespace is significant thanks to 'mixed content' where tags are embedded inside text. thought You're understanding is correct. I was thinking of cases where a developer knew up front what kinds of documents they were parsing and so they themselves turned on whitespace-trimming mode, fully aware of the consequences. Any whitespace trimming technique should be used with extreme care. Though for data-centric applications, trimming whitespace could be really useful. e.g. If trimming of whitespace-only text nodes was enabled, the above would not have 3 extra Text nodes added. This could only be done safely if the DTD was like this though it could be enabled by hand if the developer understood what they were doing. great. It would be easy to turn on as a configurable option if you know that whitespace isn't important. Normally DTDs are used to make that call.

    <body>Hello again,  I've given the issue more thought, and instead of deprecating declaredNamespaces why don't we alter its behaviour (and javadoc) to simply return all its namespaces that are not in the list of namespaces for its parent element? For an element with no parent this would be all of them. This would be a nice convenience method which could be used by anyone wanting to generate output without worrying about namespaces. Generating namespace declarations for each namespace in the list of declaredNamespaces for every element would yield correct documents.  The only concern I can see is the expense in time and/or space required to determine what namespaces are in the parent's content but not in the element's.

Then the &amp;lt;foo:bar&amp;gt; element was detach()'ed from the document and added as the root element to a new document  with code something like this...  // parse first doc  // make second doc and output it   Then the output of second.xml will look like this...    Under the covers dom4j really just associates elements and attributes with QName objects which represent a local name and a Namespace. A Namespace object consists of just a prefix and a URI.  unnecessary namespace declarations are ignored.  So in many ways the declaredNamespaces() method can returns a worst-case list of the namespaces that *may* be declared, though some of those declarations might be filtered out if they are already declared by a parent element.  e.g.  if this document were round tripped in dom4j...   it would come out like this...   Since the second namespace declaration is unnecessary.  Does the above all make sense and seem reasonable to you?  If it does, then maybe we should deprecate the declaredNamespaces() method as its a bit misleading. An Element may have a Namespace and may have additional Namespaces but it depends on its parents as to whether it will output those declartions when streaming itself to text, SAX or DOM.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Using Velocity for XML transformations instead of XSL</header>
    <body>Hello, I'm new to dom4j list (made my first little XML-&amp;gt;Java Object mapping this weekend :-)) so I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction as to where the XML transformation code lies and how it's used. I would like allow the use of Velocity to transform XML documents in a general way. Right now the closest thing is something called Anakia but it operates on specifically named elements which isn't very useful outside it's very limited scope of creating the documentation for Jakarta. In velocity it is possible to define #macros : #macro (td $value) #end And these macros are available with Java using the Velocity application helper. So what I would like to be able to do is for each element that is come across execute the corresponding #macro if it exists. Any thoughts or ideas? -- jvz. Jason van Zyl</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Using Velocity for XML transformations instead of XSL</header>
    <body>Hi Jason Most of the XML transformation code relies on XSLT and JAXP. it's Using XPath expressions to access parts of a document might help? So this would be converted to if the macro definition was applied? How would $value be used - could it be used for an element name or content or attribute name or content? Mmm I'll have to think further about that. Are we allowed to use XSLT to help solve this? :-) James _________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

    <header>[dom4j-dev] new options to merge text nodes and strip whitespace nodes</header>
    <body>I've added 2 new options to SAXReader to allow more optimal parsing of data-centric XML documents. (i.e. documents where the performance of parsing is more important than the perfect preservation of whitespace). In particular the common kind of XML as follows would create 5 text nodes by default, only 1 of them contain "1234" the others all containing whitespace. The new 'stripWhitespaceText' will remove all completely whitespace text between sequential pairs of start/end tags. So the above would consist of 3 elements and 1 test node, as most people new to XML would expect. In addition the new 'mergeAdjacentText' will ensure that adjacent text nodes are concatenated into the same Text node Its documented more fully on the status page on the website. Both these 2 new options when applied to reasonably complex documents can lead to a 10% or so performance improvement, give or take 5% or so, depending on the nesting and structure of the document.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Extracting Information from XMLSchemas</header>
    <body>Hi Luis This sounds pretty close to the functionality of the org.dom4j.datatype library. Using this library you can parse an XML Schema document and create a Datatype-aware Document which performs data type validation. Yuxin Ruan has been working away to improve the XML Schema Datatypes support (thanks Yuxin!) so I think we're getting quite close to full XSD datatype support. There's a simple example in dom4j/src/samples/DatatypeDemo.java which demonstrates how to parse a document using the DatatypeDocumentFactory which will create data types from a schema. So java.lang.Number/Integer/Double, java.util.Calendar etc. are created for elements and attributes that are defined in the schema. The XML Schema document can be read explicitly via the loadSchema() method on DatatypeDocumentFactory or implicitly via the xsi:schemaLocation or xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation attributes. If you have a datatype aware document then the getData() method on an attribute or element will return the underlying Java data value object, such as a Number or Calendar. There are a whole bunch of JUnit tests in dom4j/src/test/org/dom4j/datatype/*.java which test out the datatype support; looking at those might help you understand the datatype support in dom4j. In addition there are 2 sample programs in the dom4j/src/samples/validate directory called MSVDemo and XercesDemo that might be helpful - they demonstrate how to perform XML Schema validation with dom4j using the MSV and Xerces libraries respectively. The MSV library looks very promising, it supports DTD, XML Schema, RelaxNG together with Relax and TREX. Does that help answer your question?

That doesn't work for me, since %CD% gets added without the '\'. so rather than c:\dom4j\lib\foo.jar I get c:\dom4jlib\foo.jar.

Although it is written in the ApiDocs there is only setNamespaceContext which is using JAXEN. I downloaded dom4j-1.0.zip from Southforge but there is no such function in the source code. How come?

    <header>[dom4j-dev] new Swing TableModel...</header>
    <body>I've just commited the code for a new Swing TableModel which allows XML information to be displayed in a Swing JTable easily. org.dom4j.swing.XMLTableModel. You can explicitly construct an XMLTableDefinition via java code (as demonstrated in samples/swing/JTableDemo.java) or an XML document can be used to define the table model itself. e.g. here's an example table model to display information from the periodic table in a Swing JTable. You can see examples of these in xml/swing. In addtion the use of XPath variables can be used to refer to other column values in a row, such as notice the use of $Name in the following table which displays the servlets available in a web.xml document... There is a sample program to display a JTable for a given table definition XML config file and a source XML documet at samples/swing/JTableTool.java The above is all available in CVS and the daily build. I hope any Swing developers out there might find this useful. James _________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Get your free @yahoo.com address at</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Newbie-question</header>
    <body>Certainly namespaces do complicate things a little. to get a handle on XPath you could try following some of the useful links on this page  If you wanted to find the ImageResolution of the 'Device' in MyDeviceProfile using XPath then you could do this String imageRes = document.valueOf( "/rdf:RDF/rdf:Description[@rdf:ID='MyDeviceProfile#]/rdf:component/rdf:Descr iption[@rdf:ID='Device']/prf:ImageResolution" Though its a fairly big XPath expression in RDF when using XPath and namespaces. By default dom4j will use the prefixes used in your document. Though strictly speacking you should specify the prefixes you wish to use in XPath yourself so that any prefix can be used in the source documents - prefixes are just syntax sugar - its the URIs that are the really important stuff. So in the current daily build you can do things like... // build a Map of namespace prefixes and URIs uris.put( "SOAP-ENV", " XPath xpath = document.createXPath( James Sent: Wednesday, December 12, 2001 4:04 PM Subject: [dom4j-dev] Newbie-question Hi there!

The Minifon, developed in the early 1950s by Monske GMBH of Hanover(or by Protona GMBH- I'm not certain), was an ultra-miniaturized, battery operated magnetic recording device. It could not (initially at least) record the full range of sounds and was thus limited to voice recording, but it did offer easy portability in a very small package. The idea of offering a pocket dictating machine was novel, since dictation had previously been done in the office. However, it was thought that people like salesmen could take the machine "on the road" with them. Once on the market, the Minifon's promoters discovered that many people took advantage of the recorder's small size to make secret recordings to be used as The "legitimate" use of the Minifon, as a dictating machine, was somewhat problematical. Recordings made on regular dictating equipment were usually letters, and thus were normally sent almost immediately to a typist. The Minifon offered no obvious advantages over standard dictation equipment for office use, but its developers hoped to cultivate new uses for dictation equipment, such as stock taking in warehouses, or the use of the machine as a substitute for note-taking by reporters, insurance adjusters, salesmen, and others. In its original form, the Minifon was a wire recorder, using a type of wire medium developed by the Armour Research Foundation of Chicago and employed in many similar devices since the late 1940s. The machine at its introduction in 1952 had a recording time of one hour, which was remarkably long, and weighed only about 3 pounds at a time when a typical office dictating machine weighed upwards of 10 pounds. It accomplished this small size and light weight in part through the use of miniature tubes and clever mechanical design. The basic machine cost $289.50-- a price that sounds high today but was very much in line with competing office dictating machines. The parent company attempted to set up distribution, sales and service networks in the United States. It established a business office called the Minifon Export Corp in New York, and an existing company, Harvey Radio in New York City became the main distributor. Although smaller tape recorders appeared at about the same time, the main competition in the voice recording field was from an American company, Mohawk, which made a small, battery-operated cartridge tape recorder called the Migetape. Both After a few years, the Minifon was modified to use transistors and magnetic tape, further lowering its weight and cost. By 1962 the basic machine weighed in at only 1.5 pounds. Competition by this time had helped bring the cost down to $249.50. The Minifon after about 1962 was distributed by the international conglomerate ITT through its subsidiary in the U.S., Federal Electric Corp. A little later, distribution was taken over by the ITT Distributor Products Division in Lodi, New Jersey. (I don't know whether these were the same company with different names) By the time ITT became associated with this product, it had taken on the name of Minifon "Attache," and a new line of models and options appeared. These included a hi-fi model, the 978H, which sold for $330.50.Usinga two-track, 1/4 inch tape cartridge operating at 1 7/8 inches per second, the machine claimed a frequency response of up to 12,000 Hz, plus or minus 3db. The coming of magnetic tape did not completely displace wire. The Model 240 series of recorders introduced in the early 1960s were probably the last wire recorders in regular production. The 240L, at a price of $269.50 used a special long-playing wire cartridge that held 4 hours of wire. Otherwise it looked like both the tape model and the 240S, which used a 2-hour wire cartridge and sold for $249.50. Another innovation was the introduction of more conventional recorders. After years of offering only "half" of a complete dictation system, Minifon finally developed a restyled, non-portable "office" machine, mainly for use by a transcriber, with pedal controls. By the mid-1960s, Minifon was trying to market its machines as multi-purpose devices suitable for nearly any recording need. In addition to the hi-fi and long-playing machines, the company offered an astounding variety of optional equipment such as foot controls, microphones, external amplifiers and loudspeakers, headsets, external power supplies, telephone recording attachments, conference recording adapters. One of the most interesting options were the miniature microphones intended to allow users to make "spy" recordings. In addition to a small tie-clip microphone, the Minifon could be equipped with a microphone disguised as a wrist- watch.</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Problem with UserData{Element,Attribute}</header>
    <body>Thanks for the reply. I'm trying to create new elements/attributes *after* the DOM has been "parsed in", so I'm traversing to the element and calling addAttribute(..args..). At this time the element no longer remembers that its document factory is the UserDataDocumentFactory without making the changes below.

    <body>That sounds like a bug. SAXReader should be using the document factory you set when it transforms the org.w3c.Nodes to org.dom4j.Nodes. What do you think James? Chuck Simpson Chuck_Simpson@... Hi Chuck : Yes I have done that. The documentFactory is however, not recorded in the UserDataElement that is created (in the DOM representation of the XML) So if you add an attribute to the DOM received from parsing (as you suggest below), that does not add a UserDataAttribute but a DefaultAttribute. I'm doing something like : the call marked &amp;lt;-- doesn't add a UserDataAttribute but a DefaultAttribute, assuming the attribute doesn't exist in the xmlfile.

    <body>Hi : I'm trying to use a Dom4J DOM adorned with User defined objects (UserDataElement) I tried to add an attribute to a UserDataElement (org.dom4j.util) after the DOM was created, and found that it added a "DefaultAttribute" rather than a "UserDataAttribute". Upon looking a bit at the source code, seems like the "getDocumentFactory() method that UserDataElement inherits from DefaultElement should be overriden so that it can provide it's own documentFactory. Can someone verify this is correct ? (Or do I have a version that is old ?) Thanks a lot Vivek</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Problem with default namespace (no prefix) and XPATH</header>
    <body>Hi Juergen I simply must add this to the FAQ, its one of those questions that keeps coming up. The answer is that you were on the right track with the setNamespaceURIs. Though in XPath expressions you must use a prefix. Note that the prefix is irrelevant and syntax sugar - what matters is the local name of the element and the namespace URI that its associated with. So using a prefix of whatever you like, say "foo" would work, even if the source document was using no prefix (or the default namespace as its often called). The prefixes do not need to match, only the URIs.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Easier namespace xpath handling</header>
    <body>Hey Chris Just a thought, what if DocumentFactory had a way of registering a NamespaceContext or a namespace URI Map with it, then you could register your normal namespaces once and never have to worry about such things again. e.g. if you were to register your preferred namespace URIs with the singleton DocumentFactory, then everthing should see it I think. I`m on the road the moment, having to use pesky internet cafes right now but once I get a real net connection on my laptop I will try experiment with this approach, it could make things *much* easier to use when using namespaces and XPath. BTW point 2) you mention - XPath cannot use namespaces with no prefixes. Or to say that another way, the only way to specify a namespace in an XPath expression is to use a prefix.

    <body>Hi Marc, :&amp;gt;37) Frist of all the stacktrace you submitted has nothing to do with dom4j. As I can see you use netbeans to start test your servlet. Netbeans is using a version of Tomcat 3.2 internally. If you use Apache JServer or Apache and Tomcat on your machine and  Netbeans both Webservers are trying to use the same port properly. Configure your Netbeans inbuild WebServer in order to avoid that problem. The code you posted actually parses an XML String using a XML Parser. This can be inbuild Aelfred or a JAXP compliant Parser in classpath. So it creates a completly new instance of org.dom4j.Document containing the parsed Text. Hope that helps.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Issue with default namespace declaration on element in other ns</header>
    <body>Hi, I seem to have a problem with a document where a default namespace is declared, but not used, on the root element. I am unable to find any trace of the declaration, and so is getNamespaceForPrefix(null) on elements in the document. Example document: ... I think the problem is in SaxContentHandler (see below), where namespaces are added to elements. If the prefix has size=0 it is not added to the list of declared namespaces. I think this works in other documents because the root element is almost always in the default namespace, if any. I would fix this myself (remove the requirement that length() &amp;gt; 0) but would appreciate input on whether this really is an issue first.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Re: [dom4j-user] XMLWriter bug !!?</header>
    <body>Hi Manfred I hope you don't mind, I CC'd the dom4j-dev list so this response gets archived... I guess thats the SAX parser splitting up text based on buffer boundaries. e.g. if it reads in chunks of 1K and a text block spans across the block boundary, then 2 SAX characters() methods will be fired which will result in 2 Text nodes. Incidentally this behaviour can be disabled by calling SAXReader.setMergeAdjacentTextNodes(true). So there is a bug in the current whitespace handling when adjacent text nodes are used - its always printing a space character which breaks your document. Yes. This is the SAX parser splitting up a piece of text into seperate characters() callbacks which result in seperate Text nodes unless the "mergeAdjacentTextNodes" property is enabled. I have added a test case, testWhitespaceBug2(), to the JUnit test suite org.dom4j.TestXMLWriter which tests your use case (and indeed was broken). I've now fixed it. Essentially the trick is that when whitespace trimming is enabled, all consecutive Text nodes are concatenated before the text gets StringTokenized. The code is a little longer than I would like but its all in the writeElementContent() method in XMLWriter if you're interested in taking a peek. Its all in CVS right now - hopefully we can get the daily build working again soon. Thanks for spotting this issue Manfred! Hopefully its now fixed.

    <body>How do I convert a org.w3c.dom.Document to a org.dom4j.Document? Perhaps the DocumentFactory and DocumentHelper classes should contain a method such as the following... public static org.dom4j.Document ...which would imply that implementations of org.dom4j.Document would have a constructor that accepts a org.w3c.dom.Document. In any case, if I am using another parser (such as JTidy) that returns a W3C Document, and then wish to initialize a DOM4J Document with the returned document, how do I do so? I only found methods to do DOM4J -&amp;gt; W3C conversions, contained in the DOMNodeHelper class. Thanks! ===== -- spamcut@... __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Problem with UserData{Element,Attribute}</header>
    <body>Hi Vivek I've investigated this issue quite a bit. I've tried to reproduce your problem in the test case in src/test/org/dom4j/TestUserData in particular cases testNewAddtions() and testNewDocument() In both cases, without patching the code, I always get UserDataElement and UserDataAttributes being created. So I don't think a patch is needed (more on this later). I'd appreciate seeing the code you use to create the new Attributes to try reproduce the problem. Even better, if you could submit a patch to the TestUserData JUnit test case that actually fails, then we'll be able to fix it pretty quick. The (slightly complex) reason I think this is all working fine is that when adding new nodes to an existing Branch (Document or Element) then it uses its own getDocumentFactory() method. So So foo's internal getDocumentFactory() will be used to create the new nodes. A Document has its own  DocumentFactory property it uses that can be changed explicitly via setDocumentFactory(). Element objects by default will use the DocumentFactory associated with their QNames if one is available or use the singleton. This allows different DocumentFactory objects to be used for different named elements. e.g. It may be that we want to use UserDataDocumentFactory for &amp;lt;pizza&amp;gt; elements but use the CheeseDocumentFactory for &amp;lt;cheese&amp;gt; elements. So if you create a Document from a custom DocumentFactory, then all nodes added to it will use the new factory, provided that the DocumentFactory associates itself with each QName it creates. This is what UserDataDocumentFactory actually does. So the following... (extracting some code from the TestUserData test case) Will make UserDataElement and UserDataAttribute objects. Does that help clear this up? James _________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Get your free @yahoo.com address at</body>

    <body>Hi Laramie I'm CC'ing the dom4j-dev list to see if others have any ideas.  You raise an interesting problem that I'd not considered before. Maybe the XMLWriter and HTMLWriter could be refactored a bit so that the trimming mode is enabled/disabled based on which element its inside. e.g. the OutputFormat could get its trimtext mode swizzled based on the element name, so that pre, script, style tags always come out without trimtext.

    <body>This feature allows different named Element/Attributes to have different factories. e.g. JAXM uses this feature to create different Element implementations for a SOAP Envelope, Header and Body. Similarly the datatypes support uses this feature to create type-aware (int, date, float etc) Element and Attributes based on the 'type' in the schema.

    <header>RE: [dom4j-dev] generating a QName</header>
    <body>I think the algorithm is not quite right How about this for attribute and branch if the QName has a DocumentFactory then the getDocument() method on branch/Attribute should return it, if the element has a parent then return the parents' documentFactory otherwise return the defaultDocumentFactory() (a new factory method, returning by default the DefaultDocumentFatory) the default for Node should be the same without the Qname bit There should be some documentation in setQName and Qname.setDocumentFactory to indicate the potential issues this will allow for the documentfactory to be defined at any level in the document hierarchy and defaulted by subclasses which I think is more correct in this usage that we are discussing, ie the child elements should be appropriate to their parent, or the nearest parent that defines it When looking at the code (1.3) I note that the implementation of the current getDocumentFActory in AbstractElement (to be replaced with the algorithm above) is I think misplaced and should be in AbstractBranch, and in AbstractAttribute.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] generating a QName</header>
    <body>Using the element's or attribute's QName to track the DocumentFactory implementation gives fast lookup with little added overhead. Right now the DocumentFactory connection is kind of operating behind the scenes, though. To make it work cleanly you'd need added methods to specify the DocumentFactory for the get() QName calls, and also need to include the DocumentFactory in the QName cache comparison (so that the same QName could be defined with different DocumentFactories). If no DocumentFactory were specified you could just set the default factory when you construct a new QName. - Dennis James Strachan wrote:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] JSR query</header>
    <body>Hi, As per the comparisons shown between various XML Object Models on your site it appears that dom4j is the best available. If this is the case why is dom4j not being pushed in the JCP as a jsr instead of jdom. What the java community needs is the best XML Object model as the standard one so that all developers can make use of it. Why are you not trying to get dom4j into the jcp process especially considering there is already a stable release out for dom4j and not so for jdom. I have nothing much for or against either. I would just like to see the jcp adopt a fair process of picking the best possible object model for adopting it into the standard java tree. That was my 2 cents worth.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] JSR query</header>
    <body>site Good question. The JDOM JSR is essentially an attempt to use the JCP process to manage the already existing JDOM open source project. So its not really an attempt to put together a standard API for working with XML on the Java platform per se - its just a 'process' for the JDOM project to manage itself. e.g. noone from the DOM, dom4j or EXML worlds gets a voice on the JDOM JSR - its just for the JDOM people &amp;amp; project only, so its not a 'Java platform standard' like JAXP or JSP which take a cross section of experts from the industry. jcp adopting I totally agree. Though I'm not sure if this will happen. There's already 4 APIs, DOM, dom4j, religous reasons) to unite under a common, standard API. It would be nice though! For example the JAXM API could derive from it if there was a standard, interface based API. James</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] BackedList::add()</header>
    <body>Hi there, The Element::elements() methods return a List interface which is implemented as a BackedList. When we sought to use the List::add() method as follows: where root currently already contains 5 elements. We were getting an IndexOutOfBoundsException which reported itself with index=5, size=5 which doesn't match the conditions specified in the List interface JavaDoc: IndexOutOfBoundsException - if the index is out of range (index &amp;lt; 0 || index &amp;gt; size()). Looking into BackedList::add() it becomes obvious that the exception was actually being thrown by the List::get() method in which case, the exception makes perfect sense. I'd like to propose the following change to the add method to make BackedList::add() behave like List::add() - if there are reasons not to do this, then that's fine as well - but perhaps it should be a note somewhere - I didn't notice anything like that in the Cookbook (but I didn't do an exhaustive search). public void add(int index, Object object) Regards, Andy ______________________________________________________________________ Find, Connect, Date!</body>

    <header>RE: [dom4j-dev] generating a QName</header>
    <body>Hi Dennis, From what I understand of the code the Qname lives in a QnameCache which is (generally) owned by the DocumentFactory, The QnameCache in Qname is not used except where by the dom4j code just by the programmer who want more fine grained control (I don't know if there is any real use for it), so I don't think that the comparison is required. I believe that all of the Qnames that exists in the QnameCache cache should have the DocuemntFactory This could easily be done if we can make a structural change to the code, so that a Qname is an inner class of the QnameCacheand even make QNAmeChahe an inner class of DocumentFacory, so that the documentFactory would be intimately and immutably associated with the DocumentFactory. Would this cause any problems with the current code base? (Probably) Alternativly we could allow for the DocumentFactory to be set only once and throw an IIllegalSTateException if it is modified and exists in it parent documentFatory Qname cache. This will allow for any users of the Qname class directly to be unaffected be the change Or we could change Qname to be a base class/interface and have inner class and other implementations, but the are code implications here as well (&amp;lt;aside&amp;gt; it is a shame that java did not allow for the instantiation of an interface by having a default implementation ...&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;) Any thoughts /flames ?

Right now the DocumentFactory connection is kind of operating behind the scenes, though. To make it work cleanly you'd need added methods to specify the DocumentFactory for the get() QName calls, and also need to include the DocumentFactory in the QName cache comparison (so that the same QName could be defined with different DocumentFactories).

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] generating a QName</header>
    <body>I still want to mull this over a little bit more though I think I'm getting a closer idea. One of the problems is that setting the DocumentFactory to use on a given node is kind of a multi-dimensional problem - there are various different use cases. Sometimes folks want to specify a factory for use of a specific named element or attribute, such as in schema-based work or SOAP et al. Using a DocumentFactory on a QName works nicely for this, provided developers get their QNames from a single place (either via the singleton QName.get() methods or via the DocumentFactory.createQName() instance). Sometimes folks want to specify a DocumentFactory on a per-document (or across document) instance. e.g. to attach user data to elements, or implement some different kinda model (persistent model, non-lazy, thread-aware or whatnot). In a similar way certain element implementations might be hard-wired to some factory so that any content added to them will be of a certain kind. (e.g. for persistent elements). The current (admitedly non-public) implementation allows the above; either a factory can be associated with a document, a specific element implementaiton or a qname. So simply making getDocumentFactory() public on the Node interface would fix things I think. Where this might get a bit wierd is if we use the 'if I can't find a factory, use my parents' algorithm that Mike suggested. At first thought this sounds right (and I've been down this road too). It turns out that I think this algorithm might confuse things and break some of the above use cases. e.g. I might want to use a certain 'default' factory for an entire document, apart from all XInclude elements for which I want to use a special factory that implements the XInclude. Using the 'parent' algorithm, this would kinda break as children of XInclude would not use the 'default' factory that it should. So I think I like the algorithm thats effectively... * if the Node has been assigned its own factory use it else * if the QName has a factory use it else * else use the document's factory * else use the singleton's factory I guess we could always have a special element implementation which will use its parents factory instead of its document's factory if folks need it but I think the default case should probably be to use the document (not parent)'s factory. The downside of this could lead (with the current implementation) to excessive navigation up the tree. BTW setting the document factory on a document is used when parsing via, say, SAXReader with a custom factory - the custom factory is then associated with the new document so further modifications via code will use the same factory. So preseving the setDocumentFactory() on a Document is a good thing I think, though not on other nodes.

    <body>HI James, I'm not sure that I understand the problem that you are describing related to the Xincludes Are you talking about a specific implementation of Element, or some Xpath description. If you mean the former then this can be handled by the overriding the methods Are you concerned about the difference between the documentFactory of the element, and the document factory of the node to be created below it, if so that this is an issue for the document factory itself I feel that I am missing the point soo please can you explain the issue more fully. Regarding the setDocumentFactory method that I was talking about, I was referin to the method in the Qname class dot he document class.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] generating a QName</header>
    <body>I was taking XIncludes to be an example of a specific qualified name of Element that we may want to treat differently, using its own factory. i.e. we want to process a certain 'type' of element with a certain factory, but process its children in the same way as its parents. If an Element were to always delegate to its parent to get the factory, this kinda thing would break. Another example could be validation. Imagine if we attach some validation rule to an Element (like in the data type stuff) via a factory. So for element contains other elements, it doesn't mean we want to force all children of &amp;lt;order&amp;gt; to use the order's factory. For any schema-based models I think defaulting to the document's factory is cleaner than defaulting to the parents element. so more that Yes this is a concern. Though the ability to customize the factory on a per QName basis is very powerful, e.g. schema or datatype aware processing or SOAP handling, JAXM etc. Though you're right, this immutability could cause problems, though I'm not sure how to get around it.

    <body>Maybe I did not make clear the solution I used. It IS possible to parse an XML stream coming from a socket WITHOUT knowing its length. What you need to do (I can post the code if you wish) is understanding the logical end of the XML stream (the logical end is whan you go back to level Zero of the XML tree). To do this you need to use a SAXDriver and use a custom ContentHandler class. It works.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] XML java server - reading + writing XML to   socket</header>
    <body>Hi Damiano, The approach you're taking is going to be a hit or miss kind of thing, depending on the parser and the way your data is coming across the socket connection. If you're sending multiple XML documents across the connection there's a good chance the parser will read beyond the "end" of the current document and on into the next one because of buffering, which will cause that data to be missing when you try to read the next document. If you're only sending one at a time (and then waiting for a response before sending the next) the parser may block before the end of the document because it doesn't have a full buffer or data. A more general solution is to wrap the socket with a special Reader that (for instance) looks for the XML declaration "&amp;lt;?xml ...". This is optional, but if you know it's always going to be present (and that it won't be embedded in documents using CDATA sections) you can look for that pattern in the text and deliver a logical end of input at that point (until it's time to parse the next document). Is that clear? Your multi-document Reader would wrap a normal Reader as input. It would provide the usual Reader calls for the parser, along with an additional control method - "advanceDocument()", perhaps. When the parser calls the "close()" method you just ignore it (or set a logical close flag that's cleared by the advanceDocument() call). You would not supply any more data on read() calls past the start of the XML declaration until after advanceDocument() was called, though. Hope that helps. I haven't got time to provide more details now, but I'm sure somebody has implemented this before and you can probably find it with a search. - Dennis Ing. Damiano Bolla wrote:</body>

    <body>Not without making some assumptions about what the XML looks like. tree). class. Oh you mean to hack it to ignore everything after the last endElement() event then force the parser to abort by throwing a SAXException? It kinda works but its cheating really, since there may be comments and processing instructions that you might be hiding; this also may make the next document invalid. e.g. If you stopped parsing as soon as you hit the &amp;lt;/foo&amp;gt; tag then the comment at the end of the document will appear at the start of the next document, which is invalid as the &amp;lt;?xml ?&amp;gt; declaration has to the first.

    <body>I found and fixed a simple bug in XMLWriter.java.  A fixed version is attached, but not checked into the source repository.  I'll leave that for the folks who maintain the sources. If you parse and print out (using asXML) an XML document containing a numeric entity reference such as &amp;amp;#160; (the code for &amp;amp;nbsp;) the code was just writing out a byte with a value of 160 (decimal).  The fix (abstracted below) is to check for characters with integer codes below 32 and above 126 (excluding standard whitespace characters) and encode them as numeric entities.

    <body>Hi Terry, The problem I fixed really just has to do with proper handling of characters outside the normal XML character set, which is roughly 7-bit ascii.  The $#150; character is outside that set, so my fix would get the asXML method to produce the right thing. On the other hand, what you see when you render a String containing "funny" characters depends on many other things that have nothing to do with the XML.  In particular, if you try to display a character using a font that has no glyph for the character code, it may well be displayed as a "?" instead of as what you intend.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Compliments and simple patch</header>
    <body>Dear Developers First of all compliments to everybody ! I would like to share with all of you my experience and a small patch I come up with. Congratulation. dom4j is the parser that comes with a pattern matching method to select nodes ! Lets assume we want to do the following. --- Build a java server that accepts XML from a socket and writes an XML answer on the very same socket. There are three problems in doing this 1) The SAXReader and other means of readin XML will not detech the logical end of an XML stream 2) Using Oracle parsers you have some weird buffering problems. 4) Some parsers will close the input stream at parsing done... To solve the problem you need the following 1) Use  SAXDriver(); and a custom ContentHandler that builds the document from events. 2) in the ContentHandlerT detect the startElement and endElement, use them to understand what you are back at level zero of the XML tree. 3) In addition to the above use characters to biuld a dov4j DOM tree out of the events. The ONLY problem remaining is that org.dom4j.io.aelfred.XmlParser does close the socket whan document parsing is done. Clearly this is BAD :-) so, I just commented out the closing of input streams in the doParse function. It would be nice if there where an option not to close the stream on document parsing termination Damiano Damiano Bolla, Director R&amp;amp;D, Infotech S.r.l</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] DatatypeDocumentFactory and xsi:type?</header>
    <body>Hello, I am experimenting with the DatatypeDocumentFactory and its schema support and noticed the following limitation: lack of support for the xsi:type attribute on document instances. For example, it would be nice to be able to specify in an xml document something like: Then, in dom4j be able to select the &amp;lt;intvalue&amp;gt; Node using the DatatypeDocumentFactory and call its getData() method. At first glance I thought it would be easy to handle this by subclassing the DatatypeDocumentFactory, but it appears that elements are constructed solely on there QName and not on any document instance type information. This is also a problem if your schema declares an element to be abstract and the document instance must choose the appropriate concrete type; e.g. I am rather new to dom4j so perhaps I missed something obvious in using the DatatypeDocumentFactory. P.S. At first glance it seems odd that QName is not an immutable object. Calling setDocumentFactory on a QName feels wrong to me. But again, this is coming from someone completely new to working with dom4j! Cheers, --mike</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] DatatypeDocumentFactory and xsi:type?</header>
    <body>Hi Mike No you've got it pretty much spot on. The DatatypeDocumentFactory was started to parse 'traditional' schemas where all the type information is in the schema, rather than in the document instance. However supporting elements with xsi:type attributes seems to make a whole lot of sense. It shouldn't be too hard to do if anyone fancies having a go at a patch? Agreed. This has come up before; I think ultimately we should probably make QName an immutable object and have a neat way to register a new QName with a specific DocumentFactory when doing schema-based specialization of the Node implementations.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] xpath-based node creation</header>
    <body>Hello, I don't know if you guys remember or not, but a while back I was looking into making a "mutable navigator" interface that could be used in order to write code that was independent of object model. I've finally got around to working on this, with a fair degree of success so far I think, but I'm stuck with at least one problem that I would like to ask about. This is, is there any existing library (or even just an accepted algorithm) documented somewhere, that allows nodes to be created based on an xpath? Here is one example. If I have the following document: Then, I would like for this following xpath: (with 'p' mapped to "urn:myPropsSchema") /p:properties/p:project[@name='bravo']/p:frame[@id='001']/@bounds to add and return the new node (the bounds attribute) like this: returned So far I've got what I *think* is a reasonable (though likely not optimal) algorithm that repeatedly pulls off the last component (using '/' as a delimiter of course) and repeats the evaluation, until it finds at least one matching node. So in this case, it would be: try 1:    /p:properties/p:project[@name='bravo']/p:frame[@id='001']/@bounds - nope try 2:    /p:properties/p:project[@name='bravo']/p:frame[@id='001'] - nope try 3:    /p:properties/p:project[@name='bravo'] - yep! Found a hit on try 3. Then I take the remainder (in this case p:frame[@id='001']/@bounds) and begin adding the nodes relative to the match we found, additionally adding any qualification as necessary along the way (for example, we add the id attribute with a value of '001' to the frame element that we add to the bravo project). So. My question is: is this a decent algorithm? I'm not quite as concerned about performance as I am about robustness across the range of potential xpaths that could be encountered. The primary use at this point is targeted towards generating a reasonably small number of requests from a graphical application - in the order of perhaps dozens at a time - not hundreds or thousands in a transform server or anything (at least not yet! :). The question is how to reasonably handle all of the weird and ambiguous cases that can be described in an xpath? For example, //*[@name='Jim'] - what the heck do you do with that? Anyway thanks for any advice, or pointers to existing implementations of this kind of functionality. Jim -- jim@... Visit</body>

    <body>Hello Jim, I think the algorithm is a decent one. But there is a lot of issues with=20 using XPath to guide modification of documents. You have to cope with non-uniqueness.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] xpath-based node creation</header>
    <body>I agree with you both. Though there's nothing to stop you taking a strict subset of XPath and just supporting that. e.g. you could parse the XPath using Jaxen, then walk Jaxen's Expr object model and deduce only those paths which are valid and handle those. It does seem kinda popular, to want to use XPath-like expressions to define documents and use lazy-contruction to 'fill in the blanks'.

    <body>i've done some initial work on this and it seems pretty easy to do, actually. i patched SAXContentHandler to store the Locator instance if it gets one and to store the position information when it creates new elements. strictly proof of concept, of course, i want to do it eventually for all nodes, but there you have it. my questions are: 1. is this something that the dom4j developers would be interested in having in the main source tree? 2. if so, can someone suggest the least intrusive way to introduce this into the code? my naive idea was to add get/set position methods to the Node and Element apis (elements have more position data than other nodes of course), add instance variables to actually store that data in AbstractNode and AbstractElement, and if SAXContentHandler gets a Locator, set the position data. one could argue, however, that that would be a waste of memory for dom4j users that don't care about position information... thanks. - donald -----Forwarded Message----- Subject: Re: [dom4j-user] given a Node, can i get its original position information?

    <body>Hi Markus, The problem is that you have not produced the proxy for the element, so at the moment the child of the element is the proxy, whose data is managed by the proxied defaultAttribute assuming that you are producing a proxy for the dfeaultElement etc when you implement the ProxyElement, then I presume that the children will be managed by the defaultElement but proxyAttribute.getParent() will deligate the parent call to the deafultAttribute which will return the default element in the proxied class  similarly the child relationship from the element will be deligated to return the child from the proxied element The test works OK because there is do graph of proxied nodes accessed by a graph of proxy nodes, just leaf node attributes, which only contain the value and parent  I hope that makes sence!  ### another JDOM convertee!

Look's quite ok to me. #################### Found my Design Pattern book yesterday. You are right, my classes are proxies and no facades. I will rename everything. #################### What I am trying to do with that ? Well, we have developed our first software production environment written in java 4 years ago. (Btw, the first in COBOL 1972) One part of it is a generic, meta-data driven thin AND fat java-client. It's thin, because it has no business-logic, no icon, no texts or anything project specific in it. It's fat, because after the start of the client it loads the meta-data with all th logic etc in it and it need a big amount of ram and cpu. Mainly we are mainframe guys and cpu-seconds there are expensive, so we put as much logic as possible into the client. At the moment we have round about 1.100 dialog-programs installed at the mainframe, all using the same java-client (and java-server). Over the years we found several shortcomings of our client and it has become more and more complicated to fix things. Our main problem arises from the Swing DataModels. I like MVC, but having thousands of DataModels over your code is not a good thing and writing a central specialized DataModel is an incredible amount of work (and really a pain in the ...). We started redesigning our client 1 1/2 year ago and I decided to put all data into a central structure, one XML-tree. The DataModels now are views at nodes of the tree, that's why I need events. At this time I used jdom beta 5/6. I have written all the event stuff and our prototype really, really rocked. And then ... I ran out of time. We had to stop the prototype for doing some projects. At the moment I'm reviving it again. Because I have some problems with the design of jdom and especially with some of the persons there I switched to dom4j (and because they refused to think about a event system until jdom 1.1. ROFL). What you are doing at your day-work sound really interessting to me, especially the rule and transaction thing. Do you have a flyer or a demo of it ?

    <header>[dom4j-dev] RFC Java-style event system for dom4j</header>
    <body>Hi everybody, after thinking some weeks about how to enable Java-style change events within dom4j I got yesterday some free hours to implement some classes. I would like to invite you to have a look at the code and to comment, what you think is good and what's bad. At the moment only Attributes are working. As code base I used the dom4j-daily.tar.gz from yesterday. Simply unzip the attached zip-file and do a build. Should compile without problems. Some details: - Facades, not inheritance: The event handling is implemented in facade classes. That means, that if you want use event handling at the creation of any node always a second facade object has to be instantiated. The main advantage is, that no existing interface or code has to be changed and every class implementing the org.dom4j interfaces can be event enabled. Simply use the EventDocumentFactory. - VetoChange: There's the possibility for listeners to veto a change. If you use events (and listeners which do veto), be prepared to catch the VetoChangeException. - Coding conventions: I tried to use your coding standards. If someone is not happy with anything please comment. - CVS_ID: I like to have in all of my interfaces and classes a constant CVS_ID with the actual version, etc. from cvs. If you don't like it I can remove this, but personally I would preferr to put this into all existing classes, because its so cheap (only some bytes per class-file), has no impact on performace at all, and is in debugging and logging that useful. - Visit event: At the first stage I only implement change events. Afterwards I like to do visit events. Why that's useful ? An example: You use a dom4j tree as data model for a javax.swing.JTable. Lets say you have 100.000 rows in it and the tree comes serialized via RMI from a remote server over a modem connection. Because of the serialization you have to wait till the whole tree is transmitted before you can read the first row (100.000 rows, 100 byte per row, 10MB, ISDN line 8kB/s, ca. 20 minutes), and the badest thing is that most of the data won't ever be read by the user. There are several solutions, but the most elegant would be the following. You divide the rows into chunks, lets say 50 or 100 rows. With the first request the server sends only the first chunk. Register a visit listener at the right place. This listener checks in the readout of any data, whether it's already loaded, if not it pulls the data from the server. In general: Visit events are useful if it's expensive to compute data and propably most of the data is not needed. Any comments are welcome -markus</body>

See the doco here: there is code in there specifically to deal with comments inside script tags, and preformatted sections.  There is also stuff for adding other tags to the list of things that are considered preformatted.  For that you would use HTMLWriter.setPreformattedTags(...).

    <body>Hi James, Just wanted to let you know that I've checked in a fix to the issue with default namespace redeclaration, as well as a test case that verifies the fix. Basically, if you took the document: and serialized it using XMLWriter it would drop the xmlns="" on &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Should I update the status.xml document?

    <header>RE: [dom4j-dev] XMLWriter bug with blank default namespace?</header>
    <body>Turned out to be fairly easy to fix in XMLWriter.java. James, can I ask you to apply the fix in the cvs? I'm not currently set up correctly with SSH and cvs at my current workstation. Proposed solution (patches to XMLWriter.java): First allow xmlns='' to be output by changing isNamespaceDeclaration() to: Then add: to all constructors of XMLWriter. This will make explicit the fact that NO_NAMESPACE is the default if no other namespace has been declared. This is necessary because otherwise xmlns="" is added to the root element of _all_ documents with no other namespace declarations, and this seems to be the most elegant solution.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] RE: Thread Safety</header>
    <body>In the simple case where multiple threads are building separate documents simultaneously you only need to change the static data structures: QNameCache and NamespaceCache that I know of. Using non-threadsafe code for these static data structures is a true bug in the current dom4j implementation, and should be fixed. If you actually want to support multiple threads accessing a writable document (even if only one is doing the writing) the problems go far beyond HashMap. You'd need to synchronize *all* calls (including read-only access calls to elements and such, since another thread could be modifying the data at the same time as your reader is accessing it). In order to avoid deadlock problems you'd probably want to use the document root object for all the synchronizations. The cleanest way of implementing this is by doing it in your own code, wrapping the dom4j calls with a synchronize on the document object. - Dennis David Hooker wrote:</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] RE: Thread Safety</header>
    <body>Actually, on looking at this in more detail it looks like the NamespaceCache already handles the multiple threads with separate documents case properly, with synchronized methods. QNameCache just needs the same type of change.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] (Maybe) Bug found in elementIterator()...</header>
    <body>I've fixed this temporarily in CVS by throwing an UnsupportedOperationException when the remove() operation is called on the Iterator returned by the Element.elementIterator(...) methods. This Iterator was an instance of FilterIterator (which uses another Iterator and filters away unwanted elements). I did this because I didn't find a way to easily solve the problem. I also believe it's better to not support the (optional) remove() operation than to provide a buggy implementation. Remark that this doesn't violate the Iterator specification because the remove() operation is optional and doesn't have to be supported by implementations. For what it's wort: the Jakarta Collections API also provides a FilterIterator which has the same purpose and there the remove() operation isn't supported neither.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] incompatible DefaultElement error</header>
    <body>This can occur when you are streaming objects from a client to a server (or to a file and then reading them in again) or in reverse.  This can be due to a mismatch in versions of dom4j or dependancies like different xerces or jaxen versions. When the javac compiles java to bytecode (.class) it gives each class a unique ID that is used during serialization.   What you are seeing is a mismatch.  So there is something different in you classpath between when the stream was sent and when the stream was received. If you have code that performs it's own Serializable reads and writes, there may be order changes that has left the stream out of sync. Hope that helps.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] fix for writing numeric entities in XMLWriter</header>
    <body>Finally I think I've fixed the character escaping issue once and for all. The default behaviour is for characters &amp;gt; 32 that are not special XML characters (&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;, &amp;amp; etc) are not escaped, unlessy you are outputting the XML using US-ASCII encoding. If you want to customize the behaviour of whether characters get escaped or not you can derive from XMLWriter and overload the method which by default uses the property getMaximumAllowedCharacter(), which auto-defaults itself to 127 if the output encoding is US-ASCII otherwise it defaults to -1 for no-encoding. So if you wanted to encode all characters over 255 you could do If anyone wants to try out this build before the 1.4 release goes out, please try out CVS or you can download a prebuilt dom4j JAR from here...  with version dom4j-1.4-dev-8.jar. If you're using Maven to build your project you can just change your dependency version number to 1.4-dev-8 and you should get the new version.

    <body>Hi there, *g* before this seems too negative... ;-)  Dom4j is GREAT... ;-) I seem to have a problem with dom4j-1.3; I'm generating an XML document from within a javacc-Parser. That part works nicely. But I noticed, that *sometimes* (rarely, though), some of the literals, that the parser puts into XML attributes can contain a 0-byte. When dom4j writes this to a file, and later tries to read that file, I'm getting at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(SAXReader.java:339) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(SAXReader.java:256) at org.dom4j.DocumentHelper.parseText(DocumentHelper.java:215) at org.yinyap.frame.JMSReceiver.next(JMSReceiver.java:125) ... 2 more (the only special character in there is a \0 byte right in an attribute value) The xml had been written using a normal dom4j XMLWriter, without any special options... Shouldn't dom4j escape the \0-bytes?  (or did I just forget the neccessary options to the XMLWriter to make it do so?) The fact, that dom4j writes xml-Files, that it can't read back itself, doesn't look all that smart, does it? Benedikt BEAUTY, n.

    <body>How does the \0 get into the String in the first place? This is an invalid XML String which preferably you should filter out before adding it to dom4j. Sure dom4j could check every character of every String that gets added to a document, though it'd add considerable overhead - so I'd prefer this to stay inside your application for now. Maybe you could make a simple helper method that could filter out any invalid characters from your element and attribute values?

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Bug when adding attributes using Qualified Name. Please help !</header>
    <body>Hi ! Here is my xml file: --------------------------- --------------------------- In my code, the variable "headElement" (of type org.dom4j.Element) points to the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; element of my xml file. if I do "headElement.declaredNamespaces();", I get a list that contains one org.dom4j.Namespace, and this is the one declared in the &amp;lt;smil&amp;gt; element of my xml document. (With prefix=="" and uri==" Now, I want to add the "xml:lang" attribute to headElement. I first create a QName: Namespace myNamespace = new Namespace("xml", " This works fine as the attribute is properly added. My problem is when using XMLWriter to serialize the document. I get: --------------------------- --------------------------- In fact there are 2 problems: - The first one seems to be a bug: it writes "xmlns:xm" instead of "xmlns:xml" - The second is that I don't want xmlns:xm=" to be written out at all, as xml is a default namespace prefix that should never be declared in an xml document (a validating parser will generate an error) Is there any way to prevent dom4j for creating a namespace attribute as soon as I add an attribute with a namespace that is not already declared in the document ? And another very last question: the xmlns attribute of my &amp;lt;smil&amp;gt; element doesn't appear as an attribute in the dom4j tree, but as a child (the first one) of the &amp;lt;smil&amp;gt; element, with the "org.dom4j.Namespace" type. Is it standard amongst dom-like xml libraries ? (using specific child nodes instead of "normal" attributes) Thank you very much for your replies ! Cheers, Daniel</body>

    <header>RE: [dom4j-dev] hashCode and equals for nodes</header>
    <body>Hi Bob, That may be true for the general case, but it is not true for a flyweight pattern. Flyweight are for reuse, and this equals should be content based.=20 The flyweight patern should have equals and hashCode, as that is the logical method of implementing re-use of the nodes. Unfortunatly, and inaccurately, the Flyweight* is a base class for the default* implementation.  =20 As a DefaultElement is not a FlyWeightAttribute, so I think that the inheritance tree is being abused for development ease, rather than reflecting OO concepts FYI This issue is related to the 'huge dom' thread.

    <body>Hi jason, I am looking at using content handlers and/or document factories modifications to allow for the re-use of some of the nodes. I have run some tests on some large doms that I have, and have spotted a reduction of 50% - 95% on the size of the dom. The restrictions are that the dom is read only, which is not a problem for you I believe, and that the flyweight pattern is used. Once I have a version that I am happy with I cn send you some code to try on your XML file. I will be looking to contribute this code once it has stablised, and I have removed the few minor propritory classes Mike</body>

    <body>Hi, I would use the Flyweight if it was not broken - see the thread on equals and hashCode, so I have subclassed from that. The values are part of the node, and the intering process looks at nodes which are identical. I have just about finished the code,=20 Docuent factories which co-ordinates the interning of the the leaf nodes The element classes are written, and are constructed by the Element handler, which coordinates the interning of the attribute lists and the content list, and the elemnt itself. There are a number of support classes for the custom lists (to reduce size), and a basic interner I have a couple of bugs to track down this morning, and I have finished seperating the code from my commercial dependencies, so I should ship you a demo jar this pm.=20 I will run some tests on that 800Mb XML file you refered to so that I can get some stats I havent checked that the tree is any good for use yet!

    <header>[dom4j-dev] XPATH enhancement</header>
    <body>I need to make some enhancements for my own purposes to the XPath functionality in dom4j.  I understand that this functionality comes from Jaxen but I'm trying to figure out where to start right now. When node.selectSingleNode("some/xpath") or another XPath call is made, I need to cross reference the element or attribute being selected back to a schema, dtd, or proprietary structure to make sure it was actually defined.  So if someone's XPath asks for an element or element path that is undefined in the schema, I will throw an exception. Likely, I need to extend some classes here but I'm not 100% sure where to start.   I'd also be willing to take a less-integrated approach if I could somehow get a parsed XPath string that would normalize down to just elements/attributes (no select criteria)... like converting "/favorites/color[name='blue']@rgbValue" to "/favorites/color/@rgbValue" where I can then easily tokenize it and compare it against the schema. I suppose this could be done manually but I'm guessing there are more XPath constructs I'd need to be able to parse which I am not aware of. I don't need any help with comparing it to the schema or DTD- I have that under control. Thanks for your insight.  If by the slim chance any of this ends up being useful to someone else, I'd be happy to contribute it back. Brian</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] jaxen: XPath context node bug?</header>
    <body>I've been looking at this issue for a few days and I have become reasonably convinced that this is a bug in Jaxen dealing with the context node when the context node is neither the Document nor the root element in the document -- or, perhaps, when the context node was returned by a previous XPath expression. The problem is that XPath fails to match on the context node under these circumstances.  I've written a program that demonstrates the behavior using nothing but dom4j (dom4j-patched-1.3). The program has two version of the same XML document built into it: 'theXML1' and 'theXML2'.  The only difference between those two versions are that one uses the default namespace where the other uses explicit namespaces prefixes. Both versions of the XML document demonstrate the problem: The program accepts zero or more XPath expression on the command line.  The first XPath expression is applied to the Document.  Subsequent XPath expressions are applied to the result of the previous XPath expression.  If the result is a node-set, then the first member of that node set is used for the subsequent test. If you compile and run the program using the inputs specified below, the first XPath: '//*[@xlink:href]' will select all XLink elements in the XML document. The second XPath: 'ibis:positionRef' _SHOULD_ match on the &amp;lt;ibis:positionRef&amp;gt; XLink, but that match is failing, which is the problem. ------------------ To compile: javac -classpath WEB-INF/lib/dom4j-full.jar XPathContextNodeBug.java To run: java -classpath WEB-INF/lib/dom4j-full.jar\;.

    <body>All, A colleague has pointed out that an XPath expression is, by default, evaluated against the children of the context node.  Therefore you have to use an XPath expression such as: 'self::ibis:positionRef' to test against the QName of the context node itself.  If you only specify 'ibis:positionRef' then the test is performed on the node set formed by the CHILDREN of the context node. The conclusion?  No bug.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] [ElementHandler] Managing exceptions</header>
    <body>Hi,  When parsing an XML file using ElementHandler implementations, we often need to be able to stop the reading process. Reasons can be an error managed in the handler or an event triggered after a push on a Cancel button in a user interface.  To be able to interrupt the process (typically, a cancelled operation) during a parsing, I created the ElementHandlerException class that is declared to be thrown by each method of an ElementHandler:    /** &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;ElementHandlerException&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is a SAXException which may be thrown * during the processing, by ElementHandler instances, of a DOM4J document. */      element path processing.  element path processing.   Then, I updated org.dom4j.io.SAXContentHandler so that methods startElement and endElement throw a SAXException. I also updated org.dom4j.io.DispatchHandler so that methods onStart and onEnd throw an ElementHandlerException.  Doing this keeps compatibility with older versions and allow to manage an ElementHandlerException during parsing (below is a sample code):    process has been cancelled   Do you think such exception handling mechanism could be part of the Dom4j distribution? I read some messages in the list last year about this problem.  Best, Christophe</body>

This doen't look like a big change but will give some extra flexibility for reporting. Regards, -Dmitri -- 8&amp;lt; snip snip ---------------------------------------------- I agree with Dmitri. For my own needs, I patched a few dom4j classes and I'd like to share it with you. It concerns [org.dom4j.io.OutputFormat], and classes that use it directly, including [org.dom4j.io.SAXValidator] or more accurately [org.dom4j.io.DocumentInputSource#getCharacterStream()], and of course [org.dom4j.io.XMLWriter]. I needed a XML formatter that would not display the attributes of elements on a single line, but rather, one underneath the other, with a nice indent matching the namespace declaration indent (right of fullyQualifiedElementName + one space) . It would typically look like this: -- BEGIN XML ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- END XML ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- This way, I could get more accurate errors from the validator, when errors associated to attributes occur. (The line number would match a line containing a single attribute) Remember, dom4j doesn't perform validation, this work is delegated to the SAX parser in use (I personnaly use Xerces). This is achieved by parsing an XML file (xmlReader.parse("FILE_URL")), or by using a DocumentInputSource to allow validation from an already loaded XML document (in a dom4j DOM-like structure). In fact, the dom4j SaxValidator wrapper does the job for us, so we don't have to care about all the InputSource stuff. Unfortunately, the default XML format used when performing validation through SaxValidator is a compact format, with no indent, no space... So this is pretty useless when we want to use line/column information. So my aim is to format the in-memory XML document (the dom4j document model) into a format that I need (with attributes new lines and stuff...), and then perform validation. To achieve that, I created 4 classes, directly inspired (most of them derivated) from the original dom4j classes. 1) MyOutputFormat 2) MyXMLWriter 3) MyDocumentInputSource 4) MySAXValidator /!\     It is important to mention that the dom4j JAR is included in my classpath, I'm not using the dom4j sources directly. (I haven't modified the original source code) ============================================================= 1) MyOutputFormat ============================================================= This is a subclass of [org.dom4j.io.OutputFormat]. [org.dom4j.io.OutputFormat] is public, so I put [MyOutputFormat] in the [whatever.Package.Namespace] package. -- BEGIN CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- END CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ============================================================= 2) MyXMLWriter ============================================================= Here it gets a little more complicated as the original class uses a lot of references to the original [org.dom4j.io.OutputFormat] (That we simply have to replace by [whatever.Package.Namespace.MyOutputFormat] ) : -- BEGIN CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ... ... ... ... ... ... public XMLWriter(OutputStream out, OutputFormat format) throws ... ... ... ... -- END CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...and we also need to patch [protected void writeAttributes(Element element) throws IOException] so that Attributes are written with new lines, if the format says so: -- BEGIN CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- declaration // ######################### BEGIN ADDED STUFF ############## space // ######################### END ADDED STUFF ############## -- END CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The nicest way to implement all these changes would have been to subclass [org.dom4j.io.XMLWriter], but because the private member [namespaceStack] is used in [writeAttributes], I finally decided to copy/paste the code to a new class [whateverPackageNamespace.MyXMLWriter], and apply the changes. Appart from the ugly code redondancy implied, this works nicely. ============================================================= 3) MyDocumentInputSource ============================================================= Now, we need to patch [org.dom4j.io.DocumentInputSource], so that [whateverPackageNamespace.MyOutputFormat] is used instead of [org.dom4j.io.OutputFormat]. Because this class is only public to the [org.dom4j.io] package, if I want to subclass it, I have to create the class in the [org.dom4j.io] package. Here is the result: -- BEGIN CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- END CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ============================================================= 4) MySAXValidator ============================================================= Finally, we need to change [org.dom4j.io.SAXValidator] so that the new [org.dom4j.io.MyDocumentInputSource] is used. [org.dom4j.io.SAXValidator] is public, so I can put [MySAXValidator] in any package. -- BEGIN CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- END CODE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ######################### AND FINALLY ! Now, here is how I validate the document, and get the errors: xmlReader.setFeature(" ######################### CONCLUSION The nice thing is that I now can display the results in 2 panes: - one that contains a List widget which entries correspond to errors - the other one that contains a srolling hillighted text area corresponding to the formatted XML When I click on an List's element, the scrolling text scrolls to the line of the error, and a red marker points to the corresponding column. REQUESTS: - Please make [org.dom4j.io.XMLWriter#namespaceStack] protected or put a getter for it. That way, we could subclass XMLWriter easily. - Make [org.dom4j.io.DocumentInputSource] public, so that we can extend it outside of package - Integrate the new formatting scheme (new lines after each element's attribute) Hope this inspired some of you, and if you see any ways of improving things, please let me know.

If it is then cast it to a SAXParseException and you can retrieve the line and column from it.  This will give you access to the line and column, but I am not convienced that every DocumentException will always contain that information. Thoughts?

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] DOM4J implementation in Ozone</header>
    <body>Hi Mike, Thanks for your reply. There are other constraints than I mentioned. Ozone, being both an object repository and an application server, works similar to RMI in the sense that you define an interface (e.g. Foo) and an implementation of that interface (e.g. FooImpl). Foo extends OzoneRemote which is a marker interface similar to Remote in RMI. FooImpl extends OzoneObject similar to UnicastRemoteObject in RMI (or you could implement OzoneCompatible if the implementation class already inherits from another class). The proxy classes are generated by a post processor (OPP) similar to what you would use rmic for in RMI. When creating the Ozone implementation of DOM4J I've basically created an OzoneInterface class for any DOM4J interface that extends the DOM4J interface (e.g. Element would be subclassed by OzoneElement) as well as OzoneRemote. Then I've created an implementation class that extends the tree implementation (e.g DefaultElement) and also implents OzoneCompatible to make it persistable. This way all the XML operations will take place on the server side and all DOM4J objects are persisted in Ozone. In order to be able to do this I needed to change the following things with the DOM4J code base: * Created an OzoneDocumentHelper that is used instead of DocumentHelper * Created an Interface for DocumentFactory and renamed the old DocumentFactory to DocumentFactoryImpl. Then I've extends the the DocumentFactory interface with a PersistentDocumentFactory that allows for Documents to be "named" so they can be retrieved from Ozone using its given name later. Two methods are added in that interface: * Created an interface to NameSpace and Qname as i mentioned in my last post. When using it most of the Ozone stuff is hidden and you are working only with the DOM4J API except for some bootstrapping that is needed to connect to the server e.g. ExternalDatabase db = ExternalDatabase.openDatabase("ozonedb: At this stage I can create and modify XML just fine with my implementation and I'm now looking to support more of the DOM4J API e.g XPath and better ways to load XML documents from files. I have not checked any of my stuff into the Ozone CVS repository and I'm hesitant to do so right now since I would prefer to use the official DOM4J API instead of what is currently DOM4J with some modifications of mine so I'm hoping for some indication wether the modifications I suggested can be accepted by the DOM4J team in one form or another. I wonder what to do with my modified version if it out of the question to change the API to use interfaces for the three classes mentioned above? Should I then change the package names for my modified org.dom4j.*** sources so it does not conflict with the real one to avoid possible confusion? Please advise.

    <body>There is a lot of code that uses DocumentHelper and DocumentFactory via its static interfaces.  I would suggest we use abstract base classes for these that delegate to an inherited instance.  That way you can configure both of them to use your specialized class without modifying existing code base.

Lucas wrote: I'm not proposing to change DocumentHelper at all since it nature with only static methods does not leave much options. That is why I created an OzoneDocumentHelper that looks as closely as the DocumentHelper that I could make it to make usage familiar. For DocumentFactory however it is trickier since it is part of the API. Again making DocumentFactory an interface and rename the current DocumentFactory class to DocumentFactoryImpl should not really change the dom4j code that much. I mean, nothing in the interfaces needs to change but the places where there was previously a DocumentFactory.getInstance() needs to change to DocumentFactoryImpl.getInstance() instead. This change of changing DocumentFactory to an interface allows me to override getDocumentFactory() in all the OzoneXXX subclasses (e.g OzoneElementImpl) so that a proxy to my OzoneFactoryImpl is returned instead. Sure, no problem. I've just uploaded it in a jar file to sourceForge at  file name is dom4jInOzone.jar. Best reagrds, Per</body>

    <body>Hi David, I like that name. :-) I can't say I have seen any issues with memory and DOM4J.  But with standard GC, it is difficult to say when a reference will get GCed. If you null out the Document reference and have no other Element references in use, the tree should be GCed with the exception of cached items like QNames, Namespaces, etc. Is there a particular problem you are trying to solve?

    <body>That is something we should look into.  I am not sure if we are using Weak References vi WeakHashMap anywhere.  One reason would be that Weak References were introduced in JDK 1.2.  I am not sure if we are now only supporting JDK 1.2 or not.  If that decision is made, then moving to Weak References makes sense. As for DOM4J holding back due to references, I think the QNames and Namespaces are self contained. So they do not reference any nodes or elements with a link to other elements.  Based on that, I think when you are done with a document and its sub-elements/nodes, it will disappear as soon as the GC is ready. BTW, if you have a large document and only need one portion, you can detach the leaf that you want to work with, thus freeing up the remaining Document and nodes for a GC. James, any comments?

    <header>[dom4j-dev] data type attribute for sort criteria</header>
    <body>Hello, I wonder if there is a way to tell DOM4J the type of the sort criteria given at the XPath.selectNodes() method ? We are trying to sort number data but dom4j is considering them as strings (giving as a result that 12 is after 100 :-) I quickly check the org.dom4j.xpath.DefaultXPath source code but did not see anything that could help us. A mecanism similar of the one used by XSLT would be very nice (datatype=NUMERIC | TEXT) Is there a good reason why this is not implemented ? Is there anything much more complicated that I missed ? Is there anybody already working on that ?  If no, can I start implementing it ? Thanks for your help Seb</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] data type attribute for sort criteria</header>
    <body>I believe you can create your own xpath expression to sort the list on the selectNodes.  The comparison parameter is an XPath expression that yields a value that will be used to sort the main element upon.  You do not need to use the exact same number to solve this.  Using some math and knowing the maximum size, you can still sort this as a number. Try something like: Remember to divide by a number larger than the maximum number of digits. We end up with elements being sorted correctly, even though the values that are being used are slightly modified. :-) Enjoy!

    <body>This will not work for all cases.  It appears that there is a resolution with this.

    <body>If you want to use Java to sort it, then use the Collections class to modify the List (this will impact your XML layout if you send it back out an XMLWriter).  Try the following snippet of code. Note that the Comparator does not need to be created every time.  Just create it once and reuse it. Perhaps a global version.  Also you may want to optimize it with other comparison patterns. =============================================================== =============================================================== Again, best wishes!

    <body>Hello, Just wanted to find out if there are any changes in DOM4J implementations since then to support this request. We are running into this issue where default namespaces are introduced in the XML at a later stage when  prefixless, //*[name()='...'] less xPaths are already coded all over. I do realize that it is recommended( and compliant ) way to use xPaths with prefix or  incase of default namespaces use //*[name() = '....']. What we would love to do is to keep the existing code bases the same and if possible change  the underlying APIs that we commonly use like selectNodes() or selectSingleNode and valueOf  ( possibly some more) to format the xPath in such a way so that they work on both 'default namespaced'  or 'prefix: namespaced'  or 'plain vanilla' XML file. just wanted to find out if the approach we a re taking is flawed and if so any other recommendations from this mailing list..

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Thread-safe issue?</header>
    <body>I do not understand what you are trying to accomplish. Reading is not a problem, but the list is a "live" list.  You modify the order or remove something and that element disappears from the parent. The problem is not you reading, it is someone else writing/modifying the contents.  If you just want a snapshot of the children to iterate over without any runtime exception due to modification, then convert the List to an array with the toArray() method.  This will give you an snapshot to loop over while the element may continue to be modified. BUT, the elements you iterate over can still be modified.  This is still a dangerous game, synchronized or not. The only safe way is to create a deep copy of the list in question so you have a read only copy.  Anything else is asking for trouble. Regardless of framework, modifying an active List is dangerous, even with synchronized collections. Hope that helps.

    <body>The call sequence is:  -&amp;gt;   createSingleResultList() in AbstractBranch -&amp;gt;   contentList() in DefaultElement when creating the BackedList.  By the way, I don't have a simplify sample, however, this is a trim down version of the call sequence:  1. Main thread create a document from DocumentHelper.parseText( 2. Main thread spawn 2 sub-threads, in which each sub-threads do a 3. Check the document in the main thread when both sub-threads is done.  When running this on a multiple-cpu machine, the element "x" now contains an ArrayList as the content, which contains ANOTHER ArrayList. Since this is a multi-threading issue, you may need to run the testcase many times in order to capture the problem...

    <body>I'm 100% agreed on "Optimal performance can only be achieved when multiple parts produce minimal friction." But what we have here now is that the dom4j dom itself is the friction across threads... What we have here is the main thread accepting xml request, and then spawn some worker threads to do different jobs based on the input (like sending email, running a report, and so on). The advantage to use multiple threads here is that the main thread don't need to block/wait until all jobs is completed... (for example, a sub-job is used to create server log, which really doesn't matter if it is completed or not). Notices that this problem existed even if we don't modify the dom once it is created. And I still can't believed that the dom4j dom should NOT be read in multiple threads... From what I see, the DefaultElement is not thread-safed in the sense that not only during creation time, but also during read operations, which limited dom4j to be used in one and only one thread, which I think is an issue. Hope this clarify the problem. Thanks again for all your help. William. -----Original Message----- From: David D.

    <body>The current design is not thread-hot.  A term that follows me from the days of C++ and RogueWave software.  Collections are typically not thread-hot by default.  You require a synchronized mutation for the collection and any iterators it gives out.  This is a major performance hit.  Just look at the impact Vector had on us. I vote for implementation that separates the different processing.  You have one thread processing XML.  Why don't you have the main create "requests" using the Command pattern for each type you are receiving and as you process the document, you can drop the work off in a Queue that the worker threads can pick up and process.  This would make seperation of concerns cleaner.  The work of handling the incoming document processing can be separate to the processing of the "logical request". Here is an example: Thread1                                     WorkerThread2 This way you can scale by increasing the number of workers. If there is a lot of asynchronous work.  This implementation puts the synchronization on the Queue and off of the remaining threads. Another idea is to take advantage of blocking requests. When one thread blocks, we don't want it blocking due to another thread, unless it is idle like waiting on the Queue.  The WorkerThread2 will process the incoming request and eventually block itself on I/O like a database. This block during work could cause more threading issues if that thread has maintained a lock on the Element or a List shared by other threads. I maintain that DOM4J was not intended to pass Elements between threads, but that XML parsing and building would no impact other threads parsing and building capability.  Only shared resources within DOM4J are protected.  Document parsing and building is expected to be done and the results used inside the same thread. If I am way off base here, someone jump in and correct me. But I do large scale software development for a living and have used similar patterns described above with huge success.

    <header>RE: [dom4j-dev] Thread-safe issue?</header>
    <body>Hi David, First of all, thanks for the suggestion, and I also agreed that there are millions of different ways to write multi-threading program without passing the dom around. However, this is not the issue I'm looking at... The issue is whether we need exclusive lock for all element operations. The closer thing I can think of is the Java's HashMap, which is known to be thread-unsafe and that exclusive lock is required for any update operation... However, only "read-lock" is required for navigation (or element look up), and concurrent lookup will not destroy the map internal structure. Without any changes, here is what we have for DOM4J: "EXCLUSIVE lock is required for ALL element operations, not only update operations. Failing to do so will destroy the dom internal structure and the dom will no longer valid to be used." and this also match your disclaimer stated in your message: 'Document parsing and building is expected to be done and the results used inside the same thread.' However, this also limit the usage of DOM4J in any enterprise-wise applications, and I didn't aware of any other xml document structure with the same limitation... Since this is caused by the lazy array initialization in the DefaultElement, what we are discussing here is the potential of removing this "smarties" such that at least the dom can be "read" or "navigate" in multi-threads without the EXCLUSIVE lock... (of course READ-LOCK is still required in case some other threads updating the dom). And I'll leave this to you folks to decided whether this limitation is the design or is an issue... Again, thanks for all your time and effort on this issue. Regards, William. By the way, the changes I made only fixed half the problem.. The problem still exist for element without any child...and the full fix is to remove the "lazy array initialization" totally. I'll do some performance benchmark later to see the effect of this changes. -----Original Message----- From: David D.

    <header>RE: [dom4j-dev] Thread-safe issue?</header>
    <body>Seem like all I need is to use the "NonLazyDocumentFactory", and the "NonLazyElement" defined in the dom4j.util package. Is there a way to set up Dom4J to use this factory and element as the default? I means, is there any setting(s) I can set such that DocumentHelper, SAXParser, etc can pick it up? Thanks again for all your help. William. -----Original Message----- From: Lee, William Sent: Saturday, April 12, 2003 9:41 AM To: 'David D. Lucas'; Lee, William Cc: 'Mike Skells'; dom4j-dev@... Subject: RE: [dom4j-dev] Thread-safe issue? Hi David, First of all, thanks for the suggestion, and I also agreed that there are millions of different ways to write multi-threading program without passing the dom around. However, this is not the issue I'm looking at... The issue is whether we need exclusive lock for all element operations. The closer thing I can think of is the Java's HashMap, which is known to be thread-unsafe and that exclusive lock is required for any update operation... However, only "read-lock" is required for navigation (or element look up), and concurrent lookup will not destroy the map internal structure. Without any changes, here is what we have for DOM4J: "EXCLUSIVE lock is required for ALL element operations, not only update operations. Failing to do so will destroy the dom internal structure and the dom will no longer valid to be used." and this also match your disclaimer stated in your message: 'Document parsing and building is expected to be done and the results used inside the same thread.' However, this also limit the usage of DOM4J in any enterprise-wise applications, and I didn't aware of any other xml document structure with the same limitation... Since this is caused by the lazy array initialization in the DefaultElement, what we are discussing here is the potential of removing this "smarties" such that at least the dom can be "read" or "navigate" in multi-threads without the EXCLUSIVE lock... (of course READ-LOCK is still required in case some other threads updating the dom). And I'll leave this to you folks to decided whether this limitation is the design or is an issue... Again, thanks for all your time and effort on this issue. Regards, William. By the way, the changes I made only fixed half the problem.. The problem still exist for element without any child...and the full fix is to remove the "lazy array initialization" totally. I'll do some performance benchmark later to see the effect of this changes. -----Original Message----- From: David D. Lucas [mailto:ddlucas@...] Sent: Friday, April 11, 2003 3:20 PM To: Lee, William Cc: 'Mike Skells'; dom4j-dev@... Subject: Re: [dom4j-dev] Thread-safe issue? The current design is not thread-hot.  A term that follows me from the days of C++ and RogueWave software.  Collections are typically not thread-hot by default.  You require a synchronized mutation for the collection and any iterators it gives out.  This is a major performance hit.  Just look at the impact Vector had on us. I vote for implementation that separates the different processing.  You have one thread processing XML.  Why don't you have the main create "requests" using the Command pattern for each type you are receiving and as you process the document, you can drop the work off in a Queue that the worker threads can pick up and process.  This would make seperation of concerns cleaner.  The work of handling the incoming document processing can be separate to the processing of the "logical request". Here is an example: Thread1                                     WorkerThread2 This way you can scale by increasing the number of workers. If there is a lot of asynchronous work.  This implementation puts the synchronization on the Queue and off of the remaining threads. Another idea is to take advantage of blocking requests. When one thread blocks, we don't want it blocking due to another thread, unless it is idle like waiting on the Queue.  The WorkerThread2 will process the incoming request and eventually block itself on I/O like a database. This block during work could cause more threading issues if that thread has maintained a lock on the Element or a List shared by other threads. I maintain that DOM4J was not intended to pass Elements between threads, but that XML parsing and building would no impact other threads parsing and building capability.  Only shared resources within DOM4J are protected.  Document parsing and building is expected to be done and the results used inside the same thread. If I am way off base here, someone jump in and correct me. But I do large scale software development for a living and have used similar patterns described above with huge success. I hope it makes sense. My 2 cents.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Thread-safe issue?</header>
    <body>Lee, I was not sure what to post here. I ended up writing about 1000 words ranting on about multithreading and shared resources.  I will give you the shorter version (under 350 words ;-) ). Here are my thoughts: 1) Xerces DOM is not thread safe. I believe over 90% of the XML use in the Java Enterprise today is using this API.  So perhaps you should rethink your previous comment: Please look over the FAQ for Xerces at  Is Xerces DOM implementation thread-safe? No. DOM does not require implementations to be thread safe. If you need to access the DOM from multiple threads, you are required to add the appropriate locks to your application code. So to disspell any misconceptions... DOM4J IS A GREAT API FOR DOING ENTERPRISE WIDE XML APPLICATIONS ! 2) I see a theme throughout the posts.  Shared resources in a multithreaded environment. I recommend reading Patterns in Java Volume 1 and focus on the Producer-Consumer pattern and put on its queue an object that is from the command pattern.  The command object should have a copy of the data needed to execute the "sub-job".  The copy will avoid thread locking issues.  And if you decide in the future to modify the "Producer" of these "sub-jobs" you will not have to modify the "Consumer" that handles the tasks. 3) For the simplest design, I am glad it is implemented the way it currently is. Otherwise I would be paying a big penalty for using synchronization when I don't need it. 4) I believe you are suffering from a design issue that exposes a tightly coupled design.  The reason folks don't like to perform Two-Phase-Commits against multiple resources, is.... yes, performance.  Please do not suggest that the remaing 90% suffer from you enhancement request. 5) I hope that using the "NonLazyDocumentFactory" is an effective work around.  But I wonder if you are taking advantage of decoupling and allowing your multiple threads to run without blocking on your resources. Maybe you and I are not on the same page.  If nothing else, maybe you will review the "Producer-Consumer" Pattern.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] dom4j still alive?</header>
    <body>I've been recommended dom4j to developers for the last year and a half, but I'm growing increasingly concerned about the lack of any follow-up since the 1.3 release. I pointed out a serious performance issue with the 1.3 release a year ago, and there've also been a number of other fixes in CVS. This doesn't help most users who just download the latest release, though. I'm having an increasingly hard time justifying dom4j as a solution when it goes more than a year between releases. James, if you're unable to do a maintenance release perhaps one of the other developers can do this? I think dom4j is an excellent document model and I'd hate to see it die through neglect of basic maintenance after all the work that's gone into it. - Dennis</body>

    <body>I'm in the process of re-writing the XML support for the Ozone OODBMS project ( DOM we had before. The proxy based architecture of Ozone where all objects are executed and persisted on the server side requires the use of interfaces for the api in order to be able to generate proxies that invokes methods and marshalls the result between the client and the server. The only issue I've found so far is that Namespace and QName though part of the API are concrete classes instead of interfaces. I can code around this but it will make the code much more complicated to handle this and I was just wondering if you have considered or could consider changing it so that there is a Namespace interface and a concrete Namespace implementation class and similarly for QName?

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Thread-safe issue?</header>
    <body>Hi all, I'm currently encounter the following thread-safe issue, and would like to see if anyone out there experience the same issue... I create a sample doc: &amp;lt;x&amp;gt;&amp;lt;y&amp;gt;z&amp;lt;/y&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/x&amp;gt;, and since y is the only child of x, the "content" of x will be set to the element "y". However, after I call x.elements("y"), the "content" of x will becomes an ArraryList (with one element "y"). Indeed, when I trace down the code, seems like all operations that returns a list or backedlist will indeed modify the internal structure of the dom (from node to ArrayList). I understand that we should guard all update operations, but seems like we must also guard all navigation operations as well? Is there any workaround without blocking all these operations among different threads? Thanks in advance for your help. William. This message may contain privileged and/or confidential information.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Thread-safe issue?</header>
    <body>The issue you are running into is not a DOM4J issue. Any reference in java that is being accessed by multiple threads has the opportunity to be updated by each thread.  The only way to work around this is to use synchronization or read-only copies of the objects pointed to by the references.  Synchronization is the easiest to implement but kills performance.  Read-Only copies of a DOM is just too complicated, bloated, and time consuming. I have done a lot of XML work in Java and have not found a case for using more than one thread to process an XML Document.  I have multiple threads, but I parse, process, and build a response using the same thread.  For improving performance I have used asyncronous calls inside my processing, but I found no need to seperate the elements of a document into multiple threads.  It is more trouble than what you probably need. What exactly is driving the desire for multi-threaded access to different elements inside the tree?

    <body>Hi all, I had posted the following message onto the user list but do not get any response yet. Hope you folks can give me a hand. Thanks in advance for all your help. William. ---------------------------------------- Could someone shed some lights on the following issue, please? An element e1, with namespaced attribute xyz:a1, from an existing document is added onto a new document using the "createCopy" method. The namespace xyz of a1 is declared in one of the parent of e1. However, when I use the SAXWriter on the new document, I didn't receive the "startPrefixMapping" event for the namespace "xyz". After investigation, seems like the namespace node of "xyz" is not appended onto the new document because it is not part of the content of the element e1, and therefore no startPrefixMapping... My question is, which step goes wrong? Should the createCopy "smart" enough to include the namespace of the attributes from the parent (which I doubt it should)? Or should the SAXWriter also dump out the namespaces of the attributes if required (which I'm not sure either)? Or should we manually walkthrough all namespaced attributes and add the corresponding namespace node manually after createCopy() (which I certain hope not the case!)...

    <header>[dom4j-dev] UPGRADE: Dom4j 1.4 JAR files [Jaxen + SaxPath included]</header>
    <body>Hi ! I'm trying to include the dom4j 1.4 library the best way I can in my applications. (Smallest dom4j JAR =&amp;gt; core distribution, and separate Jaxen and SaxPath JARs) This was fine before 1.4, but now: There are currently 3 ways of doing so, by getting the JAR file from: -  The Maven repository:  - The main ZIP distribution:  Choosing either: As far as I understand, [dom4j-1.4.jar] obtained from the Maven repository is the same JAR as [dom4j.jar] from the ZIP distribution (475 KB) So we are left with a "full" JAR and a "normal" JAR. The "full" JAR seems to contains all the JDOM/DOM stuff coming from the Jaxen distribution, whereas the "normal" JAR seems to only contain the Dom4j-related stuff. (Tell me if I'm wrong) Before 1.4, I used to have a dom4j CORE package which only contained the org/dom4j/** classes, and I had Jaxen and SaxPath in separate JARs: - [jaxen-core.jar] with org/jaxen/** classes - [jaxen-dom4j.jar] with org/jaxen/dom4j/** classes only both obtained from  and: - [saxpath.jar] with org/saxpath/** and com/werken/saxpath/** classes obtained from  ADDED CLASSES: I want to have the same layout while migrating to dom4j 1.4, but it seems that some classes have been added to SaxPath and Jaxen, it's easy to see by comparing: [jaxen-core.jar], [jaxen-dom4j.jar], [saxpath.jar] with [dom4j.jar]. Are those classes (seem to be test programs) necessary ? MODIFIED SOURCES ? : Jaxen and SaxPath are both available as 1.0 FCS, but some dom4j 1.4 bugfixes mention SaxPath issues, so I'm wondering the bundled Jaxen/SaxPath in dom4j 1.4 are modified versions of 1.0 FCS, or if the bugs have been fixed using workarounds in the dom4j code. If there hasn't been any modifications in Jaxen and SaxPath code since their FCS, then I'll just remove all Jaxen/SaxPath classes from dom4j.jar (including the Jaxen/dom4j special wrappers), in order to have my custom dom4j-core.jar ! (as it is not available out of the box) Then I'll just keep the separate Jaxen/SaxPath JARs from the 1.0 FCS releases. Can I do that, without risking to "downgrade" either Jaxen or SaxPath ? Thanks for a quick reply, as I'm looking forward to start using dom4j 1.4 ! Daniel/</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Re: [dom4j-user] RE: Dom4j still alive?</header>
    <body>Hi, I agree Daniel, Dom4J is really a good project. In my opinion it is a very good designed set of packages for the java community. It has not all the heavy constraints (mainly due to implicite validation consideration in the DOM model leading to strange limitation in the DOM api) and still offers a nice hierarchical structure that is IMOO more consistent (in an object model point of view) than JDom. So I join 100% Daniel's comments and hope that : o James is still in good health :-) (independly from the Dom4J project) o No technical "cul de sac"/dead end arrose since the last release o James is still anthousiastic about his work o We will soon have news about the 1.4 release progress/roadmap Concerning the project itself. I would like to outline that Dom4j was first meant to provide a simple and efficient way to deal with XML in JAVA. This is almost achieved and the result is really great !! However my feeling is that the XMLSchema features (e.g. Datatypes) are not really part of XML. I mean that we can think of XMLSchema as an already specific application/extension of XML and thus I think DOM4J's core realease should not become late because of the XMLSchema features. have all there cons &amp;amp; pros (XML Schema but also DTD,Trex, Schematron, Examplotron, SOX,...). XML core is not dependant on validation  nor are the Dom4j core functionalities. Furthermore it is possible to validate XML in java with a lots of apis that do not depend on Dom4j. As you may have guessed, my concerne is about Dom4J loosing its simplicity and maybe its consistency just by trying to implement some XMLSchema features. I know it is not easy to resist to take into account new concepts like DataTypes but since these concepts are not part of the core concept of XML, shouldn't they belong to a separate project. For exemple datatype may be linked to elements and attibutes in many ways that are not necessarely based on an XMLSchema, this binding could be achieved in a interface based framework that is not dédicated to Dom4j but that supports Dom4J documents as an input source and so on...The same feeling appears regarding the XSLT extension in Dom4j. Thus i am affraid that energy on this project is spread over several sub-projects that are not really part of the initial goal of Dom4j and lead to a weaker overall mobilisation. Is it possible to consider some kind of Dom4j core  project (Object model + Xpath support + namespace support + I/O) and have a separate release strategy for XMLSchema and XSLT supports? This may help consolidate the core technology faster... But this is just my own (modest) feeling (exposed in a quick &amp;amp; dirty way), I would be glad to read other people opinions about these concerns In any cases Dom4J is a very nice project, thank you James for this great work!

This is valid XML, according to the XML-definition, but I have problems identifying these elements with your XPath component. I get the following error: org.dom4j.InvalidXPathException: Invalid XPath expression: /OBJECT/impl/OBJECT/_catalog/OBJECT/n (DefaultXPath.java:316) (DefaultXPath.java:63) (DocumentFactory.java:182) (AbstractNode.java:207) (AbstractNode.java:187) com.cyrone.db.designer.DbSchemaReader.generateDat abaseModel(DbSchemaReader.java:28) com.cyrone.db.designer.DbSchemaReaderTest.testGen erateDatabaseModel(DbSchemaReaderTest.java:49) (Native Method) (NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke (DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) com.cyrone.db.designer.DbSchemaReaderTest.main (DbSchemaReaderTest.java:26) It is possible to avoid the error by using the XPath /OBJECT/impl/OBJECT/child::_catalog/OBJECT/n ame instead. This will work as expected, and give me the desired node. I have tried to check the XPath specifications, but have not been able to find any details on the syntax of the location path. It might be that it is not allowed to use an underscore name directly in the location path. But since a name that starts with underscore is valid in XML I would have thought that XPath would allow the same.

    <body>I strongly believe that content is the issue.  It is currently being used as an Object that morphs from a single node to a list depending on what has been added.  The SAXWriter error seems to indicate that two threads are manipulating a node inside the DOM4J Document.  Based on what you had mentioned was going on I do not understand the conditions that is causing the SAXWriter. What might help (for content and attributes) is to create a thin class that acts like a composite and handles both single and list instances for children.  Then we can control inside this class the read/write locking. David, if you can create a small test case to recreate the issue it would really help in fixing it.

    <body>I have a server that has multiple threads processing the same transform on different input data.  The transforms are Saxon Transformer objects I instantiate from a dom4j Document: When the Transformer is instantiated, the DocumentSource streams SAX events from the dom4J tree to Saxon.  It's during this time that the error occurs. This *shouldn't* be a problem, since I'm *reading* from the dom4J tree simutaneously in multiple threads - but it's looking like there is some non-reentrant code somewhere getting called or set up in or for the SAXWriter... which is strange.  I would assume that since each thread creates a new DocumentSource that I shouldn't have this kind of problem. I'm tied up now with some performance measuring now, or I'd build a small test program which would create 10 or so threads with DocumentSource objects streaming SAX events from the same Document to try to reproduce this.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] RE: [dom4j-user] Still getting this strange error.</header>
    <body>So the xlst is dynamicly performed on a particular XML per thread.  Each thread shares a common registry of XSLT Documents which are of the DOM4J type ??? DOM4J objects are not currently designed to be shared between different threads.  While the factories and other caching mechanisms within DOM4J are thread safe (different threads can use the API to create Document/Element/Node objects), the objects created are not thread-safe. This is true of trying to share a HashMap created by one thread and then manipulated by another. My recommendation is to populate a registry on a per thread basis. There would be significate performance boost if you do not access objects being synchronized.  I do not know your requirements for the registry or how big it is, but caching on a per thread basis can help you eliminate costly locks on otherwise shared resources. An example might be to create a class called Registry and in it's constructor, populate a member HashMap of XSLT file names as the key and the Document parsed in by DOM4J as the value. Perhaps add them as you go.  When they are added, parsing would be done inside the Registry object per instance. Then in each Transforming thread, use a ThreadLocal to cache these items. Does that make sense / help at all?

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Events API?</header>
    <body>No, SAX is a parse-event stream, whereas I'm interested in having DOM2 events (or something like it). So, think events in the style of the 'onClick' or 'onLoad' of HTML, or the java AWT event that run scripts whenever an event happens in the document. In the general case, mutation events are probably the most useful, though xml editing applications and processors of languages like XForms will make more extensive use of such a system. christian.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Question on Attribute Value</header>
    <body>Hi, I don't think you can see a newline in an attribute value. As per the XML spec, attribute values go thru a process called whitespace=20 normalization, which will remove the newline. It's the XML parser's part in= =20 the play to do this, SAXReader only intercepts messages from the parser. I don't think you'll find a parser that will offer an option to skip the=20 attribute normalization. Element contents is a more suitable place for text=20 where you want whitespace preserved.

    <body>I'm having a problem with the following type of expression in Jaxen: =20 =20 =20 =20 I've stepped through the code, and into the Jaxen code, and it seems that the expression following the AND is being evaluated against the context supplied by the document function.  We thought that the /a/b/c would be evaluated against the document stored on disk, and the /x/y/z against the current document we are running the xpath against. =20 We are using dom4j, so the expression is being evaluated like this: =20 =20 where expr is the string containing the xpath. =20 If we break the expression into just the LHS and RHS, each evaluates true standing alone.  But when combined with the AND, the LHS evals true and the RHS evals false.  I noticed in the expression when stepping through Jaxen that the RHS context references the document returned from the document() function in the LHS.  This is not what I expected. =20 Are we doing something wrong here, or is this a Jaxen bug???? =20 Thanks... =20 -David Hooker- -Sr. Architect, Platform-</body>

I could easily have missed APIs for an event model. I see the Visitor api for plugging in a validation engine, but haven't located a Schema Part 2 (Datatypes) component to plug in there.

I specifically didn't need to support mutation events, so you'd need to write code to dispatch those events. Here's a post and set of attached code proposed by Markus Bernhardt last year, which may be of interest to you:  You may just want to extend the native DOM implmentation provided by DOM4J to support DOM2 events, which might be easier but I haven't looked at the source of those classes so there may be hitches someplace. best, christian.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Attribute Quoting &amp;amp; Escaping Patch</header>
    <body>I ran into a problem yesterday with Internet Explorer that others may be interested in. I've submitted a patch to workaround the issue via the sourceforge site. The problem I was having was that IE doesn't resolve entities within event attributes properly, such as onclick. Instead, it sends the raw string to the interpreter which throws an error. XMLWriter always escapes quote characters, even though attriubtes are always written with double-quotes and single-quotes don't actually need to be escaped. Thus, any string literals in my event code caused IE to mess up. Since it's really common to use string literals in these attributes to do mouse-overs and such, the patch changes XMLWriter to only escape the quote character used to write the attribute value. In addition, it adds a field to OutputFormat to control which quote-character is used when writing attributes. best, christian.</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Dom4J "minimalist" binary release</header>
    <body>Hi, I am trying to make a "port" of dom4j for FreeBSD. In FreeBSD, we handle JAR dependencies at system level so the dom4j port would only install dom4j-full.jar as well as the docs/apidocs relative to dom4j. No other JAR file should be installed as part of dom4j as Xerces and other libraries are separate ports (on which dom4j would depend). I could port dom4j using the current binary release and install only what I need (dom4j-full.jar and docs) but the binary release is somewhat big (more than 10Mb) for what I need. Hence I was wondering if you could release a "minimal" (binary) version of dom4j... I so, I could contribute by providing you the required ant task or whatever you need. The other method I was considering is to maintain my own distribution of dom4j on my own website. But I am sure you could benefit from hosting it yourself (regarding SourceForge statistics for instance). Please tell me which method you prefer. Regards, Herve</body>

Of course only commenting of the setting of validation matters. My question is if I want to rely on the sAXParserFactory.setValidating(true), only then how does dom4j accomodate that? Another problem is that even if I not use the validation in the SAXReader constructor i.e. using "new SAXReader(xmlReader)" the above part of the code makes it a non-validating parse.

I want the files to be written in ASCII (cp1252) and with a "UTF-8" encoding header.  I know I can read documents that are in this format. When I write documents using XMLWriter however,  they are being written in EBCDIC (native encoding for the 390, of course) with a "UTF-8" header.  This is a bad combination- the file will never parse again this way.  I am passing in a  FileOutputStream to XMLWriter which appears to use OutputFormat's default encoding which is hard coded to "UTF-8". I'm using dom4j 1.4 and IBM's JDK 1.3.1 on the host.  I'm open to ideas if anybody has a better suggestion for how to write files on the host and have them be valid and capable of being re-read. Thanks, Brian</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Sorting issue with DefaultXpath.sort() and numeric data types</header>
    <body>Hi, I believe I discovered a problem with the DefaultXPath.sort() methods and how the comparator works. I was attempting to sort by the numeric value of an attribute (versus the character/string value). By way of example, consider the following two XPath expressions: (1) "number(@id)" (2) "@id". I would expect (1) to sort as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 And I would expect (2) to sort as follows: 1, 10, 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, both of them sorted as follows: 1, 10, 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Looking at the org.dom4j.xpath.DefaultXPath.java implementation, I believe the issue is that the getCompareValue(Node node) method is implemented by calling the valueOf method on the xpath expression. However, the valueOf method always returns the string value of the XPath expression. I believe it should be implemented as follows: The selectObject method returns the java.lang.Number implementation when the number() XPath function is used. I made these changes and the sort now works like I would expect it to. I found a post by James Strachan where he indicated he thought it should work this way but he had not written the test cases. However, I noticed that both selectObject and valueOf were deprecated. So now I'm wondering - 1) Is this a legitimate problem? Or am I doing to something wrong here? 1) should I submit a patch for this? what's the plan around the deprecated methods? DAn</body>

As I was telling David Hooker in an email, I have submitted a few of patches during the last year, but have not received any feedback. Those are not huge patches. I am sure that someone familiar with the code could just easily approve or reject (hopefully approve!) those patches in a few minutes. Is none of the people listed as "admin" or "developer" in this project on SF.net active anymore? That might be the case, and it's perfectly fine with me: dom4j is open source, and people come and go.

    <body>While we're discussing a new version and features of dom4j, I wanted to ask if anyone else has been using the new StAX API, and whether there's been any activity on integrating the two. I've written two classes, STAXReader and STAXWriter that respectively read and write DOM4J nodes from/to a StAX stream. If anyone else is interested, I wouldn't mind sending them out for review and comment. They're not ready for general production use, but they've worked well for my own needs.

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] StAX and JiBX (was: StAX Support?)</header>
    <body>On a related issue, I just released Beta 3a of my JiBX data binding framework ( JiBX uses an XMLPull parser (the open standard that's pretty much the basis for the event-level API in StAX), and secondly that this version includes support for using dom4j within the data binding. I just verified that my test cases still work with the new 1.5 beta 1 distribution of dom4j. I'm planning to support StAX in JiBX when decent implementations become available. From what I've seen the current ones are still beta quality, unfortunately. As for the dom4j support within the data binding, this uses custom marshaller/unmarshallers within the binding definition, so that you can designate which portions of your document are to be handled by using dom4j rather than data binding to your own objects. It's intended to give users who are basically working with data the ability to include islands of arbitrary XML within their data-bound documents. The unmarshaller is actually using a wrapped version of the XMLPull parser for input (wrapped mainly so that I can change to StAX in the future). - Dennis Christian Niles wrote: -- Dennis M.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] occasional bug in selectNodes method?</header>
    <body>Hey guys, I just finished tracking down an unhappy bug in dom4j... it seems that Node.selectNodes(String xpath) is unreliable - occasionally it returns no results when there actually are results. I've got a decorator class which reads in an xhtml document containing a form and adds stuff to the inputs - default values, validation scripts, etc. Works like a charm, dom4j is my best friend. Unfortunately, it began to break recently when I added some very strict validation to the decorator itself. I want to refuse to process a form if it contains any inputs which I'm not expecting. So as I'm decorating, I compute a set of all known inputs, then at the end, I do something like this: (the h namespace prefix has been mapped to the xhtml namespace, of course) Sometimes, this method returns all of the input elements in the form. Sometimes, it returns an empty list. Er...? I never have any trouble with my other, more complex xpath queries. Just this one. Help? I'm running dom4j from cvs from 2004-02-01 with one small patch to XMLWriter (forcing apostrophe entities to be rendered as ' instead of &amp;amp;apos; inside attribute values - thanks, internet explorer. interested in a patch, btw?) I'm going to try the latest cvs to see if it fixes the problem, but I wanted to touch base with y'all to see if anyone knows what might be up, and warn other developers to watch out for this problem.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] XMLWriter adding attributes from dtd - how to disable?</header>
    <body>hey guys. i intended to send this to the dom4j users list but am unable to subscribe, sf is complaining about unroutable addresses. so apologies in advance if this is too off-topic. i'm decorating some xhtml forms with dom4j. everything works great, with the exception of some failing xpath expressions which i've yet to develop a small unit test to demonstrate (but i will when i get a chance). anyway, my new problem is interesting. the output xhtml is adding attributes from the xhtml dtd, and is causing some layout grief in internet explorer (of course). specifically, all of my td elements are getting colspan="1" and rowspan="1" attributes, presumably because the dtd has this chunk: any ideas on how i can disable this behavior, short of hacking the dtd manually? I'm using a plain old XMLWriter instance with an OutputFormat set to XHTML true and encoding ISO-8859-1. thanks, and sorry again for the misplaced message. - donald</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] XMLWriter adding attributes from dtd - how to disable?</header>
    <body>Hi Donald, At the moment, I don't think there is a proper way to solve your issues using dom4j. The problem is that the Attributes argument of the SAX ContentHandler.startElement(...) method also contains the attributes which have a default value according to the DTD, even if they don't occur in the XML document. There is no way to tell if the attribute has been specified in the XML document or not ... This issue is addressed by the SAX2 1.1 Extensions ( dom4j.io.SAXContentHandler could be changed to check for these extensions. But I don't know how many parsers support these extensions at the moment (Aelfred2 -  probably won't be that hard to solve your problem if you are using a parser which supports these SAX2 1.1 extensions ... Could you create a RFE for this to make sure this issue doesn't get lost ...  thanks, Maarten Donald Ball wrote:</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] XMLWriter adding attributes from dtd - how to disable?</header>
    <body>Sorry that my answer may be pretty late wrt to what has been answered on the list, I'm a bit offline. I think that your problem is not solvable "as is": SAX and DOM and any other XML parsing interfaces are lacking this notion of indicating that an attribute is actually only coming from the DTD hence should, if faithfulness is wished, not be re-output. It would not be very hard to extend these technologies for this purpose and would even be probably easy to modify something like Saxon's AElfred... just... it's not there. I would be very interested, for many other purposes, to get a grip on this information on Attribute objects, be them in SAX, dom4j, or JDOM. Internet Explorer or any other application is, however, wrong to consider it different to have or not to have this attribute present... but that's another story. paul On 6-Apr-04, at 19:21 Uhr, Donald Ball wrote:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] problems with XPath, stylesheet rules and namespaces</header>
    <body>I'm having difficulty using Rules with XPath patterns to select attributes that have a namespace prefix. The example document: The XPath queries: I'm trying to create two rules, one that matches only the max:headroom attribute and another that matches any element with a max:headroom attribute.  The behavior when using Rules and XPath patterns is different than the behavior I would expected based on what selectNodes () returns.  I've included a failing unit test at the end of this message that either demonstrates a bug or my own misunderstandings. Given the document and queries above, I would expect each query to match a single node.  Creating a Document and calling doc.selectNodes() confirms my expectation, i.e. calling doc.selectNodes("//@headroom") returns a list containing only the headroom='blip' attribute. However, I get unexpected behavior when using the same XPath queries as patterns for stylesheet rules.  Using the following pattern matches both headroom and max:headroom attributes: Even more suprising, createPattern("//@max:headroom") also matches both attributes. Please elucidate me :) Thanks, Tim In the following test case, only test_directXPathQueries() passes: =======================================================================</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] The case for a value-based equals() in dom4J</header>
    <body>I use dom4j for almost all my XML work because its API is so intuitive and I can build apps faster with it. However, I do not like the way dom4j uses reference equality for objects, which is done for "performance reasons" according to the FAQ. I'll make a case for this to be changed.  There is already an operator defined for reference equality: ==. There is obviously another type of equality between XML fragments, based on their value, and I think it is the intention of the equals() method to enable that type of equality to be evaluated. Although the performance costs for calling equals() on a large branch node is great, I believe this is the users choice, as e.g. calling equals() on an attribute is not expensive, and yet useful.  The solution described in the FAQ (use a NodeComparitor) only works when the evaluation is explicit. The problem I have is that I like to use the Collections APIs, and they rely heavily on equals() being defined. Combined with the fact that I'm working with multiple XML docs with the same tags in them, so I cannot rely on reference equality as a "cheap" substitute, as you might in a single document with unique nodes.  Perhaps there could be some global or document-wide switch specified at creation time that controlled the equals() method? Such as switch would have minimal performance cost, as branches that are usually taken one way hardly slow down modern CPUs.

For example, take the following simple HTML file: Mary had a little lamb. Hello, this is a test. If this file is created using a Windows text editor, then read in with a SaxReader and the resulting Document object is written out to a file using HTMLWriter, both "Mary had a little lamb" and "Hello, this is a test." are not written out to the file.

Since you provide an absolute path to the node which doesn't belong to a document anymore, it should return null. However, your code illustrates another bug in dom4j: the getPath() method on the detached node should not return an absolute path in this situation, it should return a relative path selecting itself: "." should be returned instead of "/b".

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Bug in AbstractElement.Accept ?</header>
    <body>Hi, There seems to be an assumption that a visitor cannot modify the structure built into the code into AbstractElement.accept(Visitor) the length of the attributes and the content is cached so that if the visitor modifies the content then NPE can occur, or nodes can be missed  Is there something in the visitor pattern that means that the visitor cannot make changes (None that I am aware of)  This is from the postings on the user newsgroug under 'Removing Nodes'  ------------------------------------ Hi, The first method fails because there is a bug in the AbstractElement.accept(Visitor) method IMHO accept should not assume that the visitor will not change the structure of the element, and it caches the element &amp;amp; attribute counts for performmance. Is there any reason why a visitor should not modify the content?. I will start a separate post regarding this The second method failes because you are attempting to remove the node from the document, not the parent node. If you use n.getParent().remove(n), or better still n.detach() Then it works  mailto:dom4j-user-admin@...] On Behalf Of</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Bug in AbstractElement.Accept ?</header>
    <body>Mike, I guess the main reason is that traversing the dom tree becomes difficult if the structure can change while traversing it. For instance: if the visitor adds new elements, it's possible the accept() method won't be called on these new elements (it will depend on the implementation of the accept method). Or if the visitor moves an element to another place in the same document it's again possible that the accept() method will never get called  etc etc. If you have any suggestions about how these traversing problems could be solved for mutable structures, please share them with us :) regards, Maarten Mike Skells wrote:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] XPath.booleanValueOf</header>
    <body>Would it be possible for boolean org.jaxen.XPath.booleanValueOf(Object node) to be exposed through org.dom4j.XPath? Looking at the code it seems like it'd be simple enough: Am I missing something? If not, it'd be quite nice for such an addition to make it in. Ben Scarlet</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] bug in serialization</header>
    <body>Hi guys, several times I faced this issue on my portal dedicated to linux users. People asked for help about PPPD and they entered what they saw on screen. Including code, that is not XML friendly like "&amp;amp;#c" I set it as with element.setText() and serialize it to string and save to database. But when the cache is flushed, the code reads it from database and tries to reconstruct XML from string. And it fails, because that sequence looks like escape sequence. org.dom4j.DocumentException: Error on line 21 of document : Character reference "&amp;amp;#c" is an invalid XML character. It seems, that Dom4J 1.4 doesn't detect this and blindly copies it to string during serialization. How to avoid it? When it happens, portal is dead until I manually find it in database and remove it. Thanks for ideas/fix Have a nice weekend! Leos</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] [Solution] Re: createCopy() and clone() do not work with my custom DocumentFactory</header>
    <body>For those that may run into this problem in the future, possibly I can save them a bit of the grief I went through in figuring this out. I turns out that the implementation of clone() is different in AbstractElement than it is in DefaultElement. In DefaultElement the behaviour of both clone() and createCopy() are indeed a deep copy. However, in AbstractElement the behaviour of clone(), and therefore createCopy(), is a shalllow copy. The fix I employed was simply to copy the code from DefaultElement up to my base element class. This behaviour is not as per the API documentation which clearly states that AbstractElement .createCopy() is a deep copy. Further that API does not even document that clone() is implemented by  AbstractElement. It would be helpful if either the implementation could be changed or at least clearly document the differences in behaviour.

Actually, I was looking for something to do databinding. I'd like this xml structure: automatically be (un)marshalled into a Person bean. I know JAXB does that, but goes out of memory with large files. So I wanted to use the great dom4j 'prune', together with one of the 'data binding' factories:  The DataTypeDocumentFactory only seems to support standard XSD types, but not custom datatypes? (e.g. PersonType) The BeanDocumentFactory on the other hand is capable of using other datatypes (like javax.swing.JFrame in the sample), but this factory is limited to only attributes (no child elements) and requires the classname to be inside the xml document. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, I would need a combination of both factories.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] createCopy() and clone() do not work with my custom DocumentFactory</header>
    <body>Hi, I posted this problem on the user's list and have not had a reply. My apologies for posting it again here, but this is really rather a show stopper for me. I have created a custom DocumentFactory implementation to support my application's model. All works fine except for when I try to use either createCopy() or clone(). Essentially I just get the original element returned. I guess I am missing something. What do I need to do either in my DocumentFactory class or my model classes to get the proper support for these methods? Btw, are there any reference material, examples or how-to on creating and using a custom DocumentFactory to implement custom classes? By the way thanks a lot for the great system. I have been using dom4j extensively for the past three years and this is first support request I have made. That says an awful lot the both the quality of dom4j and the thoughtfulness of the api. Cheers, Joel</body>

    <body>Hi Joel, I may have to code my own DocumentFactory as well in the near future, so I'm interested in your problem, but don't have an answer for you. Can you tell us which interfaces you've implemented yourself, such as Element, Document, etc? You might compare your own implementations to the code found in the AbstractXXX and DefaultXXX classes. There are also a varierty of other implementations that I've looked at in the past for some insight. The cross-reference pages are great for easy browsing:  best of luck, christian.

The true purpose of my costome classes are to implement application specific behaviour. It all works out beautifully except for my createCopy/clone problems. Hope that helps you some. - joel</body>

    <body>Have you overloaded isReadOnly() at all? If so, then the clone() method will simply return itself, which seems to be the problem you're having:  Many of the createCopy() methods seem to depend on clone(), so this might be your problem. christian.

    <body>Paul, I've committed a new XMLWriter class to CVS to solve your issue. I hope it's finally fixed now, could you check it out? If it still doesn't work as expected, could you provide some additional junit tests that illustrate the possible problem(s)? thanks, Maarten On Fri, 4 Jun 2004, Paul Libbrecht wrote:</body>

Since all we want to do here is only synchronize updates to the cache, a more complex synchronization object can be used to allow unlimited number of readers, but only one writer.  Also the new synchronization object will not allow readers while a writer has the lock. Attached is a patch which includes a new file util/ReadWriteLock.java, which is the synchronization object to control readers and writers.  The patch also includes updates to tree/NamespaceCache.java to use this new class. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2004-06-04 10:41 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Added some improvements to CVS code thanks Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

However, in AbstractElement the behaviour of both clone() and createCopy() are a shalllow copy. This behaviour is not as per the API documentation which clearly states that AbstractElement.createCopy() is a deep copy. Further that API does not even document that clone() is implemented by AbstractElement. It would be helpful if either the implementation could be changed or at least clearly document the differences in behaviour. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <body>The dom4j team is pleased to announce the dom4j 1.5-rc1 release!  Changes in this version include: New Features: o Added method to Element to retrieve all Namespaces for a given URI. Thanks to Thomas Diesler. o Added a booleanValueOf(Object node) method to XPath. Thanks to Ben Scarlet. Fixed bugs: o Added the namespace-prefix of attributes to the paths returned by Attribute.getPath(Element context) and Attribute.getUniquePath(Element context). Thanks to Aaron Bell. o Element.declaredNamespaces() now only returns the namespaces that are declared on that element. Element.additionalNamespaces() now only returns namespaces that are declared on that element and is not the same as the namespace of that element. Thanks to Marc Pellmann. o Escape the values of internal DTD entity declarations when serializing to XML. Thanks to Marc Pellmann. o Fixed bug in AbstractElement causing Node.getPath(Element context) to return an absolute path, even if a the current element was the same as the context element. The relative path "." is now returned. Thanks to Rob Grzywinski. o Fixed bug in DOMReader causing namespace declarations to get lost in some situations. Thanks to Thomas Diesler. o Fixed bug in BeanElement which prevented proper execution of the bean samples. Thanks to Wonne Keysers. o Fixed bug in SAXReader that caused problems parsing files in OSX. Thanks to Paul Libbrecht. o Fixed bug in XMLWriter that caused whitespace to be added between successive calls of the characters(...) method. Thanks to Paul Libbrecht. Changes: o Added the GNU JAXP DOM implementation to the default list of implementations in DOMWriter. o Added method to ElementStack and DispatchHandler to check if a handler is registered for a given path. Thanks to Wonne Keysers. o ElementStack is now a public class. Thanks to Wonne Keysers. o SAXContentHandler.endElement(...) can now throw SAXException. Thanks to Wonne Keysers. o STAXEventWriter now uses XMLEventConsumer instead of XMLEventWriter. Thanks to Christian Niles. o Improved performance of NamespaceCache in multithreaded environments. Thanks to Brett Finnell. Removed features: o Removed the DocumentHelper.parseText(String xml, String encoding) method that was introduced in dom4j-1.5-beta2. Have fun! -The dom4j team</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] 1.5 vs 1.4 questions</header>
    <body>Hi, I just discovered an issue with dom4j 1.4 which I've been using in production for a good while.  Apparently when reading a document from disk like this one ... ... And then writing it back out again with XMLWriter and the standard pretty-print formatter, the &amp;amp;amp; entity is just wiped clean.  No trace of it in the document on disk.  If I don't set an output format, the problem doesn't occur.  I wasn't able to tell from the bug fix list- did someone specifically fix this in 1.5?  It does *appear* to be fixed but I wanted to make sure. Also, is there a build target in the ant script that will build a 1.4 style jar, that includes Jaxen and Dom4j in the same jar? Thanks- it is very good to see active maintenance on this project.</body>

Help plz! ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2004-08-22 14:40 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Hi Larry, 1. The reason the SAXReader can't resolve the URI is that you didn't specify a systemID in your InputSource. If you use dom4j, you don't have to create the InputSource yourself, but you can use one of these methods below which create the InputSource for you: org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(File) org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(InputStream, String) org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(Reader, String) org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(URL) Please use one of these methods for creating your Document. If you use the read(File) or read(URL) method, the DTD has to be located in the same directory as your XML document. If you use the other methods, you'll have to provide the systemID yourself. 2. The reason that your EntityResolver is not used is hard to say if you don't provide your source code. However, some SAX Parser don't use the EntityResolver in some situations, even if you have specified one. Perhaps you can try to use the Xerces XML parser, which is behaving correctly in this situation. You can do this like this: org.dom4j.io.SAXReader reader = new org.dom4j.io.SAXReader Did this solve your problems? regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] [ dom4j-Bugs-1004163 ] using a different DocumentFactory</header>
    <body>Bugs item #1004163, was opened at 2004-08-05 14:46 Message generated for change (Tracker Item Submitted) made by Item Submitter You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Ashutosh Aman (ashutoshaman) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: using a different DocumentFactory Initial Comment: Its not exactly a bug. I am using a Factory of Factory pattern to integrate various XML models available in the market, which will give flexibility to the user to switch between different models, depending on the requirement, by changing the document factory system property. In this regard, I tried to set the System property to a different Document Factory (in the case of Dom4j, I extended the dom4j DocumentFactory and implemented the inhouse Factory: someFactory interface). I wanted to leverage the singleton framework of the DocumentFactory, but it did not work as getInnstance casts the object to a DocumentFactory and returns a DocumentFactory. I had to duplicate the work of making the extended factory a singleton class as I could not leverage the existing DocumentFactory getInstance() method. will it make sense to to provide two flavors of getInstance methods, second one would return an Object, so that extened classes can reuse it.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] New release 0.14 of NeuClear XMLSig library offers higher speed verification</header>
    <body>We are happy to announce the latest release 0.14 of the NeuClear XML Signature library The NeuClear XML Signature library is written in Java and was written not for completeness but rather to provide a secure fast implementation of the most common features used in ecommerce, Identity and web services applications. This latest version brings much increased speed in XML parsing, which is particularly good news for web services. It also brings full compatibility with the latest JDK5 from Sun. We use Dom4J 1.5 and the latest XPP3 MXP1 for xml parsing/processing. This is most likely the last release before version 1.0. We hope to add a new high speed low memory verifier for web services usage as well as built in support for the SAML authentication standard. If your organization is interested in sponsoring any of these developments please contact me. NeuClear XMLSig is released as open source software under the business friendly LGPL license. Download the latest release here:  BTW. I am currently looking for consulting/employment oportunities working with XML Signatures. If you or your company are interested or you know anyone that might be please let me know. Regards Pelle Braendgaard --</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] XPP3 support</header>
    <body>I noticed that Dom4J 1.5 has support for the XPP2 parser. The developers of that are now recommending the XPP3 parser  claim is even faster. So I hacked together a XPP3Reader based on James XPPReader. This should live i org.dom4j.io It seems to work fine. I changed to use this with 1.5 in the latest version of my XMLSignature library ( releasing today or tomorrow. So far I haven't noticed any problems and I've seen huge speed improvements on the old SaxReader. I hacked up a completely unscientific comparison on my aging 700MHz P3 This verifies the signature of a very short xml document held in a String, which was signed with a RSA Private Key. 1000 iterations using SaxReader:     70,726 ms 1000 iterations using XPP3Reader: 53,642 ms That is a pretty big difference. In particular when you take in to account that the RSA Sig verification eats up a big chunk of the above time. I haven't done any real pure xml benchmarks but I'm guessing you'll see a huge difference. Please add the code below in CVS if you guys want it. -P --</body>

I just did a jdom integration for an xpointer framework.  It was a snap to use the Attribute.getAttributeType() method to identify when an attribute conveyed ID-ness.  JDOM also got this right both for validating and non-validaing parsers for the internal subset (both MUST report the ID-ness) and for validating parsers for the external subset (a non-validating parser MAY report ID- ness specified in the external subset, but a validating parser MUST report it).

    <body>Bugs item #898545, was opened at 2004-02-17 03:23 Message generated for change (Comment added) made by thompsonbry You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 7 Submitted By: Bryan Thompson (thompsonbry) Assigned to: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Summary: elementByID does not use DTD-determined ID Initial Comment: The current elementByID implementation (dom4j-1.4) does not use information from the grammar to identify attributes of type "ID".  Instead, based on an examination of the unit test, it appears that it looks up an element having an attribute named "ID".  If you look at the test case document, you will see that it does not even include a DOCTYPE or XML Schema, so there is no way to identify which attributes are of type "ID". Therefore the method should fail to return an element for the current unit test. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2004-09-02 10:03 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=916039 Hello, I just downloaded dom4j-1.5-rc1 in order to test the elementByID() support.  Unfortunately, this feature is still broken.  Examination of the testing harness and the XML test document reveals that the tests do NOT test correctly for this feature. ID-ness is conveyed by a DTD that identifies an attribute as having type "ID".  The XML test document and the test harness are assuming that the name of the ID-type attribute is "ID".  This test should be corrected so that elementByID() will correctly show up as a broken feature in the dom4j test suite. Thanks, -bryan ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bryan Thompson (thompsonbry) Date: 2004-02-19 06:44 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=916039 The attached code provided a workaround for our application (an XPointer Framework implementation).  Note that this code MUST provide caching for the AttributeDecls in order to have any decent response time for multiple queries.  Also, if the Document is not read-only, then you have to worry about updates made to the DocType through the dom4j interface. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <body>Bugs item #1020177, was opened at 2004-09-01 06:47 Message generated for change (Comment added) made by maartenc You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: dion gillard (diongillard) Summary: XMLWriter doesn't respect setEscapeText Initial Comment: We have a test case in Jelly that is failing with 1.5-rc1 because the XMLWriter.setEscapeText(false) is still escaping text for CDATA sections. This worked fine in beta-2, but fails in rc1. The jelly test case is in src/test/org/apache/commons/jelly/core/TestFileTag.java if anyone's interested. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2004-09-01 21:39 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Fixed in CVS!

    <header>[dom4j-dev] [ANN] dom4j 1.5.1 has been released !</header>
    <body>The dom4j team is pleased to announce the dom4j 1.5.1 maintenance release! You can find a download link on Changes in this version include: New Features: o Added support for the XPP3 parser. Thanks to Pelle Braendgaard. Fixed bugs: o Fixed problem where the namespace prefix was lost using DOMDocument. Thanks to Ara Vartanian. o Fixed bug in Document.asXML() which ignored the encoding of the document. Thanks to David Karlsen. o Fixed a bug in XMLWriter where a NullPointerException was thrown if trying to write a CData section containing null content. Thanks to Daniel Hopper. Changes: o Updated NamespaceCache to use WeakReferences to allow Namespace objects to be garbage collected. o Updated JAXBReader to allow ElementHandlers to be notified when the specified path is encountered, without having to unmarshall XML content. Thanks to Wonne Keysers. o Modified the internal Aelfred2 parser to no longer support the SAX2 Extensions 1.1 API. As a result, the SAX2 sources are no longer included with dom4j. Have fun! -The dom4j team</body>

If the ClassLoader is thrown away (e.g. if a webapp is reloaded), then the ThreadLocal stuff hold until the Thread dies, which might take a while in a Servlet container where the Threads are pooled.  In such situation, DOM4J would prevent the webapp's ClassLoader to be garbage collected, which would creates a a memory leak and eventually an OOM if the webapp is reloaded too many times. To fix the problem, the use of ThreadLocal could be avoided completly by using thread-safe singleton instead.  There's three places it's used.  There's the getInstance() method from DOMDocumentFactory and DocumentFactory.  In that situation, it doesn't seem an appropriate use to me.  First, the DOM spec doesn't mandate for that implementation to be thread safe, and anyway returning a different instance per thread is no help there, each instance can still be used in different threads.  And you would usually expect a getInstance() method to always return the same object. Also, DOMDocumentFactory already seems perfectly thread safe. The last use of ThreadLocal I identified is in QName, basically for ThreadLocal caching, which doesn't really seem needed, QNameCache seems thread-safe as far as I can see, unless the content of the HashMaps are not meant to be shared by differents calls to DocumentFactory?  But anyway, I don't really thing it would too hard to get rid of the ThreadLocal there.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

However, DOM4J must maintain its thread safety.  There are several users that have demonstrated that need in the past and it would not be wise to remove the implied requirement since it currently is thread-safe. The problem is a contextual one.  A more elaborate caching algorithm will be required to avoid the potential memory leak.  Something in the neighborhood of clearing the cache of things not recently used or even clear it periodically based on time since last cache cleared. A ThreadLocal cache does provide some benefits by avoiding synchronization between multiple threads.  The fix for this bug should maintain equal performance or better while maintaining thread safety. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <body>Bugs item #1070309, was opened at 2004-11-20 23:38 Message generated for change (Comment added) made by gpoirier You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Guillaume Poirier (gpoirier) Assigned to: David Lucas (ddlucas) Summary: ThreadLocal cache Initial Comment: There's a problem with the use of ThreadLocals for caching, it's never cleaned up.  If the ClassLoader is thrown away (e.g. if a webapp is reloaded), then the ThreadLocal stuff hold until the Thread dies, which might take a while in a Servlet container where the Threads are pooled.  In such situation, DOM4J would prevent the webapp's ClassLoader to be garbage collected, which would creates a a memory leak and eventually an OOM if the webapp is reloaded too many times. To fix the problem, the use of ThreadLocal could be avoided completly by using thread-safe singleton instead.  There's three places it's used.  There's the getInstance() method from DOMDocumentFactory and DocumentFactory.  In that situation, it doesn't seem an appropriate use to me.  First, the DOM spec doesn't mandate for that implementation to be thread safe, and anyway returning a different instance per thread is no help there, each instance can still be used in different threads.  And you would usually expect a getInstance() method to always return the same object. Also, DOMDocumentFactory already seems perfectly thread safe. The last use of ThreadLocal I identified is in QName, basically for ThreadLocal caching, which doesn't really seem needed, QNameCache seems thread-safe as far as I can see, unless the content of the HashMaps are not meant to be shared by differents calls to DocumentFactory?  But anyway, I don't really thing it would too hard to get rid of the ThreadLocal there.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2004-11-21 11:20 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=942521 The thing is, that code would be thread safe even without the use of ThreadLocal.  It doesn't provice any benifit, the only place that it might allow to avoid synchronization is in QNameCache for the HashMap, but they ARE synchronized anyway.  And in that case, if you were to worry about the synchronized HashMap performance, then you can use Doug Lea's ConcurrentHashMap. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: David Lucas (ddlucas) Date: 2004-11-21 03:32 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=633013 This is a limitation of using ThreadLocal for a quick cache. However, DOM4J must maintain its thread safety.  There are several users that have demonstrated that need in the past and it would not be wise to remove the implied requirement since it currently is thread-safe. The problem is a contextual one.  A more elaborate caching algorithm will be required to avoid the potential memory leak.  Something in the neighborhood of clearing the cache of things not recently used or even clear it periodically based on time since last cache cleared. A ThreadLocal cache does provide some benefits by avoiding synchronization between multiple threads.  The fix for this bug should maintain equal performance or better while maintaining thread safety. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

I believe it would be better to keep these caches at the Document level: each Document can have it's own cache of QName/Namespace objects. This would avoid us to write any synchronization code as I don't think dom4j should provide thread-safety at the Document level: it's the responsability of the application to synchronize the access to the *same* Document instance. However, dom4j should be thread-safe accross multiple Document instances. I think this can also improve performance as we don't need any synchronized methods anymore to manage the access to these caches. In addition, it could solve some of the problems we have now with respect to the Namespace objects that are shared by multiple document instances.

Different usage scenarios have different needs. I'd suggest that we make the caching strategy a configurable feature, somehow. Perhaps an abstract CachingStrategy class that has methods to produce a QNameCache and NamespaceCache, given a Document and/or a DocumentFactory (some implementations will not use the arguments). Having a static setter for the CachingStrategy in QName and/or Namespace would allow use to change the caching strategy setting programatically; the default choice could be based on a system property. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2004-11-22 20:13 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I think we should get rid of these (singleton) caches.

It is most likely that the same problem also exists in other environments... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2004-11-22 20:14 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Probably the same issue as [ 1070309 ] ThreadLocal cache ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Wonne Keysers (wonnekeysers) Date: 2004-10-11 15:42 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=505480 The Namespace is still holding reference to the NamespaceCache via its static final cache variable. Can it be that that is the problem? Because there is still no improvement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2004-10-09 13:51 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Wonne, I've changed the NamespaceCache to use WeakReferences holding the NameSpace objects. Could you give it a try and let me know what the effect is? I've planned to remove this whole caching in a dom4j 2.0 release... thanks Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <body>Ok, it looks as if SF took the zip just fine. If it is acceptable, I'll g= o ahead and add in the license footer and the copyright header for the so= urce files before someone commits them if you want. I can also add in som= e other minor support features (comments and processing instructions) bef= ore a commit as well. - Robert Thursday, November 18, 2004 1:08 AM To: Robert McIntosh &amp;lt;robert.mcintosh@...&amp;gt;, dom4j-dev@...= eforge.net cc: = Subject: Re: [dom4j-dev] XUpdate update Hi Robert, it would be great if you could create a feature request on SF and upload = the zip file over there.

    <body>Robert, I had a very quick look into it and I'd like more explanations. =46rom what I understand, the normal pattern of usage if the following: - use the xupdate's document-factory (fine, sure!) - use, then, the XUpdateGenerator as an undo-stack Correct ? It should be in the packages.html then! Little remarks: - the author of XUpdateChangeAware is left to the Eclipse default! - any reason you don't write an interface for listeners to your change=20= ? These generic EventListener seem quite unappropriate to me. What's missing of the XUpdate mutations for your implementation to be=20 complete ? How can I apply an XUpdate-document for the changes to happen ? thanks! paul Le 18 nov. 04, =E0 16:33, Robert McIntosh a =E9crit : the=20</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] GNU JAXP license violation</header>
    <body>dom4j appears to be in violation of the GNUJAXP License unless it has special permission from the FSF. Does it? Specifically the latest release of dom4j (and probably earlier releases) has taken the code from GNU JAXP, *modified it*, and incorporated it into its code base which is published under a BSD license. They are not merely linking to the GPL code as permitted by the GPL with library exception. The modifications are probably not major. The only one I know of is changing the package name to org.dom4j.aelfred and org.dom4j.aelfred2 instead of gnu.jaxp.aelfred/gnu.jaxp.aelfred2 though there may be others. I suspect the problem might be able to be cured by linking to the unmodified gnujaxp.jar instead of incorporating the Gnu code directly in the dom4j code base. -- Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...

    <body>On Nov 4, 2004, at 5:15 AM, Elliotte Harold wrote: It may be, but since it is being brought up, it looks as if the GNU JAXP project is in violation of the Aelfred license as well.  See below. After looking at the code, the package names are org.dom4j.io.[aelfred|aelfred2], just to be correct.  Upon first look, the package org.dom4j.io.aelfred package looks as if it just a straight copy of the Aelfred code, which is not under the GPL, so that looks fine. The package org.dom4j.io.aelfred2, however contains the GPL headers in the code, so it looks as if dom4j is in violation.  However, I would also say that the GNU JAXP project is in violation of the orignal license, as the changes made are not 'clearly documented'.  Refer to the aelfred license, and the sentence stating: "You are free to modify AElfred for your own use and // to redistribute AElfred with your modifications, provided that the // modifications are clearly documented." Are there any changes?  If there are, dom4j is in violation as well as GNU JAXP.  If there are no changes, then dom4j may just import the original non-GPL sources, and there are no violations. Viewing the cvsweb for GNU JAXP, it seems that there are some changes. Scott Sanders</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] property changes and XUpdate</header>
    <body>I will soon be starting on an application that will use XML natively as the domain data instead of java beans, and one requirement that I would like to have is to send XUpdate statements to the server for data manipulation. To achieve this I've been looking through the source code quite a bit and I'm pretty sure about how to extend Dom4J to enable property change style events, which a listener would use to build the XUpdate statement to send to the server. Unless someone already has this implemented in some way, I will probably start on this fairly soon and wanted to two things. First would you be interested in my contributing this back to dom4j for possible inclusion, and two, any thoughts or hints as to what this should look like. My initial thought was to create an implementation that wrapped the default implementation but at the Element (or Node?) level intercept changes and fire off the events. Then create a base listener that took the whole document as an argument and based on the events could return back another Document instance (which of course could be serialized) that represented the XUpdates. Thoughts? - Robert</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] property changes and XUpdate</header>
    <body>gee, that doesn't sound small ! Do you have an implementation of XUpdate mutations ? I'd be looking for one on dom4j or jdom ! XUpdate has been implemented within such things as dbxml2, xindice,=20 exists but I know no good standalone implement. (the xupdate web-pages=20= mention two which are much incomplete, I think XUpdate itself is=20 somewhat drifting). As for an XML-in-memory-tree firing events, it looks like there's DOM=20 events fired by Xerces DOM at least. Scott Howlett has been using this=20= for XWing to implement GUI components with XML models... maybe this=20 goes in your direction ? paul Le 5 nov. 04, =E0 16:19, Robert McIntosh a =E9crit :</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] coding conventions dom4j sources</header>
    <body>Hi all, I'm busy with creating a checkstyle configuration for the dom4j sources. It will be based on the SUN coding conventions, but with some modifications to the SUN configuration that comes with checkstyle becasue there were more than 25000 errors. I already have reformatted all sourcefiles with jalopy which reduced the number of errors a lot, but didn't commit anything yet. At the moment, I 'only' have 1036 errors left and I expect to finish the initial code reformatting by the end of next week If someone has any objection or questions against this code reformatting, let me know before I commit the changes... regards, Maarten</body>

CVS HEAD wasn't working for me without that patch though, so it must have been a more recent change since I filed this bug? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-01-30 03:47 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Hi Brett, I've added your test case to CVS. I didn't apply the patch though because I think bug 1077692 was caused by some other error in the Stylesheet class, which has been corrected now. thanks, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] [ dom4j-Support Requests-1111630 ] Reserialization Of Document When Transferred Over HTTP</header>
    <body>Support Requests item #1111630, was opened at 2005-01-28 11:25 Message generated for change (Tracker Item Submitted) made by Item Submitter You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Status: Open Priority: 5 Submitted By: Jubilee (prideafrica) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: Reserialization Of Document When Transferred Over HTTP Initial Comment: I have an XML file created by other editors and saved in a directory on a server. A servlet is supposed to read this file as a dom4j Document and serialize it to an applet that may want to modify the file, the resubmit the modifed XML file for saving. The problem is that when the Document arrives at the applet, its use throws a "java.io.InvalidClassException: org.dom4j.QName; local class incompatible" exception. Why is my file's serial UID changing when the the file is transfered as a serial stream? And how can I lock down this long so edits and various modifications of the file do not change this UID? When I use Xalan/Xerces to do the same thing, everything works fine, which would point to the DOM4J classes as a problem. (As the only troubleshooting step taken). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] [ dom4j-Bugs-1111539 ] Entities munged when serializing DOM to file</header>
    <body>Bugs item #1111539, was opened at 2005-01-28 08:06 Message generated for change (Tracker Item Submitted) made by Item Submitter You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: Entities munged when serializing DOM to file Initial Comment: We're reading a DOM in from an input file; the file contains XHTML entities such as &amp;amp;nbsp; , &amp;amp;amp , etc. After we serialize the DOM to another file, the output file contains the entities in a rendered fashion.  E.g. &amp;amp;nbsp; gets replaced with the actual space, etc. We believe the serialization should preserve the representation the same way it's specified in the input file, or there should be an option to have the serialization render the entities or not. We're attaching a simple Java tester class as well as the input and output files. Please let us know if there are any workarounds.

I was doing some evaluation on dom4j as a replacement for Xerces, and using the org.w3c.dom interface support.  Everything seems to be working so far - retrofitting it into an application that I'm working on.  But I'm having trouble with calling to domDocument.cloneNode(true).  The XML being used contains namespace attributes in the root element (ex: xmlns:xyz="some URL")  This results in an IllegalAddException being thrown for when it tries to clone a DOMNamespace node.  Here's the interesting part of the stack trace:  "org.dom4j.dom.DOMNamespace@...

Instead it just returns the node itself from the clone.  Not set up to debug, but I'm assuming that this node is in fact readonly.  Is there something special to do to make cloning work with an XML that has namespace attributes, or is it a bug?

The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 18:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 15:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed.

    <body>Bugs item #1070309, was opened at 2004-11-21 04:38 Message generated for change (Comment added) made by robcos You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Guillaume Poirier (gpoirier) Assigned to: David Lucas (ddlucas) Summary: ThreadLocal cache Initial Comment: There's a problem with the use of ThreadLocals for caching, it's never cleaned up.  If the ClassLoader is thrown away (e.g. if a webapp is reloaded), then the ThreadLocal stuff hold until the Thread dies, which might take a while in a Servlet container where the Threads are pooled.  In such situation, DOM4J would prevent the webapp's ClassLoader to be garbage collected, which would creates a a memory leak and eventually an OOM if the webapp is reloaded too many times. To fix the problem, the use of ThreadLocal could be avoided completly by using thread-safe singleton instead.  There's three places it's used.  There's the getInstance() method from DOMDocumentFactory and DocumentFactory.  In that situation, it doesn't seem an appropriate use to me.  First, the DOM spec doesn't mandate for that implementation to be thread safe, and anyway returning a different instance per thread is no help there, each instance can still be used in different threads.  And you would usually expect a getInstance() method to always return the same object. Also, DOMDocumentFactory already seems perfectly thread safe. The last use of ThreadLocal I identified is in QName, basically for ThreadLocal caching, which doesn't really seem needed, QNameCache seems thread-safe as far as I can see, unless the content of the HashMaps are not meant to be shared by differents calls to DocumentFactory?  But anyway, I don't really thing it would too hard to get rid of the ThreadLocal there.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Roberto Cosenza (robcos) Date: 2005-02-09 15:30 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=765045 I would like to "vote" for this bug. It is pretty annoying that a webapp will never be garbage collected  . Almost every webapp today needs kind of xml support, where dom4j is pretty unavoidable. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Jan Dvorak (jdvorak) Date: 2004-11-23 08:41 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=22470 It looks like there are many suggestions what to do with QName and Namespace caching: ranging from a singleton cache to dropping caching altogether, with the current ThreadLocal being a valid choice still. Different usage scenarios have different needs. I'd suggest that we make the caching strategy a configurable feature, somehow. Perhaps an abstract CachingStrategy class that has methods to produce a QNameCache and NamespaceCache, given a Document and/or a DocumentFactory (some implementations will not use the arguments). Having a static setter for the CachingStrategy in QName and/or Namespace would allow use to change the caching strategy setting programatically; the default choice could be based on a system property. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2004-11-22 19:13 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I think we should get rid of these (singleton) caches. I believe it would be better to keep these caches at the Document level: each Document can have it's own cache of QName/Namespace objects. This would avoid us to write any synchronization code as I don't think dom4j should provide thread-safety at the Document level: it's the responsability of the application to synchronize the access to the *same* Document instance. However, dom4j should be thread-safe accross multiple Document instances. I think this can also improve performance as we don't need any synchronized methods anymore to manage the access to these caches. In addition, it could solve some of the problems we have now with respect to the Namespace objects that are shared by multiple document instances. Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Guillaume Poirier (gpoirier) Date: 2004-11-22 03:43 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=942521 Oh, and by the way, I checked out the source code from CVS, I removed the ThreadLocals, and all the tests were still sucesful, including one named ThreadingTest. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Guillaume Poirier (gpoirier) Date: 2004-11-22 03:41 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=942521 Well, I admit I might have missed something, but when I said it would be thread safe, I was including concurrent modification of state causing stale or corrupted data, and I still don't see where it would happen. In QName, I don't see any state that can be modified once it has been put in the HashMap.  In QNameCache, the only potential negative effect of concurrent access that I can see is if two requests are made for the same name/Namespace at the same time, then one would get kicked out of the HashMap.  But it doesn't really seem to matter, because I can only see entries added in the cache, nothing is ever removed.  Am I missing something, what shared state is modified? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: David Lucas (ddlucas) Date: 2004-11-22 00:56 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=633013 One of the issues we ran into in the past was not thread-safety but "thread hot" protection.  The problem is when two seperate threads modify data and the state changes during an operation.  It is like a race condition, but the issues can be very dangerous between threads.  That was one of the drivers to have a seperate cache per thread.  It was not the best solution at the time, but was a solution that resolved the issue without over complicating what already existed.  I will look into cleaning up the cache and removing ThreadLocal / Singleton caches where it makes sense. Thanks for bringing this issue back into the light.  We are hoping to address this before the next release. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Guillaume Poirier (gpoirier) Date: 2004-11-21 16:20 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=942521 The thing is, that code would be thread safe even without the use of ThreadLocal.  It doesn't provice any benifit, the only place that it might allow to avoid synchronization is in QNameCache for the HashMap, but they ARE synchronized anyway.  And in that case, if you were to worry about the synchronized HashMap performance, then you can use Doug Lea's ConcurrentHashMap. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: David Lucas (ddlucas) Date: 2004-11-21 08:32 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=633013 This is a limitation of using ThreadLocal for a quick cache. However, DOM4J must maintain its thread safety.  There are several users that have demonstrated that need in the past and it would not be wise to remove the implied requirement since it currently is thread-safe. The problem is a contextual one.  A more elaborate caching algorithm will be required to avoid the potential memory leak.  Something in the neighborhood of clearing the cache of things not recently used or even clear it periodically based on time since last cache cleared. A ThreadLocal cache does provide some benefits by avoiding synchronization between multiple threads.  The fix for this bug should maintain equal performance or better while maintaining thread safety. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <body>Hi all, is this a bug or a feature? After setContent, the parent of c is null?! If it is a bug, an easy patch in DefaultElement.setContent would be to call contentRemoved() before all other stuff. This doesn't seem to break other tests, but I am not familiar enough with the dom4j-sources to evaluate other possible side-effects. Please take a look at the attached patch. cheers Pete</body>

Initial Comment: The equals method on the Namespace object only returns true when the namespace uri and prefix are the same. (same for hashCode()) This causes problems for times when the namespace needs to be prefix unaware (this is preferred behavior), like when using the DatatypeDocumentFactory. Note: Changing this in the Namespace can probably not without changing the namespace caching mechanism at the same time. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

From the error message it *looks* like a disconnect between Java 1.3 and 1.4, but Jaxen shouldn't have any such dependence and I can't find one in these classes at the moment. The error message is correct. XPath 1.0 does not allow unions of booleans. This has been tightened up in Jaxen in the recent past. Jaxen used to allow this, but that was a mistake. Jaxen no longer allows this. -- Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@... XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] [announcement] dom4j 1.6 released!</header>
    <body>The dom4j team is pleased to announce the dom4j 1.6 release!  dom4j: the flexible XML framework for Java Changes in this version include: New Features: o Added a methods to SAXReader allowing to specify the encoding used when reading XML sources. Thanks to Filip Jirsak. o Added a setXMLEncoding(String) method to the Document interface. o Added a SingletonStrategy class for managing singletons. This allows to use different strategies for singletons, like: one instance per VM, one instance per thread, ... This change removed the usage of ThreadLocals. Fixed bugs: o Removed a static OutputFormat field from AbstractBranch. This can cause problems if multiple threads are using the asXML() method simultaniously. Thanks to John Plaxton. o Fixed a whitespace problem with the pretty-print OutputFormat. Thanks to Brett Porter. o Fixed a bug in the DefaultElement.setContent(List) method that caused incorrectly resetting the parent of the nodes in the list. Thanks to Peter Schaefer. o Fixed a problem in AbstractDocument.asXML() when an encoding was specified on the Document. Thanks to Pieter Valcke. o The DefaultNamespace.isReadOnly() method now returns false. This fixes issues with cloning this Node. o Fixed a bug in Stylesheet when an xpath expressions was used to select the nodes. Thanks to Brett Porter. Changes: o Changed the DocumentHelper.parseText(String) method to make sure that the XML encoding is always set (if known) on the returned Document, even if the used SAXParser doesn't provide a way to retrieve that encoding. o Modified SAXEventRecorder to accomodate sax events generated when writing a DOMDocument. o Updated DocumentFactory to create the instance untill the first time it is needed. Thanks to Brian Topping. Removed features: o Removed persistence package and sub-package. Have fun! -The dom4j team</body>

Therefore this seems to be a bug, please correct me if i am wrong. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Thanks eclipse :-) Now it may compile under JDK 5.0. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2005-04-03 16:43 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1175071 There are some new interfaces in JDK 5.0 (for example org.w3c.dom.TypeInfo). It is probably related to DOM Level 3. We can test presence of this class when building jar. When this class is present, we can patch source in build directory. But Ant's patch task depends on external patch, which is not present everywhere (yes, my Windows station didn't have it). So there should be patched files prepared in distribution archive. So I have added two new tasks in build.xml: "patch-for-jdk5" patches source files and store them into "src/jdk50". This should be run before creating distribution package. (I expect patch "jdk50.patch" in "src/patch directory"). Second task "prepare-jdk5" is conditional (it is executed only when org.w3c.dom.TypeInfo is available). It overwrites files in build dir with patched version. The task "prepare-src" newly depends on "prepare-jdk5". Patch for build.xml is attached. I can't test task "patch-for-jdk50", because I have not patch on my workstation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-04-02 23:18 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 If I apply your patch, dom4j won't compile anymore under JDK 1.4 !

    <body>Hi I am working as software developer in a company can any one send me the details regarding dom4j and its' advantage over java-xml. -sathish</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] reg dom4j</header>
    <body>From the dom4j FAQ ( DOM is a quite large language independent API. dom4j is a simpler, lightweight API which is optimised for the Java making extensive use of the Java 2 platform such as the Java 2 collections. Though dom4j fully supports the DOM standard allowing both APIs to be used easily together. Basically it's easier to use and more Java-friendly than the standard API (because the standard API  follows the W3C spec, which wasn't written with Java in mind). b PS: Hey website maintainer... looks like that FAQ page needs some proofreading: "...optimised for the Java..."? Also, starting the second sentence with "Though" is awkward. sathish kumar wrote:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] JAXP Schema validation</header>
    <body>I am trying to get the parser dom4j is using to validate an XML document with an XML schema. The parser is Xerces 2.6.2 (result is the same with it on the classpath or with Java 5 on its own). If I do this: reader.setFeature(" etc it validates fine, and reports any errors. If I do this: reader.setProperty(" " it doesn't report any errors. If I set that property directly on JAXP, or via setProperty on jdom or the commons-digester, then Xerces correctly reports the errors. If I construct the parser myself from JAXP, set that property on it, and pass it to dom4j, it also reports errors. Has anyone else experienced this ? Could someone point me in the right direction ? Thanks in advance, Graham King. PS: The reason I would like to get the second string working is that it is parser independent, whereas the first string will only work with Xerces.</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Problem parsing from URL</header>
    <body>Hi, In my java code, i am trying to read the web page from a url. The url points to a linux directory containing some xml files. In short, i am trying to read the directory via url, for further processing. I use the following code : The url is initialized to I get the error  "org.dom4j.DocumentException:Error on line 11 of document  referenced, but not declared. The entity "nbsp" was referenced, but not declared." Of course "nbsp" is used inside the page source. But the page is automatically generated by apache tomcat upon accessing the url. How to handle this problem. Should i use some other parser. - I also successfully read the same page (line by line) by java.io.BufferedReader method. But to futher parse it by dom4j the root element is inaccessible (it has null value). Thanks for your help. Regards, Shuaib</body>

    <header>RE: [dom4j-dev] dom4j 1.x and dom4j 2.0</header>
    <body>Hi Maarten, I would like to open a discussion on the purpose/features for 2.0 For instance what will be the minimum supported JDK Are we going to support generics, enums annotations .... Also - are you /we intending to support new features, for instance does the current implementation block so new wizzy feature that you really want/need to implement What is the timescale for the new version When 2.0 gets produced, how long will 1.x be taken forward. ---- Personally I would like to target 5.0 + and backport via retroweaver or something similar if needed, but I don't want to start a flame war (just yet) I may be able to provide some time to help in the activity. We currently use dom4j heavily in some products, so I would be particularly interested in adding some features, to enable extended behavior to not be implementation dependent, and in increasing the performance.

Subject: [dom4j-dev] dom4j 1.x and dom4j 2.0 Hi, I've started with the dom4j 2.0 development. The biggest change will be a major refactoring of the current implementation and a new project structure. This will hopefully make a. the sources better maintainable b. it easier to write new extensions I will try to keep the dom4j interfaces as much backwards compatible as possible, but some changes will probably break this backwards compatibility. Because I think this can take a while, I've created a branch in CVS so we can work further on a 1.7 release of dom4j. If you want to commit something for this 1.7 release, make sure you do it in the DOM4J_1_X_BRANCH, otherwise it won't be included in the 1.7 release regards, Maarten ------------------------------------------------------- This SF.Net email is sponsored by: NEC IT Guy Games.

Using the recent release (2.1.10) one gets compile errors in the org/dom4j/xpp/ProxyXmlStartTag.java class due to API changes in the 2.1.9 release of XPP2. Relevant section from changelog: removeAttributes * added to XmlStartTag two new methods: removeAttributeByName(String uri, String localName) and removeAttributeByRawName(String rawName) Please update to the current XPP2 version in your next release ! Attached a (maybe wrong) implementation of the second change. The first should be obvious :-) But be aware I am not a XML guru and it may be wrong (don't know the exact meaning of rawname). Please CC me on comments or changes to these two methods, as I am not subscribed.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] FW: PSVI (xml schema) support in dom4j</header>
    <body>Hi, I have been working on a small contribution that supports the Post Schema Validation Infoset in dom4j  I am happy to contribute this code, I have tested it with Apache Xerces 2.6.2 only, but I would appreciate some discussion :- about the best way to package this support? should it be part of the DOM4j behaviors? (SAXReader, BaseElement)  The changes are are simple, but a little cludgy, as I could see a way of doing what I needed within the existing io features.  Outstanding issues demo forces JAXP, and makes some assumptions that may not hold true for SAX implementations other than apache. Should there be a PSVIProvider property for instance, should the we use inheritance, as the demo uses element and attribute creation to allow for the PSVI details to be detailed. I initially tried to use the dispatch handler, but this is package level class, as is ElementStack etc, hence the packaging in dom4j.io of features that can be set. I don't know if there are standard features, and the appropriate sets of options that will support other implementations  The demo requires the a.xml and a.xsd file to be in top of the C drive. (Any non windows users will have to modifythe code in the Text.java) There is a demo file Test.java, which can be executed, and prints out the content of the annotation in the xsd, accessed via PSVI  I would appreciate any comments  [Mike Skells] I can sent the files but zips are being blocked from the list. I can send then directly to anyone who is interested, orif someone can tell me of the appropriate mechanism to package the file I will adopt that   Mike</body>

This would be not problem, if trimText=true never touches the value of tags, only removing whitespaces and similar stuff between tags. source:  my expected result of trimtext:  Of course dont change the current default behaviour, just add an option, that allows the user to decide, if he wants also the content of tags should be trimmed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2005-05-05 15:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 It should be fixed in CVS now, could you try again with the latest sources from the DOM4J_1_X_BRANCH branch? thanks Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Thomas Fromm (tfromm) Date: 2005-04-26 17:10 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=79402 Its possible, that you can fix trimText for 1.5.x in the same way as implemented in 1.6, because i'am not able to update to 1.6 (jaxen xpath problems and dom4j need stuff from the actual jaxen). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Thomas Fromm (tfromm) Date: 2005-04-21 08:51 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=79402      ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-04-20 21:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Could you given me some example code I can execute that illustrates your problem? thanks, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Thomas Fromm (tfromm) Date: 2005-04-13 11:34 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=79402 Sorry, had wrong test results.

A servlet is supposed to read this file as a dom4j Document and serialize it to an applet that may want to modify the file, the resubmit the modifed XML file for saving. The problem is that when the Document arrives at the applet, its use throws a "java.io.InvalidClassException: org.dom4j.QName; local class incompatible" exception. Why is my file's serial UID changing when the the file is transfered as a serial stream? And how can I lock down this long so edits and various modifications of the file do not change this UID? When I use Xalan/Xerces to do the same thing, everything works fine, which would point to the DOM4J classes as a problem. (As the only troubleshooting step taken). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2005-05-06 12:02 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I think the problem is that your applet uses another version of dom4j than your servlet. could you verify this? regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] dom4j 1.x and dom4j 2.0</header>
    <body>Hi, I've started with the dom4j 2.0 development. The biggest change will be a major refactoring of the current implementation and a new project structure. This will hopefully make a. the sources better maintainable b. it easier to write new extensions I will try to keep the dom4j interfaces as much backwards compatible as possible, but some changes will probably break this backwards compatibility. Because I think this can take a while, I've created a branch in CVS so we can work further on a 1.7 release of dom4j. If you want to commit something for this 1.7 release, make sure you do it in the DOM4J_1_X_BRANCH, otherwise it won't be included in the 1.7 release regards, Maarten</body>

    <body>Bugs item #1194977, was opened at 2005-05-04 06:55 Message generated for change (Comment added) made by maartenc You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Gili Tzabari (cowwoc) Assigned to: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Summary: Always include nested exceptions Initial Comment: When I invoke element.selectNodes() it invokes Jaxen under the hood and if Jaxen fails for any reason it returns: org.dom4j.InvalidXPathException: Invalid XPath but this is incorrect because if the underlying implementation encounters a totally unrelated issue such as ClassNotFoundException (as I get in my case) then it is completely swallowed up by dom4j and it gives a misleading message. For this reason, please never swallow nested exceptions. At the very least, please fix the Jaxen issue I mention above. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2005-05-05 15:39 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Yes, there could be some hours delay on the public CVS servers ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Gili Tzabari (cowwoc) Date: 2005-05-05 15:17 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=80628 CVS complains there is no such branch/tag.

    <body>Bugs item #1193537, was opened at 2005-05-01 16:24 Message generated for change (Tracker Item Submitted) made by Item Submitter You can respond by visiting:  Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: duplicate namespaces output in XMLWriter Initial Comment: When using SAXWriter to output a SAX stream from TRaX, SAXWriter outputs duplicate namespaces. This appears to be because the namespaces appear in the SAX stream both as prefix mappings and as attributes. (I think the dual-representation of namespaces also ocurrs when the SAX namespace-prefix feature is enabled in the SAX parser.) The test case below highlights the problem, and the XMLWriter.patch is one possible fix.

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Chandu Natarajan (cnatar) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: BettXpath generation through AbstractElement.getUniquePath() Initial Comment: Currently, the getUniquePath() when applied to Node or Element objects generates a 'short form'  xpath that for namespace-prefixed nodes includes the prefix for example /xsd:schema/xsd:element. This generated xpath when applied, for instance within an XSLT transform (such as saxon etc) does not work because the XSLT processor is unable to associate the correct namespace uri with the 'xsd' prefix. In order to resolve this problem and various other issues related to locating namespaced nodes via dom4j generated xpath, I propose the attached fix. The attachment shows the difference in the org.dom4j.tree.AbstractElement class in the method getXPathNameStep(). Basically the last return statement should be changed from return getQualifiedName();  to return "*[local-name()='" + This will generate a more generic xpath that will work across different XSLT and XPATH processors and will always locate the correct node. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Problem in Dom4j's Maven POM on ibiblio</header>
    <body>Hi there, There is currently a problem in the Dom4j's POM published on ibiblio. They reference the stax API using an artifactid of "stax". It should be "stax-api". This causes problems when using Maven2 as it supports transitive dependencies. See We are fixing it in the Maven repo for now. Could you fix it in the sources so that the next release has it right? Thanks a lot -Vincent</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Illegal XML character &amp;amp;#x1e;</header>
    <body>Hello, I'd like to reiterate my old report about bug in serialization. I have upgraded to 1.6 but it happens again and again. Sometimes I cannot open XML document, it fails, that String serialized with DOM4J is not valid, because it contains invalid XML character. Portion of XML: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt;teepee pcmcia # cardctl status Socket 0: teepee pcmcia # cat /dev/tts/4 it was generated with: Then I attempted to read it via: but it throws: Caused by: org.dom4j.DocumentException: The problematic character is "&amp;amp;#30;", xmllint complaints this way: parser error : xmlParseCharRef: invalid xmlChar value 30 I don't know, how the original input looked like. I cannot simulate it manually, I just have to fix it several times per month. I guess that these invalid entities may be some strange unicode characters .. Any idea, how to avoid this? Thanks Leos</body>

    <body>I was asked by a number of people offline to let them know the results of this - so I'm just sending an email back out to all. The bottom line is basically there is no simple/obvious way to do this. I have no idea why they spec'ed it this way but the node "/root" in xpath is root with no namespace - not root with the default namespace. So aside from contortions like the one below - you can't have a node suing the default namespace in an xpath statement. As to why it was designed this way - no idea. - dave David Thielen 303-499-2544  -----Original Message----- From: David D.

These files contain entities as for non-breacking-spaces as for some national charackters (german 'umlauts'). If it was used XMLWriter with format, configured to trim text ( 'setTrimText(true)' ), then after each entity it is added a blank charackter. So, solid words containing entities instead of true national charackters become to be splitted, what is _very_ bad for xhtml. If format is initialized NOT to trim text ( 'setTrimText(false)' ), blank charackters are not inserted. I do not really know if it is a bug or feature, but, it is very anoying...

There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-14 04:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-13 05:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation.

The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out.

Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 13:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected.

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Kohsuke Kawaguchi (kkawa) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: Bug in org.dom4j.rule.Mode.getMatchingRule Initial Comment: According to XPath data model, there's no distinction of CDATA nodes and Text nodes --- they should both match "text()" equally. However, the current getMatchingRule() method is written in such a way that CDATA nodes don't match rules written for Text nodes. Adding the following code: between CDATA and ordinary text at line 176 fixes this problem. This problem causes Maven1 xdoc plugin to ignore CDATA sections in xdoc files.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] performance improvements for SAXReader</header>
    <body>Hi , I have been profiling an application that parses many thousand, ver small xml documents.  I have noticed that the impl,entation of the SAXReader consumes more CPU and generates more garbage form the initialisation of the XMLReader and the ContentHandler that it takes in the parsing  some small modifications to the SAXreader so that the XMLReader and ContentHandler are not is not re-initialised, yealded a four times less garbage and 3 fold less CPU usage  I am happy to contribute the changes if anyone is interested  profiling was from jprobe, against dom4j 1.6.1, xerces 2.7.1 and java 1.4.2  Mike</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Steve Carter (cart33) Assigned to: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Summary: Problem with XPath and retrieving text Initial Comment: I have a Junit test similar to the following: which fails because getText() only returns: Water T interrogating the node object returned from selectSingleNode indicates that the expected result is present as 3 seperate text elements in the content (ArrayList) member variable I can retrieve the value if I tweak the approach to use:  If i dont have entity references then the first approach always works. Therefore this seems to be a bug, please correct me if i am wrong. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Victor (kromo) Date: 2006-02-22 01:55 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1156663 I encountered the same problem. In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 13:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 14:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 14:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-14 04:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-13 05:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 16:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 15:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 18:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Therefore this seems to be a bug, please correct me if i am wrong. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2006-03-24 23:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Bazza, I've modified SAXContentHandler to also merge the CDATA sections if you set mergeAdjacantText to true. Could you please try again with the version from CVS? (branch DOM4J_1_X_BRANCH) thanks Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Victor (kromo) Date: 2006-02-22 01:55 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1156663 I encountered the same problem. In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 13:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 14:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 14:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-14 04:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-13 05:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 16:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 15:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 18:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

There can be surprising repercussions in some XSLT transformations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Category: None Group: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Kohsuke Kawaguchi (kkawa) Summary: Bug in org.dom4j.rule.Mode.getMatchingRule Initial Comment: According to XPath data model, there's no distinction of CDATA nodes and Text nodes --- they should both match "text()" equally. However, the current getMatchingRule() method is written in such a way that CDATA nodes don't match rules written for Text nodes. Adding the following code: between CDATA and ordinary text at line 176 fixes this problem. This problem causes Maven1 xdoc plugin to ignore CDATA sections in xdoc files. So please consider applying this patch. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date: 2006-03-21 22:49 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Applied slightly modified patch in CVS.

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too.

There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight.

The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out.

This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

The detach() causes the BackedList to not find elements properly any longer and to cause this exception when the add occurs in BackedList on line 79: (realIndex will always be -1). This behavior should actually work, but does not. In addition, you get this confusing error message since the index is not -1 and the size is not 12 (the branch list is larger than just the element list). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] parseText &amp;amp; XMLSignatures</header>
    <body>Hello, I am using the following code to render a org.w3c.dom.Element to a string of XML for storage and then back to an org.w3c.dom.Element object. This seems to be working pretty well except for the XMLSignature Node of the Element. It seems that I am losing characters from the XMLSignature during the conversion. It appears as though this is related to \n characters in the SignatureValue. Any ideas for troubleshooting this problem are greatly appreciated. Thanks! -Garett =20 Here is the initial SignatureValue as it appears in JSwat: "\ndcBfthahGpsAy55Ftk8mXWZozozHxLztBXahpSG6YkXEJ&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;UAWliQIoAUrlyoBKGP6 CLhAY\naGogDWCdYNLQDrbYEmI=3D\n" =20 Then this line of code converts the Element into a stringwriter: domreader.read((Document)assertion_element.getOwnerDocument()).write(str =20 I pasted the relevant portion of the buffer of the stringwriter as it appears in JSwat at the bottom of the email.

The reason the SAXReader can't resolve the URI is that you didn't specify a systemID in your InputSource. If you use dom4j, you don't have to create the InputSource yourself, but you can use one of these methods below which create the InputSource for you: org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(File) org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(InputStream, String) org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(Reader, String) org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(URL) Please use one of these methods for creating your Document. If you use the read(File) or read(URL) method, the DTD has to be located in the same directory as your XML document. If you use the other methods, you'll have to provide the systemID yourself. 2. The reason that your EntityResolver is not used is hard to say if you don't provide your source code. However, some SAX Parser don't use the EntityResolver in some situations, even if you have specified one. Perhaps you can try to use the Xerces XML parser, which is behaving correctly in this situation. You can do this like this: org.dom4j.io.SAXReader reader = new org.dom4j.io.SAXReader Did this solve your problems? regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Basically... it means that relative resolution is *not possible* for files and it also mean, for some weird reasons, to me, that encoding are handled wrong. I am doing this experience with the maven xdoc plugin 1.9.2 and with jelly 1.1-SNAPSHOT and jelly xml-taglib 1.2-SNAPSHOT. I would like to suggest two alternatives: - consider that the "#" that could be in the file-name should probably be URL-encoded (and do so if file.toURL() doesn't which seems to be the case) - or at least only use the FileInputStream alternative if there is such a "#" and only then. I could provide patches and tests... later... thanks paul ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: James Strachan (jstrachan) Date: 2003-02-12 10:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=65291 Fixed by Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2003-02-12 01:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 Fixed in CVS ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

This particular namespaceURI =3D null before serialization to string/parsing to Element.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Bringing dom4j up-to-date</header>
    <body>Hello folks, I have recently posted to this list asking if dom4j is still =20 maintained. Unfortunately it is not actively maintained at the =20 moment, due to a lack of time from the main developers. This has =20 resulted in the facts that dom4j currently API that warnings when traditional amount A friendly Sourceforge-user by name of Stefan Haustein (SF-ID: =20 haustein) has provided a patch offering a remedy to both of the above =20= problems by implementing the new W3C API as a dummy that throws =20 exceptions and by making the external dom4j API using generics. The =20 patch seems to work very fine and all the test-cases included with =20 dom4j run without a problem after applying it. However, Eclipse still has a lot to say about the dom4j sourcecode: =20 approximately 1000 warnings including: I volunteered to do a code clean-up to remove these problems. Maarten =20= is interested in this work and has kindly given me access to the =20 developer CVS and so I started looking at further details of the =20 project. I noticed a few things that I would like to discuss with you =20= before I start any work. =3D=3D Freezing 1.6.1 =3D=3D There doesn't seem to be a CVS tag for dom4j 1.6.1 yet (the last tag =20 was for 1.4.1). In any case I suggest that the last release should be =20= tagged in CVS. That would then remain the official release for Java 1.4. =3D=3D Towards a new unstable release =3D=3D After that, I would suggest that 1.6.1 (which has been stable for =20 over a year now) remains the preferred version for Java 1.4 and that =20 the next release is targeted at Java 1.5. (Mike Skells has mentioned =20 in a previous mail that even Java 1.5 projects can be integrated in a =20= Java 1.4 environment using retroweaver ( retroweaver.sourceforge.net/)) I suggest to aim only for an unstable release at the moment, as I =20 don't see anybody implementing the new W3C DOM API. So a new release =20 would only feature a cleaned up code, Java 1.5 support and possibly =20 modernized build environment (see below). But hey, I think that's =20 much better then doing nothing. =3D=3D CVS -&amp;gt; Subversion =3D=3D Additionally I would personally like to switch the project over from =20 cvs to subversion. I have worked for a while on another Sourceforge =20 Project using CVS and there was often one or the other problem with =20 it, including that the devel CVS and anonymous CVS were not in sync, =20 that CVS got broken because some locks were not cleaned up, etc. =20 Essentially it's probably a matter of taste and my taste is in favour =20= of Subversion, because it's simply easier to use (uses http/https, no =20= need to manually tag binary files, etc) =3D=3D Maven and friends =3D=3D There is a Maven 1.x project file in CVS along with some friends such =20= as files for  Checkstyle, Jalopy and GUMP. Maven 2 pom.xml. Checkstyle produces? 1.5. Is that a =3D=3D Dependencies =3D=3D Time has moved on outside dom4j as well and there are updated =20 versions of the dom4j's dependencies: a stax-api 1.0 tries to use the I didn't check all the dependencies yet. What is the general opinion: if dom4j runs readily available I'm personally for in favour of a) because I like to work in an up-to-=20= date environment.

    <body>Hello, allow me my 2p here... "supporting java 1.5" would not be a matter of dom4j 1.5 it would be a full change in API, I think. The same topic has been discussed on the jdom mailing list, which relies a bit more on collections and most have said... well... maybe... but we need to support both. There are still folks, such as me, which wouldn't be *able* to run jdk 1.5. On the Mac, it means an OS upgrade, and I fear it's the same on others. paul Maarten Coene wrote:</body>

    <body>Hi Paul, I see the problem, yet I believe that 1.6.1 is quite a stable release of dom4j for those platforms and people that can't run Java 1.5. Additionally dom4j does not seem to be under active development. So would you see a problem in freezing 1.6.1 as a stable branch allowing only for potential bugfixes and start moving HEAD to Java 1.5, which would mean that after a long time some work is put into the project again?

    <header>[dom4j-dev] dom4j can add explicit namespace node for the implicit
	xml namespace</header>
    <body>Hi, while using DomDocumemtFacties I noticed that a namespace for the implicit xml namespace was being added, when the document was formatted.  Some XML parsers are unable/unwilling to parse a document with xmlns:xml namespace declatation. I seem to remember that the namespaces starting with xml and implicit.  The following code demonstrates the issue --- --- The issue seems to occur due to the code in XMLWriter, for the detection of a namespace declaration --- ---- the comparison is equality on XML_NAMESPACE should be .equals, not == as other namespace nodes can be created and present in the structures, whether generated automatically,as in this example, or programatically, so the comparisong could be This will cause the element field of the DefaultNamespace to be taken into account, which is not relevent, so this could be converted to check the prefix and the uri, but this is what the namespace stack does isnt it? Would the better solution be to push the XML_NAMESPACE into the namespace stack when the NO_NAMESPACE is pushed, in the constructors for the NamespaceStack, as half of the exclusion logic is in the XMLWriter and half in the  NamespaceStack, and the encapsulation is IMHO compromised  The DomDocumentFactory subclasses the standard namespace, as to comply with the w3c Node interface, is has additional methods. At any rate the user may create a namespace directly, rather that going through the cache, so the same situation may occur in other types of trees Are there any more implicit namespaces that need special handling, and omission from the serialised form?

The logical thing for dom4j to do here is to reset the default namespace for the child. I recommend you keep a predefined set of QName instances around for all your tags and attributes, with properly set namespaces and prefixes. Note that if you set a default namespace manually and then add a element using a QName instance that has the same namespace URI as the default namespace, but has a non-"" prefix set, dom4j will bind the namespace to this prefix. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2006-10-12 11:47 Message: Logged In: NO No one answer? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too.

The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Submitted By: Victor (kromo) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: SAXContentHandler.characters() is buggy Initial Comment: First, the parameters of this method are named "ch", "start" and "end". "end is misleading it should be renamed to "count". Second, the line should be changed to avoiding additional objects is what "StringBuffer" is for. IMHO the "mergeAdjacentText" approach is buggy since  says the it "...may return all contiguous character data in a single chunk, or they may split it into several chunks." Which means that dom4j will unknowingly create multiple text nodes even if there is only one in the source XML, because of the implementation of "org.xml.sax.XMLReader " delivering large texts as chunks or buffer boundaries for smaller texts. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation.

The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out.

    <body>Hi richard et al, +1 from me I use SVN for all our projects and this is one of the last 2 CVS project that I work on Jaxen 1.2 is nearly out I believe This has my vote I think that we should also conconsider any API chnages that the community need to enable the use of dom4j to be improved. For example, A few thinks that I would like to see ... For me I would like to see the DocumentFactory as accessable from a Node (or at least the elements and attributes if the rest is an issue). It is there is you know how to look for it but it is a side effect rather than by intent I would like the DocumentFactory to be an interface I would like Element to include Apis for getElement(int), getElementCount() and a few others Similarly I would like to see mechanisms to allow readonly and copy lists of content to be available efficiently I would like to use events when operations occur on a node (I have a product that provides workflow based on retrofitting this facility into DOM4J) Some of the above are simple and probably dont ruffle too many feathers, but I am sure that some people will want to flame me (please resist). I believe that we should use this oppertunity  to fill any holes that the community see need to be filled to simplify use and extension Mike</body>

You folk know much more about the inner workings of dom4j than I do, so I'm not going to try and give qualified comments here. I intend collect some of that knowledge during the clean-up of warnings and putting in generics - which can be done largely with minimally invasive changes (and so do little harm) but during which I have to visit almost every part of the code. What I keep thinking about is if it makes sense to intern() all element names and attribute names etc. or install something like a global node-type cache to reduce the memory footprint. I didn't check yet if there is a global node-type cache. I believe I saw one for namespaces. Cheers, Richard</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Bringing dom4j up-to-date</header>
    <body>There are existing options, cant remember of the top of my head what, that allow /encourage the saxreader to intern the references. This does not use the String.intern() method, but interns the name/values internally (no pun intended). Clearly this only covers the XML that is read via a SAXReader If we are to cover the issue where the XML is created via other means, the major problem that I can see with interning is the implementation in the SUN JVM. From my understanding of the JVM the String.intern() places the string into a global pool that is not subject to GC until the String.class is unloaded (which never happens), and you can get OutOfMemoryException when the stack  and heap still have plenty of space. I forget what memory block the intern() method uses. If someone is more familiar with the issues then please update this If there is any interning to do then this would seem to be a policy issue that could be controlled via a delegate, such as a setting on the DocumentFactory. That way interning could be customised to provide the appropriate setting for an application, for examples no interning String.intern() Map based interning LRU based such as LinkedHashMap Weak or Soft reference based interning custom interning There is a cache for qNames - which include the eleemnt and attribute names but if you dont use the factory methods then this can be bypassed. For the node type cache - not sure what you mean here - is this a cache of all of the attribute with a specific name/value, for example. If so this can be done already, with some simple extensions to the DocumentFactory to cache and re-use attribute/text etc using the ReadOnlyAttribute etc, but this does limit the functionallity as they are not mutable, and in some situations Xpath can be significantly slower</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Bringing dom4j up-to-date</header>
    <body>Isn't this just an alternate DocumentFactory implementation? Or is there something in the current object model preventing you from doing this effectively? I seem to remember there being some good reason this couldn't happen originally, but even if this isn't the case, I'd posit you can't do this now because it'll break backwards compatibility. at=3D121642</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Bringing dom4j up-to-date</header>
    <body>This is an alternate DocumentFactory the uses much of the underlying infrastructure in Dom4j, but providees transactional services and event notification, and a rule model, however as the underlying implementation does not provide much event support, the implementation is overly sensitive to the implementation. If the implementation provided better event support the two issue could be managed cleanly, without depending on the quirks of the implementation  I fully agree that this is incompatable, however - there are ways to preserve the compatability by introducing, for example a parent interface - any changes to any interface will provide compatability issues, some affecting users, and some affecting implementation</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] CSS4J 0.4.0 available for testing</header>
    <body>A few days ago, I released version 0.4.0 of the CSS4J project. CSS4J is a BSD-licensed implementation of the W3C CSS Object Model API, providing such support to the DOM4J API (limited support for "official" XML DOM is also present). The home page for the project is: and the Release Notes at: Please read the Javadoc summaries to see how the API can be used. The synopsis of its use is the following: Then, you can retrieve the body elements and do: And finally, if you want to get the full power of CSS4J, use a "style database" according to the target device (two are provided, one for Java2D and another for iText). This would set a style database for Java2D: With a style database you can use at full the CSS4J's CSS2ComputedProperties interface, which is more handy for Java than the W3C API. For example: Do not forget that this is still a 0.4.0 version: test it, and if you find a bug please notify me. Hope you find the code useful. Regards, Carlos Amengual</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Andre Nurzenski (nurzensa) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: ClassCastException while creating org.dom4j.DocumentFactory Initial Comment: I am using dom4j 1.6.1 within an OSGi-Bundle in a rich client application. When running the application, the following call causes a DocumentException: The DocumentException contains a nested ClassCastException: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.dom4j.DocumentFactory at org.dom4j.DocumentFactory.getInstance(DocumentFactory.java:97) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.getDocumentFactory(SAXReader.java:645) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.createContentHandler(SAXReader.java:969) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(SAXReader.java:449) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(SAXReader.java:343) The cause of this exception seems to be the way the DocumentFactory class is loaded in org.dom4j.util.SimpleSingleton, line 38, using the context class loader. When using Class.forName() to load the class (same way as in 1.6), the problem does not occur. As this seems to be a very special problem within an OSGi-Environment and its class loading mechanism, I'm not sure if this issue can be considered as a bug.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Update</header>
    <body>Hello folks, I already wanted to have started my work on dom4j, however, me schedule did not permit me yet to do so. I just wanted to inform you that I have not given up on the plans I had, just I will have to delay them onto the coming year. Btw. I have noticed that dom4j 1.6.1 was indeed tagged in CVS, I just didn't see it because extracting the CVS tags with Eclipse is a little different from seeing tags in Eclipse's Subversion Plugin (which I am used to) ;) So, I already with a happy christmas and happy new year to everybody, as I'll be off for two weeks now. See you 2007. Cheers Richard</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: Document.selectNodes() returning NULL Objects Initial Comment: Our application uses Dom4j 1.4 for Unmarshalling XMLs into Java objects. Until recently, we used Sun JVM for Java 1.4.2_06. But since we moved to JRockIt JVM R26-4.0 for Java 1.5.0_06, we are facing this problem with Dom4j 1.4. We unmarshall the objects while booting the application and store them in memory (this is because, the objects are accessed very frequently). Initially, everything will be fine and all the unmarshalled Document objects will be behaving perfectly. But, some time later, while the application is still running, we start exepriencing problem with these Document objects, which are stored in memory. The selectNodes() method will return a list will NULLs. Which results in NullPointerException in the execution. Please let me know a similar cases have occured before and upgrading to Dom4j 1.6.1 will solve this problem. Thanks. -Nagendra ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation.

The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out.

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not.

I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not.

Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions.

In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too.

There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation.

The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out.

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

The logical thing for dom4j to do here is to reset the default namespace for the child. I recommend you keep a predefined set of QName instances around for all your tags and attributes, with properly set namespaces and prefixes. Note that if you set a default namespace manually and then add a element using a QName instance that has the same namespace URI as the default namespace, but has a non-"" prefix set, dom4j will bind the namespace to this prefix. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2006-10-12 02:47 Message: Logged In: NO No one answer? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Steve Carter (cart33) Assigned to: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Summary: Problem with XPath and retrieving text Initial Comment: I have a Junit test similar to the following: which fails because getText() only returns: Water T interrogating the node object returned from selectSingleNode indicates that the expected result is present as 3 seperate text elements in the content (ArrayList) member variable I can retrieve the value if I tweak the approach to use:  If i dont have entity references then the first approach always works. Therefore this seems to be a bug, please correct me if i am wrong. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2007-02-09 02:58 Message: Logged In: NO The panda checjet foundation is more expensive, that me  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2007-02-09 02:58 Message: Logged In: NO The panda checjet foundation is more expensive, that me  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2007-02-04 01:52 Message: Logged In: NO Plaxis Ent.

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 04:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected. The spec says that adjacent Text nodes should be merged automatically. Thus the normalize() call is a workaround (but at least, it should work). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 05:25 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 Hi, I think this is perfectly normal. There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 19:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.  Second, the xpath spec says that 'text()' should select all text nodes.  I'm not sure if dom4j is "at fault", but it sure would be nice if it could at least be resilient to the problem. :-) Andrew. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Steve Carter (cart33) Date: 2005-02-12 20:06 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=597933 Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciated. I have not made myself familiar with the specification so I appreciate your insight. It  just seemed intuitive to me that selectSingleNode() would return the full value of the node whether references were present or not. Feel free to close this issue and pursue it as an enhancement as there are many approaches to satisfy the solution. I enjoy using your api and thanks again for the help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 07:04 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 On the other hand, I see now in the 5.7 of the XPath spec that a text node shouldn't have immediately following siblings that are text nodes themselfs, so this could be a bug indeed. I'll investigate this further... regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Maarten Coene (maartenc) Date: 2005-02-12 06:57 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=178745 I don't think this is a bug. The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 09:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Doing selectNode(...) on this element will start looking for the XPath expression from the root of the document. Consider the following simple example: Element root = reader.read(new File(fileName)) Node n will always be &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;atom01&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;, even when the currently selected element is the 2nd &amp;lt;atomic&amp;gt; with &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; atom02. In fact the call e.selectSingleNode("/repository/atomic/name") is always possiblem, while calling e.selectSingleNode("/atomic/name") returns null. If this is a deliberate behaviour, it should have been stated clearly in the javadoc. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

When using Class.forName() to load the class (same way as in 1.6), the problem does not occur. As this seems to be a very special problem within an OSGi-Environment and its class loading mechanism, I'm not sure if this issue can be considered as a bug. Please contact me if you need further information. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: shakebaby (shakebaby) Date: 2007-08-20 03:56 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1871087 Originator: NO I met this with the same environment.I don't know why.

Just started out of nowhere.  I had installed jdk1.6, then tried to uninstall it and put 1.5 back, and ever since that happened there have been problems.  My code was working before, though, so this is a little frustrating. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 06:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 07:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected.

There are multiple text() children which may be addressed separately with xpaths containing indices (see bug 1374352). Your problem is that selectSingleNode() only selects the first matching text child, and it seems you should call normalize() on the root element first to "merge" adjacent Text nodes before any further processings. regards, Michael Pichler ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-04-13 21:14 Message: Logged In: NO I have just hit this bug (in production of course ;-). Originally using dom4j 1.4, but still present using dom4j 1.5.2, jaxen 1.0FCS. My xpath is of the form "//a/b[text()="value"]/..". This failed in one case because the 'b' element has been parsed into two 'text' nodes. It seems it crossed some buffer boundary in the parsing stage, as the two text values are "TINBICS_SECOND" and "ARY_FEC" (i.e. just normal text). In our other test cases this has been parsed as a single text node. I verified the arbitrary splitting by adding spaces earlier in the file, and the position of the split moved accordingly "TINBICS_SEC" and "ONDARY_FEC". Replacing the xpath with "//a[b="value"]" solved the problem, so this seems to be a problem with using "text()" in the xpath. The xpath spec says there should never be two adjacent text nodes.

The following happened: expression "a/b/text()" selects all text nodes of &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;. Because you have an entity reference in it, the SAX parser you have used did create 3 text nodes: "Water T ", "&amp;amp;" and " D-46816". The selectSingleNode() method returns the first node: "Water T ". So this is correct. expression "a/b" selects all &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. If you apply the string function to it, you will retrieve the string-value of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; element. This expression should do the trick: "string(a/b[1])", as illustrated by the example below: now, result is equal to "Water T &amp;amp; D-46816" Another way is to retrieve the node and ask for the string-value directly on the node: I hope this helped you out. If you still feel this is a bug, please tell me otherwise I'll close this issue. regards, Maarten ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2005-02-10 11:49 Message: Logged In: NO This problem affects other xpath query types sch as /a/b/* etc... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

In my case there were no entities but a buffer boundary which created mismatches. I used something like //serialNumber/text() to collect all serial numbers but one of these was splitted into to separated text() nodes. It makes a big difference eg. if one has something like "count(//serialNumber)" or "count(//serialNumber/text())" because these two number may be not equal even if Buffer boundaries should have no influence on the model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Bazza (bazzargh) Date: 2005-12-22 13:05 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1005507 (came here from a related bug report filed against jaxen, see Maarten, I think there's a legitimate bug here: /any/xpath/text() should only return multiple nodes for mixed content, not just when there are entities present. eg: Should return 2 for count(/a/text()); and with mixed content the stringValue of '/a' is not the same as '/a/text()' (referring to your workaround above) should return 1 for the same expression (going by the xpath spec). Also: Should return 1. People using xpath with dom4j need to use normalize() to work around this whenever node() or text() appear in their expressions. Unfortunately the 'setMergeAdjacentText' method at parse time, which would appear to 'pre-normalize' the tree, doesn't. In SAXContentHandler (copying and pasting from my comments on JAXEN-67 ): inside 'characters()', this code: ... means that even if you've asked it to merge adjacent text nodes, it goes ahead and builds cdata nodes; which it then adds without checking the 'mergeAdjacentText' flag: To my mind, these should read, respectively: ... // you'd want this condition around the code in startCDATA too. This would make 'mergeAdjacentText' normalize as it goes, which I'm guessing was the desired behaviour? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Michael Pichler (mpichler) Date: 2005-12-16 14:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=613551 I stand corrected.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] DocumentHelper.parseText data corruption after &amp;amp;lt;</header>
    <body>After some odd data corruption errors in my app, I tracked it down to dom4j and managed to simplify the error to a short reproducable (with 1.6.1) case.  After enough attributes that include a &amp;amp;gt; or &amp;amp;lt;, dom4j starts to mess up and duplicate parts of the data from one attribute into the value of another. test4="44444 &amp;amp;lt;" test5="55555 &amp;amp;lt;" test6="66666 &amp;amp;lt;" test7="77777 &amp;amp;lt;" test8="88888 &amp;amp;lt;" test9="99999 &amp;amp;lt;" test10="101010101010 &amp;amp;lt;" becomes: test4="44444 &amp;amp;lt;" test5="55555 &amp;amp;lt;" test6="66666 &amp;amp;lt;" test7="88888 when passed through dom4j.  Notice test7 and test 9 are corrupted with some of the value from test8 and test10 respectively.  I've never dug into the dom4j code before, could someone give me a tip on where to look to troubleshout this very weird and destructive error? Test program: public class ParseTest encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Test test1=\"11111 &amp;amp;lt;\" test2=\"22222 &amp;amp;lt;\" test3=\"33333 &amp;amp;lt;\" test4=\"44444 &amp;amp;lt;\" test5=\"55555 &amp;amp;lt;\" test6=\"66666 &amp;amp;lt;\" test7=\"77777 &amp;amp;lt;\" test8=\"88888 &amp;amp;lt;\"</body>

haven't got SAXparser configured properly or you try reading some file you haven't acces to. Try javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory.newInstance().newSAXParser().parse(…) without dom4j. In case this works but access throught dom4j doesn't work, there is problem with dom4j. Otherwise it is problem outside of dom4j. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Namespace.equals() query</header>
    <body>Hi guys,  I've noticed that Namespace.equals() only returns true if the namespace and the prefix are the same - surely this is a bug?  Namespaces are the same irrespective of what prefix the user chooses to use, and could even choose to use two different prefixes in the same XML stream for the same namespace.  Regards, John</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Andre Nurzenski (nurzensa) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: ClassCastException while creating org.dom4j.DocumentFactory Initial Comment: I am using dom4j 1.6.1 within an OSGi-Bundle in a rich client application. When running the application, the following call causes a DocumentException: The DocumentException contains a nested ClassCastException: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.dom4j.DocumentFactory at org.dom4j.DocumentFactory.getInstance(DocumentFactory.java:97) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.getDocumentFactory(SAXReader.java:645) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.createContentHandler(SAXReader.java:969) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(SAXReader.java:449) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(SAXReader.java:343) The cause of this exception seems to be the way the DocumentFactory class is loaded in org.dom4j.util.SimpleSingleton, line 38, using the context class loader. When using Class.forName() to load the class (same way as in 1.6), the problem does not occur. As this seems to be a very special problem within an OSGi-Environment and its class loading mechanism, I'm not sure if this issue can be considered as a bug. Please contact me if you need further information. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Pete (petehak) Date: 2007-12-18 12:58 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1962444 Originator: NO We have run into this same problem with Weblogic Server 10.0, Dom4j 1.6.1 contained in several EAR files. The occurrence of the problem seems quite random. We can test applications for days, and then suddenly this exception is thrown. After a Weblogic reboot, everything works fine, until the problem occurs again after some period of time. We must do something about this. Should we include dom4j in system classpath, change Dom4j's class loading behavior described in this thread (Class.forName..) or what? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: shakebaby (shakebaby) Date: 2007-08-20 05:56 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1871087 Originator: NO I met this with the same environment.I don't know why. I guess it may be a bug . Can any one give me a reply please ? Thank you ! ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Kevin Galligan (kpgalligan) Date: 2007-03-19 02:46 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=102538 Originator: NO I'm having the same problem.  Just started out of nowhere.  I had installed jdk1.6, then tried to uninstall it and put 1.5 back, and ever since that happened there have been problems.  My code was working before, though, so this is a little frustrating. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Andre Nurzenski (nurzensa) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: ClassCastException while creating org.dom4j.DocumentFactory Initial Comment: I am using dom4j 1.6.1 within an OSGi-Bundle in a rich client application. When running the application, the following call causes a DocumentException: The DocumentException contains a nested ClassCastException: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.dom4j.DocumentFactory at org.dom4j.DocumentFactory.getInstance(DocumentFactory.java:97) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.getDocumentFactory(SAXReader.java:645) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.createContentHandler(SAXReader.java:969) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(SAXReader.java:449) at org.dom4j.io.SAXReader.read(SAXReader.java:343) The cause of this exception seems to be the way the DocumentFactory class is loaded in org.dom4j.util.SimpleSingleton, line 38, using the context class loader. When using Class.forName() to load the class (same way as in 1.6), the problem does not occur. As this seems to be a very special problem within an OSGi-Environment and its class loading mechanism, I'm not sure if this issue can be considered as a bug. Please contact me if you need further information. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Filip Jirsák (filipjirsak) Date: 2007-12-18 12:17 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1175071 Originator: NO May be this is bug in dom4j. Though you can pass on DocumentFactory when creating SAXParser – dom4j doesn't need creating its own instance of DocumentFactory with buggy singleton afterwards. You can try this: DocumentFactory should be singleton better, but you can manage it your correct way. For example: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Pete (petehak) Date: 2007-12-18 11:58 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1962444 Originator: NO We have run into this same problem with Weblogic Server 10.0, Dom4j 1.6.1 contained in several EAR files. The occurrence of the problem seems quite random. We can test applications for days, and then suddenly this exception is thrown. After a Weblogic reboot, everything works fine, until the problem occurs again after some period of time. We must do something about this.

Just started out of nowhere.  I had installed jdk1.6, then tried to uninstall it and put 1.5 back, and ever since that happened there have been problems.  My code was working before, though, so this is a little frustrating. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

I removed its internal use of SimpleSingleton and replaced it with static class to store one DocumentFactory instance. Can I use the same DocumentFactory instance for concurrent threads or should there be one DocumentFactory per thread? If that class is not thread-safe, then this fix is not applicable. We have to find some other way, like discarding the caching compleletely and create a new instance of DocumentFactory for each call. This naturally comes with a performance penalty, but how big, i dunno. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Filip Jirsák (filipjirsak) Date: 2007-12-18 13:17 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1175071 Originator: NO May be this is bug in dom4j.

It is trying to connect to the internet to fetch the DTD. It fails. This failure may be because the machine's firewall does not allow Java apps to do this autonomously. So a solution would be to configure the firewall. Or perhaps Java itself or the parser code is not setup to connect to the internet. The reason why I say you are correct, is because if I remove the schema references from the XML document, then I don't get the exception. Also, reading the schema is not required for what I am doing. So rather than remove the schema, there should be a flag or setting to switch off parsing the DTD. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Filip Jirsák (filipjirsak) Date: 2007-12-10 15:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1175071 Originator: NO I think problem is somewhere in SAX parser – probably if you try read the same file directly with SAX, you would obtain the same exception.

It is trying to connect to the internet to fetch the DTD. It fails. This failure may be because the machine's firewall does not allow Java apps to do this autonomously. So a solution would be to configure the firewall. Or perhaps Java itself or the parser code is not setup to connect to the internet. The reason why I say you are correct, is because if I remove the schema references from the XML document, then I don't get the exception. Also, reading the schema is not required for what I am doing. So rather than remove the schema, there should be a flag or setting to switch off parsing the DTD. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Filip Jirsák (filipjirsak) Date: 2007-12-10 16:31 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1175071 Originator: NO I think problem is somewhere in SAX parser – probably if you try read the same file directly with SAX, you would obtain the same exception. Is file.xml some simple file without XML Schema, DTD and so on? May be SAX parser try to read some schema mentioned in file and cannot find them. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

(typically our uniqueName doesn't even have spaces) We use dom4j 1.4 and simply instatiate the document, then pop the attribute ala: Well, looks like somebody strips consecutive blanks so we get "prog 02" the database so we say we can't find it.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Generics Maintenance</header>
    <body>Hello folks, I have done some generification of the codebase. If you are interested, i can do some simple jdk 1.5 maintenance of the project. Importent Step to generify the codebase would be the generification of BackedList to BackedList&amp;lt;L&amp;gt; and perhaps ContentListFacade. The BackedList can then be used with many Types (Element, Namespace, ProcessingInstruction....) There is one mentionable functional change?! The contentList is now List of Nodes. (List&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt;) In the current HEAD-Version are some workarounds to handle Strings in the contentList This Workarounds (Mainly in DefaultElement, DefaultDocument and in AbstractElement isTextOnly()) are removed! The Javadoc of Branch setContent states already, that there could be only set a list of Nodes. All Tests passes before this changes passes after this change. I assume this String Handling Workarounds are all deprecated and can be removed. ConcurrentReaderHashMap can be replaced with java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap. So we can remove other workarounds and doesn't need to generify this Class. If you want the changes, I need access to the CVS. We must do a Branch in the CVS (old Codebase -&amp;gt; Branch 'non_generics' or 'jdk_1_4'...). If you want to see my current Version, I can upload or send you the codebase. I doesn't have a Implementation of the new W3C-DOM Changes. This will be needed for a stable Java 5 release.  Best regards, Daniel</body>

    <body>Hi there, lots of time ago I was quite enthusiastic of helping to get Dom4J to Java 5. Much to my shame I still didn't manage to get something done :( There are already several Java 5 patches on Sourceforge:  In any case I would be very happy if anybody really found the time to working on this. The original developers also seem interested since shortly after I stepped forward saying I want to work on this, I got provided with the necessary write access to the CVS. So, I hope your priorities will not get in your way as mine always do. Good luck! Richard</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] dom4j 2.0</header>
    <body>Hello, I've started work on dom4j 2.0 - compatible with Java 5, generics, enums etc. I'd like to clean code (remove methods marked as deprecated in previous version), use new classes from Java 5 where possible, implement new DOM interfaces and other. Version 2.0 will be notfully backward compatible with 1.6.1 (therefore version 2.0), but in typical program using dom4j there will be no need for change in source code. I switched to Maven 2 build system and Mercurial source code management system. I'd like to revitalize dom4j, release new version 2.0 and maintain it. "Home page" for version 2.0 is temporarily at  and download Mercurial repository packed in tar.bz2. If somebody has some comments, ideas or patches, please send it to dom4j-dev@... mailing list. If nobody is against it, I'd like to change dom4j.sourceforge.net and dom4j.org to homepage of dom4j 2.0 and conserve current pages for 1.6.1 version (for compatibility with Java 1.4). James, Maarten and Bob, do you agree? Is it possible to give me appropriate rights to move dom4j 2.0 to dom4j.sourceforge.net and conserve current pages. My SF account is "filipjirsak" -  I hope stable version of dom4j 2.0 will be released after years of stable 1.6.1. Yours sincerely, Filip Jirsák</body>

If I've a document like below:  [DOC1]  if I want access book elements with xpath expression I should use /myns:books/book and not /myns:books/myns:book (I've used XMLSpy).

If I want to have myns as namespace for all elements, my document should appear as below:  [DOC2]  I mean, should I tag each element with namespace as in [DOC2] or like in [DOC3] there is an equivalent 'short' form ?  [DOC3]  It seems that [DOC2] &amp;amp; [DOC3] are different because /myns:books/myns:book xpath expression is correct for [DOC2] but not for [DOC3].

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Adding XPath support via JAXP</header>
    <body>Hi, First apologies for spamming both lists, but I noticed that the dev list is not used a great deal. I am representing the Eclipse Foundation (EF) in an effort to use dom4j in its full glory within EF projects. The EF is very careful about the IP pedigree of all third party libraries used in EF projects. There is no problem with dom4j itself and in fact it has been approved for reuse for sometime now. The problem is with the XPath support dependency on Jaxen. The EF has tried several times to communicate with the Jaxen team to confirm some IP related issues, but have failed to receive a reply. I have therefore decide that the way forward is to attempt to add JAXP support for the XPath functionality. Would the Dom4J team be willing to co-operate with us in accomplishing this? I do not think it is a matter of replacing Jaxen, but rather to add another means of supporting XPath. A test can then be performed at runtime to determine if Jaxen is available and if not use JAXP if it is. We would very much appreciate any assistance you folks could give us in this matter. All the best, Joel</body>

    <body>Hi, I don't know how deep is Jaxen interlaced in dom4j code. On the other hand I think it is in dom4j intention to afford interfaces which can have different implementations. Dom4j itself has org.dom4j interfaces and org.dom4j.tree, org.dom4j.dom and org.dom4j.bean implementation, so why not use the same principle for XPath? I don't think it is good idea to implement this in 2.0 branch, probably it will be better to wait for 2.1. I plan intensify usage org.dom4j.DocumentFactory to offer QName cache implementation for document instead of one hardcoded cache, I think DocumentFactory should offer XPath implementation in the same way. Than you can use both Jaxen and JAXP in one source code. Looking in JavaDoc it seems there are such methods in DocumentFactory, so it probably means to generalize them only. Probably you know source code repository for dom4j 2.0 is in Mercurial repository welcome :-) Regards Filip Jirsák 2008/10/12 Joel Rosi-Schwartz &amp;lt;Joel.Rosi-Schwartz@...&amp;gt;: -- Filip Jirsák filip@...</body>

    <body>Thanks for the reply Filip. I should have mentioned that we are working against 1.6.1. I am not sure if we are prepared to move to 2.0 because it require a new IP review process. In case we do consider is 2.0 backwards compatible with 1.6.1 except in regards to the removed deprecations? We have limited resource to tackle this modification, so we really have to consider carefully how we move forward with it. If you (or others on the Dom4J team) are prepared to assist us (minimally with guidance and answering questions) then we can consider do a proper job and a patch. Otherwise we will have to do a quick'n'dirty to get us by. Would you be in a position to assist? Many thanks, Joel On 14 Oct 2008, at 09:03, Filip Jirsák wrote:</body>

    <header>Re: [dom4j-dev] Adding XPath support via JAXP</header>
    <body>dom4j 2.0 will as backwards compatible as possible except necessary changes needed by upgrade to Java 5 (generics, W3C DOM 3 etc.) It means no new dependencies and only a little of new code. I don't know what exactly IP review means - if it means license and dependencies review, there will be no change between 1.6.1 and 2.0. In fact I plan update dependecies versions to the most actual ones, but I hope it doesn't matter. By the way, I plan to release maintaince version 1.6.2 with the same dependencies version update - for example dom4j should go with release version of Jaxen instead of beta version. If IP review means code review in respect of algorithms and software patents, there is some new code in LazyList class. I'm afraid I can't help with this in that case, because I live in country where software patents doesn't exists fortunately and I don't know anything about them. I wrote LazyList class myself without help of any other code, but I don't know if it matter. I will try to answer your questions as best I know. Need to say that I'm not the original author of dom4j. I want to revitalize dom4j and I write some code for dom4j 2.0, but source code of dom4j is relativelly new for me. However, I hope that I will be able to help you.

    <body>Hi Filip, On 14 Oct 2008, at 17:48, Filip Jirsák wrote: Apologies, I should have been clearer. The Eclipse Foundation is very concerned that all software that is released by EF project is safe for consumption by its adopters and users. Therefore all third party software is checked for licence and copyright cleanliness. Essentially all the Foundation wants to assure themselves of is that all of the software is under an acceptable OS licence, that it was written by who the third party says it was and that all authors agree (in some controlled fashion) that it is okay for their work to be included in the distribution. It not really onerous :-) and if you take a look at the wide range of third party software that is included in EF projects you will see that it is not hard to pass review. Every new release of library does need to be reviewed. But often is easier on future runs if for no other reason than a relationship has been formed with the authors already. Btw, do you have contact with the Jaxen authors. If so maybe you could encourage them to contact us about this. That is a good question, and I think the EMO IP team would be better placed to comment. Barb? We would appreciate any help you are able to provide. I have not followed the history of Dom4J for some time, but a gather that the original project went dormant and you brought it back to life. Are you in contact with any of the original authors?

    <body>Hi Joel, the build dependencies between 1.6.1 and 2.0 changed in the following way: * Jaxen 1.1-beta-6 -&amp;gt; 1.1.1 * pull-parser 2 -&amp;gt; 2.1.10 * xpp3 1.1.3.3 -&amp;gt; 1.1.4c The test dependencies will probably change more, but perhaps I will remove some dependencies from the list rather than append some new. I have no contact with Jaxen authors, I found solution concerning developer access and domain with Maarten Coene and James Strachan, one the original authors.

    <body>Hello Filip, hello dom4j developers! I have some problems/aspects with dom4j and want to add some code to the project to fix this. The problems are: 1. XPath 2.0 In the Moment there is a fix use of Jaxen in the XPath API. I want to use the XPath implementation of Saxon. To do this I have added JAXP methods to the XPath interface. Then I have implemented this with JAXP. There are now parallel methods for variable and function contexts for JAXP and Jaxen (to not break the interface). May be in the future (dom4j 2.0) it will be an good idea to use only the JAXP interfaces and write Jaxen implementations for them!? 2. Access to all namespaces used by the document for XPathes It is needed to add all namespaces from the document to the xpath, to work correct with namespaces. This also need the ability to add new prefixes for URIs, if there are default namespaces or doubled prefixes. I have added such an class and the access to it in document interface (and the AbstractDocument implementation). The element implementation (AbstractElement) adds namespaces to this object if added to the element. (removing is an aspect, that is not addressed) What is the preferred way for you to add (and update) this code? -- Viele Grüße / best regards Marc Pellmann (Software Architect) inubit - integrating your business and IT inubit AG Schöneberger Ufer 89-91 D-10785 Berlin Fon: +49.30. 72 61 12-132 Fax: +49.30. 72 61 12-100 Freecall: 0800-go inubit Web: Vorstand: Dr. Torsten Schmale Vorsitzender des Aufsichtsrates: Dr. Wolf-Dieter Klemt Registergericht: AG Charlottenburg Registernummer: HRB 80154</body>

    <body>Hi! I do not see this in 1.6.1 but I think it would not be enough if it is there. The xpath expression could be of any complexity and could try to select nodes in all other branches of the document and in deeper of the actual with own namespace declarations, too. And this branches have other namespace declarations and maybe the prefixes would be the same with other URIs or there are default namespaces without prefixes, that need to be changed (added with prefix). There is no method to get all namespaces that are defined in the document. So this is what I have added. In many cases it would be enough to add namespaces unchanged to the xpath expression. But in the situations above it is needed to change prefixes of some namespace definitions that should be added to the context and this is done, too. The xpath need to use this new prefixes - there is no code in the moment to automatically change some pathes, because this might be extreme complex. Again the xpath could be of any complexity.

    <body>Hi Mark, I agree that the implementation does not cope with all of the complexities of possible naming patterns that may be employed, but I would be interested to understand how you expect to maintain the list of namespaces. I regularly handle files of 10M to 100Mb, and modify these documents based on XPath based rules. Scanning the document in this case is not an option, and as namespaces may be removed, and content shared within the document, maintaining a map of usage is not trivial in code, CPU or memory. I would suggest that any code that determines namespace could use a namespace resolution strategy that is appropriate for its needs, and this should be able to be defaulted without code. This is what the DefaultNamespaceContext does, albeit without strategy options, but any progreammer can withthe 1.6.1 implementation provide a different namespace context, appropriate for their needs, and what you are proposing is such an alternative I believe The code for retrieval  is in 1.6.1 see AbstractElement.getNamespaceForPrefix, and DefaultElement.getNamespaceForPrefix Also NamespaceStack. The mechanism for retrieveal is I believe linked in with the Jaxen namespace resolution techniques, as can be seen by an inspection of DefaultNamespaceContext.

    <body>Hi Mike! I do not want to scan the document to build the list of namespaces. The add(Namespace) method of AbstractElement could add each new namespace to the specific new XPathNamespaces object which is declared at the document (in my addition). What is needed is a NamespaceContext (but at best not only for jaxen, but that is an other point) which holds all namespaces that are declared in the document. And what is needed is code to collect this namespaces in creation of the document. The Problem with only add namespaces to the document with add(Namespaces) is in adding of branches. To solve this there might be 1) a more complex strategy to hold namespace declarations for each branch 2) retrieval of all namespaces from the branch while adding 3) add all namespaces of the document of the branch (if it comes from an other document), because more namespaces than needed should not be a problem For me point 3 would be enough.

I do not want to scan the document to build the list of namespaces. The add(Namespace) method of AbstractElement could add each new namespace to the specific new XPathNamespaces object which is declared at the document (in my addition). So how does this cope with structural chnages. An Element and all of the children may be added in a single rearrangement, an element may not have a document when it is being built., and the document may be chnaged after the element is added, or many other different ways to disturb the structure. What is needed is a NamespaceContext (but at best not only for jaxen, but that is an other point) which holds all namespaces that are declared in the document. And what is needed is code to collect this namespaces in creation of the document. Agreed the curren one is tied to Jaxen, and a pluuggable XPath would be a huge improvement The Problem with only add namespaces to the document with add(Namespaces) is in adding of branches. To solve this there might be 1) a more complex strategy to hold namespace declarations for each branch As I am sure youwould agree this would be costly 2) retrieval of all namespaces from the branch while adding As I am sure youwould agree this would also be costly 3) add all namespaces of the document of the branch (if it comes from an other document), because more namespaces than needed should not be a problem For me point 3 would be enough. Surely if there are 10 definitions for a given prefix and 10 prefix definitions for a given namespace and they are all different then that woul be a problem wouldnt it. Dont you have to determine the appropriate namespace mapping and the point of evaluation. How do you determine to correct mapping in context see AbstractElement.getNamespaceForPrefix, and DefaultElement.getNamespaceForPrefix I do not see how this could help?

To solve this there might be 1) a more complex strategy to hold namespace declarations for each branch 2) retrieval of all namespaces from the branch while adding 3) add all namespaces of the document of the branch (if it comes from an other document), because more namespaces than needed should not be a problem For me point 3 would be enough. see AbstractElement.getNamespaceForPrefix, and DefaultElement.getNamespaceForPrefix I do not see how this could help? -- Viele Grüße / best regards Marc Pellmann (Software Architect) inubit - integrating your business and IT inubit AG Schöneberger Ufer 89-91 D-10785 Berlin Fon: +49.30. 72 61 12-132 Fax: +49.30. 72 61 12-100 Freecall: 0800-go inubit Web: Vorstand: Dr. Torsten Schmale Vorsitzender des Aufsichtsrates: Dr. Wolf-Dieter Klemt Registergericht: AG Charlottenburg Registernummer: HRB 80154</body>

    <body>Hi Mike! I agree that this could happen if branches would be build without documents or branches from other documents would be added. But I think there are different scopes of use. And if you want to use full namespaces support for XPathes you need to build your document in order. In addition you always have the chance to add namespaces by yourself to the context if you do some special operations. If we want to support all cases of structure changes and removes it will be really costly. I think this would be overdone. Not really. For an xpath you could use each of them. The point for me is to have the chance to have all namespaces with prefixes that could be needed by an xpath for the given document (or branch). And in most cases you have only the ones from your document and this will be better as for example use all namespaces from the namespace cache wich means the namespaces from all documents that where created since the vm start (and this will result in many problems with doubled prefixes). -- Viele Grüße / best regards Marc Pellmann (Software Architect) inubit - integrating your business and IT inubit AG Schöneberger Ufer 89-91 D-10785 Berlin Fon: +49.30. 72 61 12-132 Fax: +49.30. 72 61 12-100 Freecall: 0800-go inubit Web: Vorstand: Dr. Torsten Schmale Vorsitzender des Aufsichtsrates: Dr. Wolf-Dieter Klemt Registergericht: AG Charlottenburg Registernummer: HRB 80154</body>

    <body>Surely if there are 10 definitions for a given prefix and 10 prefix definitions for a given namespace and they are all different then that woul be a problem wouldnt it. Not really. For an xpath you could use each of them. The point for me is to have the chance to have all namespaces with prefixes that could be needed by an xpath for the given document (or branch). And in most cases you have only the ones from your document and this will be better as for example use all namespaces from the namespace cache wich means the namespaces from all documents that where created since the vm start (and this will result in many problems with doubled prefixes). assuming that you can cope with overlaps, are you proposing to try each combination and see think ones work. That could be a lot of options x:n1/x:n2/x:n3/x:n4 would take 10000 options if x has 10 mapping would it not.

Initial Comment: Hi, I want to add a String as text/content to an Element. If I use the addText() method my String gets escaped, so "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" becomes something like this "&amp;amp;lt;p%gt;..". Oh fine, I have to use addCDATA() method ... no I don't because this would make something like "&amp;lt;![CDATA[...myText...]]&amp;gt;". I just want to add my String as body-content to an element wihout changing the string in whatever way.

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: add Text without escaping or addid cdata section!!? Initial Comment: Hi, I want to add a String as text/content to an Element. If I use the addText() method my String gets escaped, so "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" becomes something like this "&amp;amp;lt;p%gt;..". Oh fine, I have to use addCDATA() method ... no I don't because this would make something like "&amp;lt;![CDATA[...myText...]]&amp;gt;". I just want to add my String as body-content to an element wihout changing the string in whatever way. Is this possible?? using dom4j.1.6.1 regards, chris ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2009-02-25 22:53 Message: Il [URL= href='  eugenio montale [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  [URL= [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  cubismo [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  incontro adulto [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2009-02-25 22:05 Message: Polizia [URL= href='  adolescente [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' palla [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  bimbi robot cucina [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  [URL= [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  [URL= italiano [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  [URL= prefabbricate [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2009-02-25 21:16 Message: Dal [URL= href='  [URL= href='  [URL= href='  corsi on line [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  [URL= href='  [URL= href='  maria swan [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  christina aguilera [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2009-02-25 20:29 Message: Ministro [URL= href='  navigatore gps [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href=' [URL= href='  paris [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  [URL= [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= href='  [URL= [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=' [URL= [URL= href='  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2009-02-25 18:57 Message: Milioni [URL=  medioevo [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  [URL= latino [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  [URL= href='  [URL= href='  [/URL] &amp;lt;a href='  href=' [URL= href='  [URL= ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2009-02-25 17:09 Message: [URL= http href=" http  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2009-02-07 14:27 Message: plkmmj 13182440 te7i9l [URL= insurance [/URL] &amp;lt;a href=" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Filip Jirsák (filipjirsak) Date: 2008-07-09 08:53 Message: Logged In: YES user_id=1175071 Originator: NO No, it is not possible.

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: add Text without escaping or addid cdata section!!? Initial Comment: Hi, I want to add a String as text/content to an Element. If I use the addText() method my String gets escaped, so "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" becomes something like this "&amp;amp;lt;p%gt;..". Oh fine, I have to use addCDATA() method ... no I don't because this would make something like "&amp;lt;![CDATA[...myText...]]&amp;gt;". I just want to add my String as body-content to an element wihout changing the string in whatever way. Is this possible?? using dom4j.1.6.1 regards, chris ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2009-02-26 08:42 Message: Usa

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Matthias (kaeppler) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: NamespaceStack.getAttributeQName caches incorrectly Initial Comment: Affects dom4j 1.6.1 (tested on Android 1.1 / Apache Harmony) I just discovered a serious flaw in the caching of QName objects in NamespaceStack, which results in getting attributes by name only ever works for the first parsed attribute. The problem being with this method: if qualifiedName is the empty string instead of null (which is the case for all attribute nodes being parsed), then this method always returns the same QName object from the cache! Hence, calling node.attribute("a") will return the attribute a if and only if it was parsed before all other attributes; for any other attribute name, that method returns null. I don't have enough insight to tell whether the problem is with this exact method or if qualifiedName shouldn't ever be the empty string in the first place. One way or the other, it's broken. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Rafal Krzewski (rkrzewsk) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: HTMLWriter removes too much whitespace Initial Comment: consider the following DOM tree Element P +Text "aaa " +Element U | +Text "bbb " +Text "ccc" I'd expect it would be prettyprinted as &amp;lt;P&amp;gt;aaa &amp;lt;U&amp;gt;bbb &amp;lt;/U&amp;gt;ccc&amp;lt;/P&amp;gt;. However, the way HTMLWriter is implemented it is prettyprinted as &amp;lt;P&amp;gt;aaa&amp;lt;U&amp;gt;bbb&amp;lt;/U&amp;gt;ccc&amp;lt;/P&amp;gt;. When displayed in the browser the text is run together. IMO the problem is in HTMLWriter.writeText(String) method (line 298 as of revision 1.21).  super.writeString(text.trim()); is called when in fact, the whitespace should either be left alone (trimText == false) or leading and trailing whitespace (if present) should be normalized into single space characters. I can't see any way around that by flipping configuration switches, but if there is one I'd be happy to hear it. Otherwise, I'd be happy to take a swing at fixing that and provide a patch. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Ilja Preu (ipreuss) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: XPathException discards cause's stacktrace Initial Comment: When an XPathException gets caused by another exception, only the message gets remembered, all the rest of the information that comes with the cause exception gets discarded. This is especially tragic when the cause again had a cause. In one case, it took me a whole day to find out that the real cause of an XPathException was a FileNotFoundException. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Daniel Velten (dvelten) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: [dom4j 2.0.0 ALPHA 1] DefaultElement.clone() clears Attribut Initial Comment: In Version 2.0.0 ALPHA 1 is a bug in class org.dom4j.tree.DefaultElement clone() Method. After clone Attributes-List and content-List in the Original and the cloned Element are removed. In the Sourcecode you make first a clone from the original Element. Identical instance of content-List and attributes-List are now on the copy. Then you clear it. So you have removed attributes and content from original and from copy. In the old dom4j Sourcecode Version 1.6.1 they are set to null: This seems to be right in the new version 2.0 too. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Patch for generics support in dom4j</header>
    <body>Hi, I've been using dom4j as a central component in my current project for about six months, and I finally decided I wanted to do something about the warnings about "raw types" in my IDE. I've created a patch that removes about 500 warnings about generics in dom4j. The patch is based of the HEAD of the cvs tree. All tests still pass with these changes. (Actually, StaxTest fails from the command-line, but I think that's a problem with my setup. It passes in Eclipse) The patch is attached (in addition to the generics fix, I also unintentionally removed trailing whitespace in some JavaDoc comments (Eclipse save action). This adds to the size of the patch file) Any chance of getting my patch accepted? Thanks, ~Johannes</body>

This patch tracks whether tags are empty so it can use the right closing method. Patch is from dom4j 1.6.1, but hopefully still applies w/o much rework in 2.0 alpha. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

Category: None Status: Open Resolution: Fixed Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Daniel Velten (dvelten) Assigned to: Filip Jirsák (filipjirsak) Summary: [dom4j 2.0.0 ALPHA 1] DefaultElement.clone() clears Attribut Initial Comment: In Version 2.0.0 ALPHA 1 is a bug in class org.dom4j.tree.DefaultElement clone() Method. After clone Attributes-List and content-List in the Original and the cloned Element are removed. In the Sourcecode you make first a clone from the original Element. Identical instance of content-List and attributes-List are now on the copy. Then you clear it. So you have removed attributes and content from original and from copy. In the old dom4j Sourcecode Version 1.6.1 they are set to null: This seems to be right in the new version 2.0 too. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Filip Jirsák (filipjirsak) Date: 2010-04-06 09:43 Message: fixed in 2.0.0-ALPHA-2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

I don't know if this causes problems in the current release, and anyway it only applies when using Ant, not Maven.

    <header>[dom4j-dev] [announcement] dom4j-2.0.0-ALPHA-2 released</header>
    <body>Hi, dom4j-2.0.0-ALPHA-2 was released yesterday. Changes since dom4j-2.0.0-ALPHA-1: * Fixed serialization and cloning of default nodes implementation (org.dom4j.tree.*) [bug 2941594] * Unit testing library switched from jUnit to TestNG, so we can use for example groups or data factories (for XML files) in future tests. * Zero errors or failures running 641 unit tests. Outstanding goals for dom4j-2.0.0: * Fix bugs listed in  SF.net issue tracker. * Change DocumentFactory to interface, rename current implementation to DefaultDocumentFactory, introduce XPathFactory (as part of DocumentFactory). * Allow change of XPathFactory implementation. * Unify way how implementation of DocumentFactory, XPathFactory, QNameCache can be changed or how theirs default implemenattion can be selected. * Implement W3C DOM 3.0 features. * Better documentation (javaDoc, Cookbook, examples, …). * Reorganize tests (separate implementation unit tests, history bugs tests, library high-level tests), use TestNG parameter factories for reading soucre XML documents. Best regards, Filip Jirsák</body>

    <header>[dom4j-dev] Marshalling JAXB Objects into a dom4j Document</header>
    <body>Hello, I have difficulties marshalling JAXB objects into a dom4j document. I searched for it and what I found was using the JAXBWriter: As the classes I generated with xjc are no JAXBElement instances, I can't use this. How can I convert an object of generated JAXB classes (JAXB 2.2) to a jaxbObject which can be parsed to the writer? The next way would be to convert it first to a DOMDocument which then can be converted to a dom4j document. I don't want to do too much conversions as performance happens, but I tried it anyway: The problem here is that the xml declaration gets dropped somewhere. Is there a way to force the xml declaration? I assume that's a JAXB problem, because the marshaller thinks that doc is a fragment and not a whole document and omits the XML declaration. Can I add the declaration afterwards again? The reason I want to convert it to a dom4j document is that I want to use prettyPrint on output. The DOM writer and the JAXB marshalling to a file is not very customizable and is causing indentation errors: Thanks and kind regards Paul.</body>

Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Matthias (kaeppler) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: NamespaceStack.getAttributeQName caches incorrectly Initial Comment: Affects dom4j 1.6.1 (tested on Android 1.1 / Apache Harmony) I just discovered a serious flaw in the caching of QName objects in NamespaceStack, which results in getting attributes by name only ever works for the first parsed attribute. The problem being with this method: if qualifiedName is the empty string instead of null (which is the case for all attribute nodes being parsed), then this method always returns the same QName object from the cache! Hence, calling node.attribute("a") will return the attribute a if and only if it was parsed before all other attributes; for any other attribute name, that method returns null. I don't have enough insight to tell whether the problem is with this exact method or if qualifiedName shouldn't ever be the empty string in the first place. One way or the other, it's broken. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Denys Nikolayenko (latemic) Date: 2011-03-18 12:07 Message: It seems to be exactly my issue ( I tried two versions dom4j 1.6 and 2.0 alpha and it exists in both.

This breaks the RuleTest greaterThan test when executing with openjdk-7 (I suspect the sort algorithm has probably changed). r1 &amp;gt; r2 = 1 r2 &amp;lt; r1 = 0 (should be -1) Attached patch fixes this issue and adds some extra tests to cover all &amp;gt; &amp;lt; and == ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

	BranchTreeNode.getChildCount()</header>
    <body>Bugs item #3547784, was opened at 2012-07-23 22:14 Message generated for change (Tracker Item Submitted) made by mischi You can respond by visiting:  Please note that this message will contain a full copy of the comment thread, including the initial issue submission, for this request, not just the latest update. Category: None Group: dom4j 2.0 Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Michael Pradel (mischi) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: NullPointerException from BranchTreeNode.getChildCount() Initial Comment: Calling getChildCount() on a newly created BranchTreeNode raises a NullPointerException. E.g.: n.getChildCount();  // raises NPE This is surprising for two reasons: 1) Calling a getter on a new instance shouldn't raise any exception. 2) Doing the same with LeafTreeNode, the superclass of BranchTreeNode, works fine. I.e. BranchTreeNode is incompatible with its own superclass: n.getChildCount();  // OK Is this inconsistency intended? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>

	whereas DefaultElement doesn't</header>

Category: None Group: dom4j 2.0 Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Michael Pradel (mischi) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: BeanElement throws exception whereas DefaultElement doesn't Initial Comment: We get a ClassCastException when using a DefaultElement that happens to be a BeanElement. The exception doesn't occur with DefaultElement. A minimal example: The following works fine: But this fails: The behavior of BeanElement diverges from the superclass behavior, which is very surprising here. The problem is that DefaultElement initializes its 'attributes' field with a LazyList, but BeanElement expects the field to be a BeanAttributeList. Am I right when guessing that BeanElement should initialize the field with a BeanAttributeList? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:</body>
