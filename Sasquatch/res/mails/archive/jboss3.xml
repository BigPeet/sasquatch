    <body>h1. Overview This document details the process for building and releasing composite/aggregate update sites for the JBoss integration tooling (formerly SOA tools). h2. Goals * Provide a light-weight process with minimal overhead for component owners. * Provide an ever-current update site containing the latest, stable releases of integration tooling components. * Allow component owners to independently manage their release schedules. * Allow component owners to manage their own dependency stack. h2. Assumptions * Components use released versions of dependencies (i.e. stable builds). * Component owners manage their own interdependencies with other integration components. * Components and dependencies adhere to Eclipse API versioning rules. h2. Implications * Aggregate releases will be driven by component releases. * Aggregate releases should manage themselves. * Component nightly/milestone builds should always be compatible with other components in the aggregate. h2. Definitions * *Integration Stack (IS)* - all JBoss middleware integration tooling * *IS configuration* - the definition of specific components and versions that make up the IS * *IS build* - an update site (p2 repo) aggregating specific versions of integration tooling components. * *Release types:** *stable* - an IS build aggregating stable (i.e. final) builds of all components that has been certified/tested by QA. * *development* - an IS build aggregating stable builds of all components that has not been certified/tested by QA. * *integration* - an IS build aggregating stable, development (e.g. beta) and/or integration builds of all components * *next* - an internal IS build incorporating the latest integration builds of all components (i.e. the current "trunk" build).  This will be used for identifying potential future incompatibilities. Stable builds will align  with a JBDS release in the same way JBT core builds do today.  Development builds will reflect the current state of all stable components.  Theoretically, any development build could be QA'd and promoted to stable (assuming no test failures).  Integration builds allow for an "interim" stack which may be useful during a QA cycle (e.g. verifying a fix that requires updates to multiple components; a single component can be updated via the component update site).  Next builds are used to identify potential incompatiblilities among components before they are integrated into a release and would occur weekly/monthly via a Hudson job (e.g. targeting JBT integration builds). An IS build only needs to occur when the IS configuration changes.  Because the IS stack is composed of stable components, configuration changes will only occur when individual components are released.  For this reason, it is assumed the build would be invoked manually. h1. Roles and Responsibilities h2. Component Owners 1. *Component update site:*  Component owners must provide an update site for each release of their component that is included in an IS build. 2. *Updating IS configuration:*  Component owners must update the IS build configuration when a new version of their component is released.  This ensures the IS is up-to-date. 3. *Respond to change requests:*  Component owners must review IS configuration change requests and respond in a timely manner.  If a requested change is incompatible with the current version of your component, provide details regarding when your component will be compatible, along with a patch containing changes to the IS configuration for your compatible release. h2. Release Engineers 1. *Maintain build infrastructure:*  Release engineers will be responsible for maintianing the build infrastructure, primarily the Jenkins jobs. 2. *Processing pull requests:*  Release engineers will be responsible processing all pull requests related to IS configuration.  This is to ensure consistency in the composition of the stack (e.g. components, component versions, IS version, etc.). 3. *Initiate IS builds:*  Release engineers will be responsible for initiating IS builds. 4. *Build promotion:*  Release engineers will be responsible for the promotion of IS builds (e.g. from development to stable). h1. Release Process h2. Component Updates The following outlines the basic process for updating the IS configuration.  Typically, this would occur when a component is released, but the same process is also used for updating shared dependencies (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins, etc.). 1. Create a branch in the user repository for your IS configuration changes. 2. Modify the Integration Stack configuration for your updates, e.g. update URL for SwitchYard from 0.5.0.Final to 0.6.0.Final; update IS version from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (see versioning rules)1. For changes to your component within the aggregate:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/aggregate-site https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/aggregate-site1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/compositeContent.xml compositeContent.xml files to point to the new component update site. 2. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/category.xml category.xml file as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify the project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/pom.xml pom.xml. 2. For changes to dependencies:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform1. Modify  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/base.target base.target or  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/community.target community.target 2. Modify project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/pom.xml pom.xml 3. Ensure plugins are mirrored on jboss.org 3. Build locally to validate stack dependencies. 4. Create a  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS JBTIS JIRA task requesting update, e.g. update SwitchYard to 0.6.0.Final* Include link to github branch in task * Include build  results (e.g. SUCCESS or specific dependency resolution errors) 5. Create subtasks against each IS component for verification/approval* For components that failed the consistency check, mark subtasks appropriately, e.g. m2e-wtp version is inconsistent 6. Merge any changes required by other components from subtasks (e.g. update Savara to 2.1.0.Final) 7. Build IS locally to validate dependency consistency 8. Issue pull request against upstream IS configuration project 9. Process pull (by release engineer) 10. Invoke build job (by release engineer) h2. Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. JBoss Central Discovery Updates *Goal:* Modify the JBoss Central mylyn discovery install/update mechanism. JBoss Central, based on  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Discovery Mylyn Discovery, is in part a UI for installing new features into Eclipse or JBDS. It provider a richer, yet simpler UI than what Eclipse's p2 Install Manager provides out of the box. For detailed information see  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-48297 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossCentralsSoftwareUpdateTab-HowDoesItWork 1. For changes to dependencies:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/discovery 2. Follow the same git process as defined in the Components Updates section. 3. Modify the discovery connectors as needed within the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/discovery/plugins/org.jboss.tools.central.discovery.soa-tooling/plugin.xml discovery plugin. 4. Add any icons that may be required. h2. Dependency Updates The process for updating a shared dependency is the same as that for updating any other component, with the following additions: 1. Make sure the dependency is mirrored on jboss.org. 2. Make sure the dependency is not already included through JBT core. If a dependency is included through JBT core, you will need to coordinate with the core team on the upgrade, as the change may impact components outside the IS. h2. Versioning Rules - major.minor.update.build *Major* should be updated for: * Base platform changes, e.g. Eclipse Indigo-&gt;Juno, JBT 3.3-&gt;4.0 * Major component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 1.0-&gt;2.0 *Minor* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5-&gt;0.6 *Update* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5.0-&gt;0.5.1 *Build* should be updated for each build, e.g. when building against nightly/integration/development repositories ** Note, the basic assumption here is that components are adhering to basic API rules (per Eclipse; e.g. minor includes bug fixes and api additions, major may include breaking api changes). h1. Update Site Locations * *Integration builds:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Development builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Stable builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* h1. Infrastructure * *JIRA -*  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS * *Source -*  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack* *target-platform* - provides a target platform defining all upstream dependencies for use by IS components (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins) * *aggregate-site* - provides category and feature definitions for the IS update site * *discovery* - provides JBoss Central discovery support * *Jenkins* - * *target platform* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-target-platform https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-target-platform * *aggregate* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-aggregate https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-aggregate * *aggregate publish/promote* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-aggregate-publish https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-aggregate-publish * *discovery* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-discovery https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-discovery * *install tests* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-4.0_stable_branch.director-install-tests.eclipse42x.jbt40x.matrix https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-4.0_stable_branch.director-install-tests.eclipse42x.jbt40x.matrix h2. Target Platforms The provided target platforms define all upstream dependencies available to an IS component.  Two target platforms are provided: base and community.  The base target platform includes all dependencies which are also included as part of JBDS.  The community target extends the base target by including dependencies which are only available in  community JBT releases.  If your component needs to be included in a JBDS release, DO NOT use the community target platform. h1. Future Plans 1. Add support for executing component unit tests as part of the aggregate build.  The goal being to help ensure the stability of the aggregate. 2. Add a "next" build that will build against upcoming core platforms (e.g. Kepler, JBT 5).  This should serve as an early warning system to identify platform incompatibilities early in the process.</body>

Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. JBoss Central Discovery Updates *Goal:* Modify the JBoss Central mylyn discovery install/update mechanism. JBoss Central, based on  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Discovery Mylyn Discovery, is in part a UI for installing new features into Eclipse or JBDS. It provides a richer, yet simpler UI than what Eclipse's p2 Install Manager provides out of the box. For detailed information see  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-48297 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossCentralsSoftwareUpdateTab-HowDoesItWork 1. For changes to the discovery update:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/discovery 2. Follow the same git process as defined in the Components Updates section. 3. Modify the discovery connector descriptors and installation units as needed within the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/discovery/plugins/org.jboss.tools.central.discovery.soa-tooling/plugin.xml discovery plugin. 4. Add any icons that may be required. h2. Dependency Updates The process for updating a shared dependency is the same as that for updating any other component, with the following additions: 1. Make sure the dependency is mirrored on jboss.org. 2. Make sure the dependency is not already included through JBT core. If a dependency is included through JBT core, you will need to coordinate with the core team on the upgrade, as the change may impact components outside the IS. h2. Versioning Rules - major.minor.update.build *Major* should be updated for: * Base platform changes, e.g. Eclipse Indigo-&gt;Juno, JBT 3.3-&gt;4.0 * Major component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 1.0-&gt;2.0 *Minor* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5-&gt;0.6 *Update* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5.0-&gt;0.5.1 *Build* should be updated for each build, e.g. when building against nightly/integration/development repositories ** Note, the basic assumption here is that components are adhering to basic API rules (per Eclipse; e.g. minor includes bug fixes and api additions, major may include breaking api changes). h1.

Target Platforms The provided target platforms define all upstream dependencies available to an IS component.  Two target platforms are provided: base and community.  The base target platform includes all dependencies which are also included as part of JBDS.  The community target extends the base target by including dependencies which are only available in  community JBT releases.  If your component needs to be included in a JBDS release, DO NOT use the community target platform. h1. Future Plans 1. Add support for executing component unit tests as part of the aggregate build.  The goal being to help ensure the stability of the aggregate. 2. Add a "next" build that will build against upcoming core platforms (e.g. Kepler, JBT 4.1).  This should serve as an early warning system to identify platform incompatibilities early in the process.</body>

    <body>I fixed the Kepler/JBT 5 to Kepler/JBT 4.1. About major version bump then I just want to point out Indigo-&gt;Juno is Eclipse 3.3 to 4.2, where as Juno-&gt;Kepler is 4.2 to 4.3 so its two different kind of jumps. In JBT we bumped major version of JBoss tools because Eclipse bumped major versions and changed hard.</body>

    <body>How does one perform a build w/ mvn and point it at your TP definition? I'm assuming it'll be something like mvn clean install -Psomeprofile or mvn clean install -Dsomeproperty=somevalue ... Reason I'm asking is that ESB needs Zest, and having it on the aggregate site won't make it BUILD, only make it INSTALL. It needs to be on an update site from which the build can resolve it first. Where is your target platform UPDATE SITE? Or how do I tell the build to use your .target file?</body>

    <body>I think I don't quite understand approach #2: I cloned my existing JBoss AS installation directory and kept everything as it was, except for the file system paths and the port-offset parameter of the socket-binding-group. But when I try to start the second instance, the console output is "ERROR: transport error 202: bind failed: The address is already in use". Is there a part of approach #1 that I need to include in following approach #2? The reason I went with approach #2 to begin with is that I want both instances to be reachable from the Internet, so I figured I'd have to bind them both to &lt;any-address&gt;. Or to the host's external IP address? Or am I completely missing something here?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - What is the best way to work with sessions and processes while using persistance</header>
    <body>Hi, Actually, i m a newbie in jbpm so please comment/criticize any wrong thing u think i m doing. In order to work on processes with human tasks nodes and use persistance, i had the choice between creating a session for each process or to create a session for many processes in the same time. i choosed the first solution as i can free the memory by disposing the session(with ksession.dipose()) before creating another one and reload it with the JPAKnowledgeService.loadStatefulKnowledgeSession(idsession,kbase, config, env);  method when i need it again. if i was working with the second solution, i create a session and i start  processes with ksession.startProcess(..) but i don't know how to stop/pause those process instances in order to free memory ( i m working with jbpm 5.0.0) .. Another problem happened is that processes in loaded session (in the first solution) seems being not actives (i coudn't get tasks from loaded sessions) and i think maybe becose the session was disposed .. (it was my topic for my previous asked question in here https://community.jboss.org/thread/221356?tstart=0 i also want to know if there is a way to get the persisted sessions list from database without implementing my own logic to do that , i think jbpm already have this logic. cheers !</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Integration Tooling	Release Process</header>
    <body>h1. Overview This document details the process for building and releasing composite/aggregate update sites for the JBoss integration tooling (formerly SOA tools). h2. Goals * Provide a light-weight process with minimal overhead for component owners. * Provide an ever-current update site containing the latest, stable releases of integration tooling components. * Allow component owners to independently manage their release schedules. * Allow component owners to manage their own dependency stack. h2. Assumptions * Components use released versions of dependencies (i.e. stable builds). * Component owners manage their own interdependencies with other integration components. * Components and dependencies adhere to Eclipse API versioning rules. h2. Implications * Aggregate releases will be driven by component releases. * Aggregate releases should manage themselves. * Component nightly/milestone builds should always be compatible with other components in the aggregate. h2. Definitions * *Integration Stack (IS)* - all JBoss middleware integration tooling * *IS configuration* - the definition of specific components and versions that make up the IS * *IS build* - an update site (p2 repo) aggregating specific versions of integration tooling components. * *Release types:** *stable* - an IS build aggregating stable (i.e. final) builds of all components that has been certified/tested by QA. * *development* - an IS build aggregating stable builds of all components that has not been certified/tested by QA. * *integration* - an IS build aggregating stable, development (e.g. beta) and/or integration builds of all components * *next* - an internal IS build incorporating the latest integration builds of all components (i.e. the current "trunk" build).  This will be used for identifying potential future incompatibilities. Stable builds will align  with a JBDS release in the same way JBT core builds do today.  Development builds will reflect the current state of all stable components.  Theoretically, any development build could be QA'd and promoted to stable (assuming no test failures).  Integration builds allow for an "interim" stack which may be useful during a QA cycle (e.g. verifying a fix that requires updates to multiple components; a single component can be updated via the component update site).  Next builds are used to identify potential incompatiblilities among components before they are integrated into a release and would occur weekly/monthly via a Hudson job (e.g. targeting JBT integration builds). An IS build only needs to occur when the IS configuration changes.  Because the IS stack is composed of stable components, configuration changes will only occur when individual components are released.  For this reason, it is assumed the build would be invoked manually. h1. Roles and Responsibilities h2. Component Owners 1. *Component update site:*  Component owners must provide an update site for each release of their component that is included in an IS build. 2. *Updating IS configuration:*  Component owners must update the IS build configuration when a new version of their component is released.  This ensures the IS is up-to-date. 3. *Respond to change requests:*  Component owners must review IS configuration change requests and respond in a timely manner.  If a requested change is incompatible with the current version of your component, provide details regarding when your component will be compatible, along with a patch containing changes to the IS configuration for your compatible release. h2. Release Engineers 1. *Maintain build infrastructure:*  Release engineers will be responsible for maintianing the build infrastructure, primarily the Jenkins jobs. 2. *Processing pull requests:*  Release engineers will be responsible processing all pull requests related to IS configuration.  This is to ensure consistency in the composition of the stack (e.g. components, component versions, IS version, etc.). 3. *Initiate IS builds:*  Release engineers will be responsible for initiating IS builds. 4. *Build promotion:*  Release engineers will be responsible for the promotion of IS builds (e.g. from development to stable). h1. Release Process h2. Component Updates The following outlines the basic process for updating the IS configuration.  Typically, this would occur when a component is released, but the same process is also used for updating shared dependencies (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins, etc.). 1. Create a branch in the user repository for your IS configuration changes. 2. Modify the Integration Stack configuration for your updates, e.g. update URL for SwitchYard from 0.5.0.Final to 0.6.0.Final; update IS version from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (see versioning rules)1. For changes to your component within the aggregate:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/aggregate-site https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/aggregate-site1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/compositeContent.xml compositeContent.xml files to point to the new component update site. 2. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/category.xml category.xml file as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify the project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/pom.xml pom.xml. 2. For changes to dependencies:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform1. Modify  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/base.target base.target or  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/community.target community.target 2. Modify project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/pom.xml pom.xml 3. Ensure plugins are mirrored on jboss.org 3. Build locally to validate stack dependencies. 4. Create a  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS JBTIS JIRA task requesting update, e.g. update SwitchYard to 0.6.0.Final* Include link to github branch in task * Include build  results (e.g. SUCCESS or specific dependency resolution errors) 5. Create subtasks against each IS component for verification/approval* For components that failed the consistency check, mark subtasks appropriately, e.g. m2e-wtp version is inconsistent 6. Merge any changes required by other components from subtasks (e.g. update Savara to 2.1.0.Final) 7. Build IS locally to validate dependency consistency 8. Issue pull request against upstream IS configuration project 9. Process pull (by release engineer) 10. Invoke build job (by release engineer) h2. Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. JBoss Central Discovery Updates *Goal:* Modify the JBoss Central mylyn discovery install/update mechanism.

It provides a richer, yet simpler UI than what Eclipse's p2 Install Manager provides out of the box.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Can I show my apps' knowledge session in the jBPM Console?</header>
    <body>Hi.  I am using jBPM 5.4.  I have defined a process in guvnor and have an application that retreives that process from guvnor and creates a knowledge session (pretty straight forward).  Now, I want jBPM console to show the processes running in MY knowledge session.  My own application will "drive" the process (start the process, and send signals to it).  I would like to "attach" the console so that I can follow the progress of the process running in my application. All of the Console examples I have seen are controlled (started/stopped) from the Console itself.   I was hoping the new jBPM Developer Guide would provide some insight, but no luck finding it.  Has anyone done this?  Can anyone suggest a way forward or point me to some examples? Thanks very much! -J</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - AS8: JBoss Security	Manager discussion</header>
    <body>David M Lloyd, Stefan, Flavia and I had a high level discussion on supporting Java Security Manager in AS8 in line with the needs of EE7 and JBoss Modules. We had an etherpad discussion. h2. Etherpad Requirements (Let us capture general requirements here) Support for VMwide Security Manager policy? Support META-INF/permissions.xml required by EE7  for web, ejb and application clients Maintain relationships established by JACC specification for Run As vs. AccessControlContext Application components must be able to support at least the permissions listed in Table EE.6-2 in EE(7).6.2.2.3. Deployers must support application component permissions as specified by EE.6.2.2.6. Server  administrators must have a way of declaring permission restrictions for  deployments.  If a deployment with declared permissions does not meet  the configured permission set, the deployment must fail as per  EE.6.2.2.6. Perform wellIdeally  we will be able to use a more efficient mechanism to evaluate  permissions than a complete execution stack scan.  The JDK always grants  itself all permissions - by checking the class loader for null -                 and  generally acts  as if doPrivileged is always in force.  Perhaps we can  utilize a similar trick to allow our provided modules to execute  quickly. Discussion Points Should we do permissions within module.xml? (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODULES-157) Action Items 1. Deployment Descriptor parsing for META-INF/permissions.xml 2. Domain.xml/Standalone.xml global permission block (parsing and handling) 3. JBoss Modules permission handling  (parsing and handling) 4. System to merge deployment permissions into the module defined permissions. Questions Should permissions.xml for Web Deployments be in WEB-INF and not META-INF? JSR342 draft seems to imply they will be in META-INF  (Answer:  permissions.xml is a SE requirement for the EE platform. So it is META-INF) Chat Discussion h2. February 20, 2013 12:49 Stefan: there are some horrible things like having a WEB-INF/classes/META-INF 12:49 Anil Saldhana: that is persistence.xml 12:50 Stefan: the only thing I would like to know is where the admin perms would be stored 12:50 Anil Saldhana: module.xml 12:50 dmlloyd: that is a big question, and also, what form should it take 12:50 Stefan: yeah 12:50 dmlloyd: for deployments I think the standalone/domain.xml should contain the admin policy, but I don't know what capabilities we should give it 12:51 dmlloyd: e.g. do we require the admin perm overrides to be present  at deploy time (assume AllPermission if not present), or do we have a general config that includes matching wildcards, or what 12:52 Anil Saldhana: we can leave it to the admin - AllPerm or denyall 12:52 Anil Saldhana: when we ship, we go with allperm 12:53 dmlloyd: my gut feeling is that we'll need something more nuanced than an all-on/all-off switch 12:53 Stefan: have to agree with david on this one 12:53 Anil Saldhana: domain.xml contains the default permission policy 12:53 Anil Saldhana: overrides happen in module.xml 12:53 dmlloyd: deployments do not contain a module.xml 12:53 Anil Saldhana: and permissions.xml/rar.xml 12:54 dmlloyd: for deployments we'd rely on META-INF/permissions.xml 12:54 dmlloyd: yeah 12:54 Anil Saldhana: right 12:54 dmlloyd: on the other hand, standalone/domain.xml permissions will not affect filesystem modules 12:54 dmlloyd: that global policy (if any) has to be statically defined somewhere 12:55 dmlloyd: like I said though - if we can avoid global policy files, that's best 12:56 dmlloyd: the policy file mechanism is defined by convention, not spec, therefore we shouldn't rely on it 12:56 Anil Saldhana: no requirement to go with policy file 12:58 dmlloyd: it implies though that if we do want an overriding global policy of some sort, it has to be of our own format, and it has to come from jboss modules 12:58 dmlloyd: so that jboss modules can merge the policy with that of the individual modules 13:00 Anil Saldhana: since modules is the building block, it makes sense to have it at the module level 13:00 Anil Saldhana: we definitely should think more from securing modules 13:00 Anil Saldhana: more from the perspective of securing the system via modules 13:03 dmlloyd: I'm not 100% brushed up on how protectiondomains and ACCs and all that stuff play together though 13:04 Anil Saldhana: I think once we start playing with it, we will see the challenges 13:05 dmlloyd: if one of you guys is already an expert that'd really help 13:05 dmlloyd: save some time 13:05 Anil Saldhana: this can actually be done in the modules project 13:06 Anil Saldhana: I mean test cases and performance measures 13:06 Anil Saldhana: what the SM does is very small IMO 13:06 dmlloyd: I can wire in the basic infrastructure to modules but a second/third pair of eyes would be good to have 13:06 Anil Saldhana: setting up the protection domains at the module CL level 13:06 Anil Saldhana: we will be there, DML 13:07 Anil Saldhana: I think I will start establishing some processes around this.  testing/configuration etc. 13:07 dmlloyd: that is but one task though 13:07 dmlloyd: I think that it might be a good idea to create a top-level JIRA with subtasks to track the individual work units, with a dependent relationship to the EE7 JIRA subtask 13:08 dmlloyd: work units like: 13:08 dmlloyd: descriptor parsing 13:08 Anil Saldhana: right 13:08 dmlloyd: DUP changes to install permissions into the module spec 13:08 Anil Saldhana: Action Items to the left here.  :) 13:08 Anil Saldhana: I will set up the JIRA issues for the action items 13:08 dmlloyd: subsystem config 13:08 dmlloyd: etc. 13:12 Anil Saldhana: will list the action items here and start creating subtasks 13:14 dmlloyd: I guess that's about it, other than just testing 13:14 Anil Saldhana: right.  few minutes - check the action items here 13:15 Anil Saldhana: once you are happy, I can transfer to subtasks in JIRA 13:15 dmlloyd: I'd feel better if we had some plan for global module config, and an idea of how the global domain config might look 13:15 Anil Saldhana: we need to have that discussion. 13:16 dmlloyd: we can create a subtask placeholder for the domain config question and then open it up for discussion on the dev list 13:16 Anil Saldhana: right 13:16 Anil Saldhana: added some action items. take a look 13:17 dmlloyd: AS DUP implementation to merge descriptor information into the module definition 13:24 dmlloyd: I guess that's it for now 13:24 dmlloyd: we can always add more later as things come up 13:25 dmlloyd: did we lose Stefan? 13:26 Anil Saldhana: probably 13:26 Anil Saldhana: they have electricity issues due to summer thunderstorms in Brazil 13:31 dmlloyd: FYI the subtask in the EE7 task should stay right where it is 13:32 dmlloyd: you can't have a task hierarchy, so we need a new top-level JIRA that links back to that subtask 13:32 dmlloyd: with notes to close one when you close the other 13:32 Anil Saldhana: ok 13:32 Anil Saldhana: did not realize it was a subtask.  :)</body>

February 20, 2013 Anil Saldhana: Just want to have a general chat on this topic... 12:19 Anil Saldhana: Important for Stefan to participate. 12:19 Anil Saldhana: Flavia mainly because DML mentioned modules 12:20 Stefan: Ok, so app components must now support the declaration of security permissions. Besides, we need to consider setting up permissions for the modules 12:21 Anil Saldhana: previously,  ra.xml could contain security permissions 12:21 Anil Saldhana: now additionally permissions.xml can be provided 12:21 Stefan: right, I believe the model is pretty similar to the one found in ra.xml 12:22 Anil Saldhana: the bigger Q is should we support permissions in module.xml? 12:22 Anil Saldhana: we discussed that in Aug 2011 with no action.  :) 12:22 Stefan: I believe we do. What do we do now when the sec manager is active and one of the modules contains code that needs permissions 12:23 Anil Saldhana: The key aspects for a security manager access check  includes CodeSource, Permissions and Subject Anil Saldhana: CodeSource is driven by the classloader 12:24 Stefan: perms come from config and subject from the underlying sec context 12:25 Stefan: what happens now if sec manager is enabled on AS7? Do we have an AllPerm for all modules? 12:25 Anil Saldhana: I dont think so.  Right now, they are governed by the codesource url 12:26 Anil Saldhana: defined in the general policy file. 12:26 Anil Saldhana: DML wanted to see if we could add sec permissions at the module level 12:27 Stefan: I think it is a good idea but the amount of work required for that can be insane due to the number of modules 12:28 Anil Saldhana: it is NOT required for all modules. If admin wants to do for a select set of modules, he should be able to 12:29 Flavia: okay, so this does not affect MSC directly, it will affect Modules afaics 12:31 Anil Saldhana: Who does modules? 12:32 Flavia: I am not sure, but I think that mostly David 12:33 Flavia: I agree with Stefan that there could be a perf impact if we add this to every single module in AS 12:33 Anil Saldhana: Remember it is user's choice whether they run AS under a JSM 12:37 Anil Saldhana: hey DML. etherpad is insanely slow 12:37 dmlloyd: at least it's up.  This morning there was an outage 12:40 Anil Saldhana: I brought in your comments from the other ether here. 12:40 dmlloyd: My thought with modules is that they could request to be granted AllPermission by default 12:40 dmlloyd: that way we don't have to go through and retroactively redo every one 12:40 dmlloyd: but we can, later on, restrict modules if we want to 12:41 Anil Saldhana: Agree. 12:41 dmlloyd: my main motivation is to avoid having a global security policy file 12:41 dmlloyd: that's never been anything but a PITA 12:42 dmlloyd: by supporting it in modules we can establish permissions by class loader instead of code source 12:42 Anil Saldhana: the challenge is for a complete system, you will have to evaluate every module. 12:42 Anil Saldhana: if you have ALLPerm for unspecified modules 12:42 dmlloyd: we can simply compile and install the permissions as the modules are loaded 12:43 Anil Saldhana: where are they specified? 12:43 dmlloyd: in module.xml 12:43 dmlloyd: those would be the permissions the module requests, not necessarily the permissions they are granted 12:44 Stefan: ok, so we would be adding an AllPerm to every module.xml, leaving us with something that can be refined with timeso the idea is to add an AllPerm to every module.xml? 12:44 dmlloyd: ideally an administrator would also have their vote as to what permissions to use, and the effective permissions would be the union of the two 12:44 dmlloyd: yeah that's the idea 12:44 dmlloyd: really it's not so different from the EE7 rules - the deployment contains requested permissions, the administrator can further limit them, and the result is a union 12:44 Stefan: for some reason part of what I wrote was duplicated 12:45 dmlloyd: probably because etherpad is junk  :) 12:45 Stefan: union or intersection 12:45 dmlloyd: intersection, sorry 12:45 Stefan: ah, ok  :) 12:45 Anil Saldhana: I am fine with it.  We should discuss this with Jason and the list. 12:45 dmlloyd: cripes, I wonder how long I've been doing that. 12:46 Anil Saldhana: DML - permissions.xml can be in META-INF 12:47 Anil Saldhana: for web deployments, should they go in WEB-INF? 12:47 dmlloyd: I'd say META-INF only, unless the EE or servlet spec specifically allow for WEB-INF 12:47 Anil Saldhana: I thought web deployments typically used WEB-INF 12:47 Anil Saldhana: these are SE requirements for EE 12:47 dmlloyd: they do for web stuff 12:47 Anil Saldhana: so maybe META-INF 12:48 dmlloyd: but servlet is a rule-breaker in a lot of ways 12:48 dmlloyd: they do require META-INF for a few things too, by spec (though I think in some cases we allow WEB-INF) 12:49 Anil Saldhana: stefan , what do you think?  Allperm for all modules  and admin changes based on his requirement 12:49 Stefan: there are some horrible things like having a WEB-INF/classes/META-INF 12:49 Anil Saldhana: that is persistence.xml 12:50 Stefan: the only thing I would like to know is where the admin perms would be stored 12:50 Anil Saldhana: module.xml 12:50 dmlloyd: that is a big question, and also, what form should it take 12:50 Stefan: yeah 12:50 dmlloyd: for deployments I think the standalone/domain.xml should contain the admin policy, but I don't know what capabilities we should give it 12:51 dmlloyd: e.g. do we require the admin perm overrides to be present  at deploy time (assume AllPermission if not present), or do we have a general config that includes matching wildcards, or what 12:52 Anil Saldhana: we can leave it to the admin - AllPerm or denyall 12:52 Anil Saldhana: when we ship, we go with allperm 12:53 dmlloyd: my gut feeling is that we'll need something more nuanced than an all-on/all-off switch 12:53 Stefan: have to agree with david on this one 12:53 Anil Saldhana: domain.xml contains the default permission policy 12:53 Anil Saldhana: overrides happen in module.xml 12:53 dmlloyd: deployments do not contain a module.xml 12:53 Anil Saldhana: and permissions.xml/rar.xml 12:54 dmlloyd: for deployments we'd rely on META-INF/permissions.xml 12:54 dmlloyd: yeah 12:54 Anil Saldhana: right 12:54 dmlloyd: on the other hand, standalone/domain.xml permissions will not affect filesystem modules 12:54 dmlloyd: that global policy (if any) has to be statically defined somewhere 12:55 dmlloyd: like I said though - if we can avoid global policy files, that's best 12:56 dmlloyd: the policy file mechanism is defined by convention, not spec, therefore we shouldn't rely on it 12:56 Anil Saldhana: no requirement to go with policy file 12:58 dmlloyd: it implies though that if we do want an overriding global policy of some sort, it has to be of our own format, and it has to come from jboss modules 12:58 dmlloyd: so that jboss modules can merge the policy with that of the individual modules 13:00 Anil Saldhana: since modules is the building block, it makes sense to have it at the module level 13:00 Anil Saldhana: we definitely should think more from securing modules 13:00 Anil Saldhana: more from the perspective of securing the system via modules 13:03 dmlloyd: I'm not 100% brushed up on how protectiondomains and ACCs and all that stuff play together though 13:04 Anil Saldhana: I think once we start playing with it, we will see the challenges 13:05 dmlloyd: if one of you guys is already an expert that'd really help 13:05 dmlloyd: save some time 13:05 Anil Saldhana: this can actually be done in the modules project 13:06 Anil Saldhana: I mean test cases and performance measures 13:06 Anil Saldhana: what the SM does is very small IMO 13:06 dmlloyd: I can wire in the basic infrastructure to modules but a second/third pair of eyes would be good to have 13:06 Anil Saldhana: setting up the protection domains at the module CL level 13:06 Anil Saldhana: we will be there, DML 13:07 Anil Saldhana: I think I will start establishing some processes around this.  testing/configuration etc. 13:07 dmlloyd: that is but one task though 13:07 dmlloyd: I think that it might be a good idea to create a top-level JIRA with subtasks to track the individual work units, with a dependent relationship to the EE7 JIRA subtask 13:08 dmlloyd: work units like: 13:08 dmlloyd: descriptor parsing 13:08 Anil Saldhana: right 13:08 dmlloyd: DUP changes to install permissions into the module spec 13:08 Anil Saldhana: Action Items to the left here.  :) 13:08 Anil Saldhana: I will set up the JIRA issues for the action items 13:08 dmlloyd: subsystem config 13:08 dmlloyd: etc. 13:12 Anil Saldhana: will list the action items here and start creating subtasks 13:14 dmlloyd: I guess that's about it, other than just testing 13:14 Anil Saldhana: right.  few minutes - check the action items here 13:15 Anil Saldhana: once you are happy, I can transfer to subtasks in JIRA 13:15 dmlloyd: I'd feel better if we had some plan for global module config, and an idea of how the global domain config might look 13:15 Anil Saldhana: we need to have that discussion. 13:16 dmlloyd: we can create a subtask placeholder for the domain config question and then open it up for discussion on the dev list 13:16 Anil Saldhana: right 13:16 Anil Saldhana: added some action items. take a look 13:17 dmlloyd: AS DUP implementation to merge descriptor information into the module definition 13:24 dmlloyd: I guess that's it for now 13:24 dmlloyd: we can always add more later as things come up 13:25 dmlloyd: did we lose Stefan? 13:26 Anil Saldhana: probably 13:26 Anil Saldhana: they have electricity issues due to summer thunderstorms in Brazil 13:31 dmlloyd: FYI the subtask in the EE7 task should stay right where it is 13:32 dmlloyd: you can't have a task hierarchy, so we need a new top-level JIRA that links back to that subtask 13:32 dmlloyd: with notes to close one when you close the other 13:32 Anil Saldhana: ok 13:32 Anil Saldhana: did not realize it was a subtask.  :) h2.

    <body>Another suggestions for disabling JARs is to double-compress them, then uncompress them to re-enable. I would love to hear any feedback on this JAR-disabling proposal. Also I'd like to +1 Mazz's earlier comment about not applying this mechanism to RPM. This is definitely a big step forward for the zip distribution, but RPM is an established patching solution, there's no need to re-invent the wheel for RPM.</body>

    <body>problem is that you try to use (probably by mistake) a disposed session:                    // Let's reload the session                   // All the listeners and WorkItemHandlers are volatile, so we need to register them each time that we reload the session                   //  from the DB. ksession (marked in bold) is disposed session and thus should not be used any more.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - AS8: JBoss Security Manager Implementation Plan</header>
    <body>This wiki article will propose an implementation plan for the security manager related changes for JBoss AS8. h2. Background Please follow  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-48383 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AS8JBossSecurityManagerDiscussion   for some background information. Goal is to minimize the global policy file +historic+ approach and adapt the Java Security Manager infrastructure in AS8 to a more modular approach. h2. Approach * We will have a security manager subsystem to define the global permission collection that modules will inherit by default.  * module.xml can define the permission collection that governs the module.  This is what the ModuleClassLoader will return to the security manager when asked for permission collection. * EE deployments can do META-INF/permissions.xml (as per EE7).   The deployment permissions need to be merged into the module level permissions. h2. h2. Security Manager and Policy Implementation The JVM can run under a Java Security Manager via two options: * Pass  -Djava.security.manager as command option * Programmatically, call    System.setSecurityManager(securityManager) So we have two options to start the security manager in AS8.  (+I personally like the programmatic option that will let the JVM and JBoss Modules system to start up before the security manager is put into operation+). h3. Command Line Option When we use the command line option,  the default security manager implementation (that uses Sun PolicyFile implementation)   will use the java.policy file from jre/lib/security folder of the JVM to construct the permissions that the JVM will have in starting up.  This takes care of the JVM starting up. We will need to bootstrap the JBoss Modules system.  Now we have to think about providing the permissions for the jboss-modules.jar  The easiest way to achieve this is to add an entry into the java.policy file.   or  have a single entry in a policy file within the AS8 folders and mandate users not add/delete anything from this file.   This will get the JBoss Modules system starting. Once the module system is started,  we will use the programmatic stuff below. h3. Programmatic Option There will be a security manager subsystem defined in the domain model.   It will have a flag called *+enable+*  which by default will be +false+.   If the user configures the +enable+ flag to true,  the program will call +System.setSecurityManager()+,  if  +System.getSecurityManager() == null+. The security manager subsystem can define the permission block for use by default by the module class loader.</body>

Once the module system is started,  we will use the programmatic stuff below. h3. Command Line Option #2 JBoss Modules has a special bootstrap option for security manager startup.  Instead of passing -Djava.security.manager to the JVM, you run JBoss Modules with the -secmgr flag.  This loads up a special policy that grants JBoss Modules AllPermission, but otherwise inherits the Policy defined by the JVM (or the application, if it has one).  In this way, JBoss AS can be started up under a security manager without any other special setup (in particular, without a JVM-specific policy file).  Requires at least 1.2.0.CR2 for proper operation. h3. Programmatic Option There will be a security manager subsystem defined in the domain model.   It will have a flag called *+enable+*  which by default will be +false+.   If the user configures the +enable+ flag to true,  the program will call +System.setSecurityManager()+,  if  +System.getSecurityManager() == null+. The security manager subsystem can define the permission block for use by default by the module class loader. * We need to come up with a schema for the permission collection that can be used in the security-manager subsystem. We can use some of the concepts used in the policy file but make it usable. * The permission collection generated in the SM subsystem needs to be available to the module classloader if explicit permission collection not defined in module.xml for the module in question. To summarize the options, the following systems will need to be configured with permissions: a) JVM Bootstrap b) JBoss Modules Bootstrap c) JBoss Application Server h2. Module Permission Collection module.xml will have a permission collection block that mirrors what is defined in the security-manager subsystem of the domain model. This is what the module classloader will pick up. If left undefined, the global permission collection from the security-manager domain model will be adopted. h2. Deployment Permission Collection EE7 deployments can define a permission collection via META-INF/permissions.xml   We will need to merge/adapt/convert this into a module level permission collection at the class loader for the deployment. h2.

Chat Dumps h3. h3. 21 Feb 2013 (09:27:03 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: working on the wiki article that outlines a plan.  I am unsure yet that we need a policy implementation. (09:27:16 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: but look at my article in about an hour.  then we can talk.* * (09:31:39 AM) dmlloyd: okay.  I came up with a few more ideas before I fell asleep last night* * (09:42:28 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: saw your posts last night. I did make a post close to midnight. (09:42:30 AM) asaldhan:  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-48386 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AS8JBossSecurityManagerImplementationPlan (09:42:40 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: it is half written.  adding details now.* * (09:44:23 AM) dmlloyd: asaldhan, I figured out that in JBoss Modules I can wrap the system Policy with one that grants modules itself AllPermission and that gets around the boot issue (09:44:41 AM) dmlloyd: so basically if you pass -secmgr to JBoss Modules at boot, you're fully secured (09:44:56 AM) dmlloyd: I know that doesn't answer any of the other questions though (09:45:16 AM) dmlloyd: but at least it's one less headache  :) (09:45:25 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: I like the programmatic option wherein JVM and Modules bootstrapped before SM kicks in (09:45:38 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: unless the admin is paranoid, then he can go the command line way (09:46:12 AM) dmlloyd: the problem is that it comes in so late (09:46:50 AM) dmlloyd: one thing to consider though is that we have a few places where we want to administratively configure stuff that needs to take effect at or near JVM startup (09:47:26 AM) dmlloyd: so secmgr is not unique in that regard (09:48:00 AM) dmlloyd: so it's possible that even with the command line switch, the subsystem can still control it* * (09:48:43 AM) dmlloyd: now, all that said, I think the programmatic option is still viable (09:49:10 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: from admin perspective, they usually trust JVM and core JBoss infrastructure. (09:49:27 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: it is the applications that get deployed on the runtime that can go berseck (09:49:49 AM) ***asaldhan has updated the article* * (09:51:05 AM) dmlloyd: asaldhan: that is true (09:51:22 AM) dmlloyd: tbh all of my changes should be able to support programmatic SM enablement later on (09:52:16 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: in my view 95% of usecases will go by programmatic approach.  for the paranoid, the cmd line option can go (09:52:27 AM) dmlloyd: we could cut down significantly on startup time this way (09:52:41 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: right. (09:52:55 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: what I feel is the flag   "enable=true"  which kicks in the SM (09:53:00 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: usability will be cool (09:53:24 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: by default, the permissions should be DenyAll  as long as all the modules shipped in AS8 have allperm in module.xml (09:53:32 AM) dmlloyd: that flag should be "enable=(true|false|inherit)" though - otherwise if they set it on the command line and it's set to "false" then the SM will turn off once the subsystem kicks in  :) (09:53:37 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: that way, admin has to configure his apps and custom modules (09:53:49 AM) dmlloyd: asaldhan, the EE spec gives a minimum permission set actually (09:53:56 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: right (09:54:25 AM) dmlloyd: I wonder if we should automatically set those up or if the EE perm set should just be the default* * (09:57:42 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: what I am wondering is by default,  there should be no SM.  Just a Policy implementation for modules  that does policy.implies(permission) check for sensitive operations (09:58:07 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: this is more of a JBoss modules concept that will be extended to the AS8 server (09:58:46 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: there really is no major need for SM to be ON vmwide (09:59:17 AM) dmlloyd: most things which check permissions will skip the check if there's no SM (09:59:33 AM) dmlloyd: check out these changes though: (09:59:35 AM) dmlloyd:  http://github.com/jbossas/jboss-modules/compare/c217927...a6345ca http://github.com/jbossas/jboss-modules/compare/c217927...a6345ca (09:59:42 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: will check the changes. (09:59:44 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: BUT (09:59:45 AM) dmlloyd: these should allow a SM to be turned on later (10:00:04 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: it is the modules codebase that can do policy.implies for many of its operations. (10:00:23 AM) dmlloyd: it could, but to what purpose?* * (10:01:11 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: your changes was what I was mentioning about the policy (10:02:33 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: you need the SM for policing n/w operations, socket ops, IO etc done by the JVM and application code.       But the modules can police some of the classloader checks using modulepolicy when a SM is absent (10:02:35 AM) dmlloyd: ah right, so we're saying the same thing (10:02:48 AM) dmlloyd: okay, that's true (10:03:17 AM) dmlloyd: but I don't think it's too necessary as there aren't too many actual privileged operations like that in modules really (10:03:35 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: ModuleCL operations maybe? (10:03:48 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: public private api etc? (10:03:55 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: I am just talking loudly (10:04:01 AM) asaldhan: thinking (10:04:02 AM) dmlloyd: I use access control for most things (10:04:12 AM) dmlloyd: java language access control that is (10:04:29 AM) asaldhan: AccessControlContext? (10:04:34 AM) asaldhan: accesscontroller.doPriv? (10:04:58 AM) dmlloyd: no, private/protected/etc.* * (10:05:34 AM) asaldhan: yeah  but what about cases where in methods are declared public  but they cannot be accessed from outside the module.  Like app classes should not call these.  There is no SM installed.* * (10:06:12 AM) ***asaldhan is looking at a modular system (10:07:17 AM) dmlloyd: I use visibility restriction for those cases (10:12:27 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: one change in your thought.   SM subsystem enable=false  does not disable SM if bootstrapped via cmd line.  It only does System.setSM if enable=true (10:12:58 AM) dmlloyd: how can users turn it off then? (10:19:56 AM) dmlloyd: realistically enabling SM from the cmdline isn't that different from enabling it programmatically (10:19:59 AM) dmlloyd: it just happens sooner (10:20:24 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: we will only ship with programmatic option (10:20:39 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: we may have an article for how to do with cmd line option for paranoid admins (10:21:05 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: the cmd line folks will be less &lt;1% of total users. (10:21:29 AM) dmlloyd: okay so perhaps we can just make it a doc issue (10:21:48 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: management of the SM now becomes part of domain management (10:21:52 AM) dmlloyd: if you turn on SM on the command line, you must remember to have it on in your config as well (10:21:58 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: rather than mucking with cmd files (10:22:14 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: cmd line turn on will have the steps in the document. (10:22:45 AM) dmlloyd: one other concern is that we have to make sure that our service dependencies do not allow deployments to start up before the sec mgr subsystem kicks in* * (10:23:26 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd:  how quickly can the sec mgr subsystem kick in?  will the service dependency resolution happen before that?* * (10:24:53 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: the flow should be (JVM)---&gt; (Modules Bootstrap)----&gt;SM ----&gt; everything else (10:28:09 AM) dmlloyd: all subsystems will begin initializing at the same time (10:28:39 AM) dmlloyd: deployments should not start up until all the subsystems do, but that's something definitely to verify (10:28:52 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: should the SM subsystem be part of the modules bootstrap? (10:29:20 AM) dmlloyd: if we do that we'll break all kinds of things - I don't think we want to open that door just yet (10:29:29 AM) dmlloyd: in AS 9 we may have some better options though... (10:35:41 AM) dmlloyd: one note for the future... the sec mgr subsystem is clearly something that is not applicable to embedded servers (10:36:05 AM) dmlloyd: I think at some point we'll have to go through and specify what subsystems apply to embedded, jvm, or both* * (10:36:18 AM) dmlloyd: I can easily imagine special embedded-specific subsystems (10:37:35 AM) dmlloyd: well *parts* of the sec mgr subsys anyway (10:37:56 AM) dmlloyd: for example in embedded you can't be installing SMs, but you can for example assign permissions to deployment modules (10:44:53 AM) asaldhan: dmlloyd: The module system can definitely be doing a lot of Policy.implies checks if it desires.  :) * * (10:49:18 AM) dmlloyd: okay, so I think we're pretty well sorted out on that score (10:57:15 AM) dmlloyd: the last discussion for SM is, what do we need to configure in the domain, and how will it look (10:57:26 AM) dmlloyd: use cases -&gt; requirements -&gt; design (11:27:42 AM) dmlloyd: I guess the questions are: (11:28:04 AM) dmlloyd: 1) do we configure a maximal permission set globally for all deployments? (11:28:12 AM) dmlloyd: 2) do we do the same for deployments based on some pattern? (11:28:51 AM) dmlloyd: 3) what about extensions/filesystem JARs?</body>

    <body>Thanks for the response. The two external files are used to confiure the server. One thing of greater importance to me is *serveServletsByClassnameEnabled="true"* *How do I enable this in JBoss AS7 ?* This is a Java Web application that was started 10 years ago and uses the above configuration to serve all the servlets. This alleviates the need to map servlets in web.xml. If com.adcd.SnoopServlet needs to be called, the request would be like  http://domain/webcontext/ http://domain/webcontext/*servlet/com.adcd.SnoopServlet* will be served. Since we are porting we really do not want to change much. How do we acheive this in JBoss AS7? Is there something that can be configured in web.xml to acheive this? * *</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - AS8: JBoss Security Manager Implementation Plan</header>
    <body>No, actually.  The user just adds the module like normal.  The default module properties are "AllPermission" but you can specify a more restrictive set in the module.xml file.  The reason we went away from signing is that it doesn't really afford any more security - if you have access to the filesystem, you can make the AS run without a security manager anyway. It is also possible to further restrict permissions using the JDK's default policy mechanism.  The effective permissions are the intersection of the module specified permissions and the global policy.  But it is designed so that a policy file is not required in the simplest case. Finally we will have *some* mechanism (not yet determined) to specify a policy that applies to deployments.</body>

    <body>I finally found the reason for the error I was getting. Approach #2 is actually as simple as written above, binding to the same address(es) but different ports does work. But there is of course more than one place in which you can specify ports that an instance should use. I had a remote debugging port specified in the JVM parameters under [JBOSS_HOME]/bin/standalone.conf. I changed this port as well in the second instance, and now it starts smoothly.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - secureResponse called before service invocation instead of after</header>
    <body>WebJASPIAuthenticator in JBoss AS 7.1.1 and JBoss EAP 6.0.1 calls +secureResponse+ right after +validateRequest+ on a SAM has been called. The only intermediate code is registering the result of the callback handler with the container. The service invocation (e.g. calling a Servlet) is done afterwards, ie after the call to +secureResponse+. See the following fragment:         // the authentication process has been a success. We need to register the principal, username, password and roles         // with the container             // get the client principal from the callback.             // if the client principal is not a jboss generic principal, we need to build one before registering.             if (!(clientPrincipal instanceof JBossGenericPrincipal))             this.register(request, response, clientPrincipal, authMethod, pvc.getUsername(),             if (this.secureResponse) However, section 3.8.3.3 of the JSR 196 (JASPIC) spec says that the semantics of secureResponse are as defined in Section 3.8.2.2, which thus means that secureResponse should be called +after+ a service invocation. Figure 1.1 in Section 1.1 shows this as well, and the general flow as described is Section 3.8 also mentions this. So, in JBoss the sequence is validateRequest -&gt; secureResponse -&gt; Invoke Service While the spec seems to say it should be: validateRequest -&gt; Invoke Service -&gt; secureResponse In the reference implementation GlassFish the sequence is indeed the latter one.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Remote EJB distributed transactions and recovery</header>
    <body>h1. Overview Unlike previous JBoss AS versions, remote transaction propagation between 2 server instances for EJB invocations does *not* require JTS. EJB client API which was introduced in AS7 uses its own protocol for remote transaction propagation between the client and the server for EJB invocations. h1. Typical scenario Let's consider an EJB A hosted on Server 1 and EJB B hosted on Server 2. EJBs are transactional by default. There are ways to disable transactions on EJBs or certain business methods of EJBs. But we won't be going into that part, in this article because our intention is to focus on the transaction propagation and recovery for EJBs, which obviously will require transactional EJBs. When a client, for example a standalone Java application, invokes on EJB A (on Server 1) a transaction is created. Later, during that invocation request, if EJB A in turn invokes on EJB B (on Server 2), the transaction propagation is carried out between the servers hosting those 2 EJBs. Previous versions of JBoss AS require JTS for the transaction propagation to happen. However in AS7 we have a JBoss specific protocol implemented in EJB client API which does the necessary propagation. The EJB client API interacts with the transaction manager on Server 1 and Server 2 to carry out the necessary transaction propagation and management. Furthermore on the server side of the interaction (i.e. of Server 2 in this case), the AS7 EJB integration layer (heavily) uses JBoss Transaction project (Narayana) APIs to import the remote transaction and further manage it. h1. Crash and transaction recovery JBoss Transactions (Narayana) project provides the necessary API infrastructure for libraries like the EJB client API project to integrate for transaction recovery in case of client/server crash scenarios. The design of that API is explained in the JBoss Transactions project manual here  http://docs.jboss.org/jbosstm/4.17.3.Final/guides/failure_recovery_guide/ http://docs.jboss.org/jbosstm/4.17.3.Final/guides/failure_recovery_guide/. /** * Obtains a list of prepared transaction branches from a resource manager. The transaction manager calls this method * during recovery to obtain the list of transaction branches that are currently in prepared or heuristically completed states. */ As is evident from the name of the method, the implementation is responsible for returning the Xid(s) which need to be recovered. h1. XAResourceRecovery implementation for EJB client API As explained in the JBoss Transactions document, the recovery process involves a background thread which runs at periodic intervals to check for transactions that should be recovered. From a EJB client API perspective, it has to know the target server against which it is issuing a recover request and also the node identifier of the node/server on which the (previously run) transaction(s) originated. h2. Node identifier of the transaction origin This is also known as the "parent node name". This is the node on which the transaction, which was propagated, originated. The transaction subsystem integration in AS7 exposes this node identifier via the CoreEnvironmentService:   ...   .... So it's straightforward for the EJB client integration in AS7 to know what the node identifier of itself. h2. Target server(s)/EJBReceiver(s) against which the recover request has to be issued The EJBClientContext can potentially contain numerous EJBReceiver(s), each of which correspond to a different node. Furthermore, the EJBReceiver(s) within a EJBClientContext can be dynamic - which means at it may not always contain the same set of EJBReceiver(s). Certain receivers may be added or removed as and when such a need arises. As such, there's no fixed set of EJBReceiver(s) which the EJBClientContext can known before hand to issue the recovery request against. So how does the EJB client API know which EJBReceiver(s) should it issue the recovery request when the recovery manager background process asks it for the Xid[] that need to be recovered. The answer to that question is that whenever a EJBReceiver is registered in a EJBClientContext, it will make that EJBReceiver eligible for issuing a recovery request against. This is a very important thing to remember since if a server/EJBReceiver was being used during EJB invocations and either the server or client crashed, then the recovery against the server/EJBReceiver will not be triggered unless that EJBReceiver gets registered within a EJBClientContext. This however isn't a restriction since a recovery process between 2 servers only makes sense when they are communicating with each other and from a EJB client API perspective, the communication can only happen when the EJBReceiver is registered in a EJBClientContext.</body>

All of the details being discussed in this article will be implemented in a way such that the AS7 EJB integration part can provide the necessary plugins to the EJB client library for allowing the recovery process to be carried out.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>Sorry David, for not replying long ago. I'm fine with a disabling mechanism, particularly if it's ok to undo the change on a patch rollback. My inclination is to add a UI element such that we warn the user of the presence of this kind of change and require them to pass a flag allowing it. It's less critical that we do that if we allow re-enabling on rollback. But it may still be nice as it will help avoid suprises, e.g. if the disabled jar was on a classpath. As for RPM, +1. I want the approach we follow here to be generally consistent with RPM patching, so a user who is familiar with RPM will have a general sense of how what we're doing will behave, and so a user who is accustomed to this tool who then moves to RPM is reasonably comfortable. As for actually using this tool on an installation that was provisioned via RPM -- that was not part of the original requirements for the tool. I would want to hear a clear example of how the two could mix and what the benefits would be before I'd go to my management to look into getting resources to make that happen.</body>

    <body>bad idea to reimplement XA Transaction handling just for two servers and one specific EJB client API, when you have a separate project specialised for complex problem like XA two face commit. Typically you don't have just two servers for XA recovery but, often XA Transaction is spawn over TXT Datasource(s) which interact also with TX Manager from DB. Or if you have JMS Ressources like Queue or Topic with TXT Connection Factory. What if Stand Alone Client is using EJB API to communicate to a Server A EJB , but this EJB calls Server B EJB over let say iiop...? What if TXT start was issued outside of Server or if Serve A and Server B are back, but the DB is still down.. ?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - TransactionMonitoringAndVisualization</header>
    <body>h1. Transaction Monitoring and Visualization The purpose of this project is to create a tool for monitoring the status of in-flight and complete transactions. The main aims of the tool are to help debug transaction related issues and also to educate the developer of transactional applications. Essentially, the tool monitors a running system and produces a list of all transactions. A user may then select a particular transaction to see in more detail the participants involved in the transaction, the outcome of the transaction and the participants that influenced the outcome. Ideally the tool would be visual, showing a diagramatic view of a transaction. However, early versions may be tabular to allow more time to be spent improving functionality. A few diagrams should give you an idea of what the tooling could produce: https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/20113/TXVisualCommitted%282%29.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/20113/TXVisualCommitted%282%29.png Here we can see that a transaction was begun on Server1. It enlisted a DB and JMS queue locally and invoked a remote service on Server2. A second resource (DB2) was enlisted on Server2. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/20114/TXVisualRollback.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/20114/TXVisualRollback.png In this example we can see that the transaction rolled back because DB2 voted rollback. Other possible features: * *List Transactions*. List all logged transactions with a summary of the outcome (Committed, rolled back, heuristic). * *Multiple Transaction Types.* Somehow depict the type of transaction (JTS, WS-AT, REST-AT, etc) * *Display Bridges*. Display when a transaction is bridged from one type to another * *In flight Transactions*. More useful for long running transactions; display the current status of each participant and update the display in real-time as the status changes. * *Heuristics*. Display any resources that made a heuristic decsion and what that decision was. * *Recovery Status*. Show which resources crashed and the status of those resources already committed or recovered. h4. Potential Solution Use Byteman rules to log the required information on each server. The log can then be parsed by the visualization tool. The benefit of this approach is that you should be able to hook into any code in the TM. Also it it easy to turn on and off the tool so that it doesn't add overhead in production.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Primordial Boot	Options</header>
    <body>On this page I want to lay out some alternative approaches to altering the AS 7.2 / EAP 6.1 boot to realize the objectives discussed in  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927. h2. Primary goals: 1. To support the organization of modules as described on  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927, such that the modules that ship with AS 7.2 comprise the "distribution base" discussed on that document. 2. To ensure that when other valid "layered distributions" or "add-on"s install on top of that AS 7.2 distribution base they can place their modules in appropriate locations as described in  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 and don't need to alter the startup scripts in order to have those modules become visible with the proper precedence. 3. To ensure the the $JBOSS_MODULE_PATH environment variable is left available for use by end users and isn't polluted with the various detailed paths discussed on  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927. h2. Secondary goals: These are things to consider while working to achieve the primary goal: 1. To eliminate as much as possible standard configuration settings from the startup scripts. 2. To organize any remaining script-based standard configuration settings to make them easily usable by tooling. 3. To avoid altering the programmatic launch of the AS such that existing tooling that launches the AS will not need to handle AS 7.2 / EAP 6.1 separately from how previous AS 7.1 / EAP 6.0 was handled. Some of the secondary goals may prove contradictory. h2. Current Boot The critical aspects of our existing launch commands can be boiled down to the following for a standalone  server and a managed domain host respectively: java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.process-controller (The real command uses $JBOSS_HOME to create absolute paths. That is omitted in this document for brevity.) The main() class invoked by the JVM is a JBoss Modules class in jboss-modules.jar. It reads the -mp command line argument to learn that modules are available under filesystem path "modules". It then loads either the org.jboss.as.standalone or the org.jboss.as.process-controller module, finds the class described as the "main" class in that module's module.xml file, loads it and invokes its main() method. h2. Options: The following options for how to do the boot come to mind: h3. Specialized "Main" Modules This the one that's been focused on recently. The org.jboss.as.process-controller and org.jboss.as.standalone modules remain located as they currently are. They do not get placed in modules/layers/base as is described on the Layered Distributions wiki. As a result, a standard jboss-modules boot module loader can find them. The code in those modules, however, changes significantly. Essentially it no longer particular concerns itself with those modules do today. Instead, it's sole concern is to figure out the detailed module path as described on the Layered Distributions wiki. It will figure that out and create a ModuleLoader that follows those rules. Using that ModuleLoader it will then load a *different* module located in modules/layers/base, find its main class, load that class and invoke its main() method. That class will execute the logic found in the current main classes. An advantage to this is the existing programmatic launch command is completely unchanged. The disadvantage is we leave modules located directly under modules. These modules have to be handled different from other modules, however. You can't override them in a patch via a different module. Instead the patch tool has to treat them as a bunch miscellaneous files (like it treats jboss-modules.jar.) This is mildly annoying because they are a special case for the patch generation and application tools. Also RPMs for layered products will have to account for these modules separately; they can't just create a simple symlink to the EAP RPM's modules/layers/base to pick up all the base modules. With this approach there will likely be at least 3 of these specialized modules directly under modules/ -- org.jboss.as.standalone, org.jboss.as.process-controller and a 3rd, e.g org.jboss.as.boot, that contains the most of the code. The bulk of the code is common between the other two. h3. Single Specialized "Main" Modules This is a variant on the previous approach. The launch command becomes: java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.boot org.jboss.as.standalone The goal here is to reduce the number of specialized "Main" modules to just one -- org.jboss.as.boot. It reads the next argument in the command (e.g. org.jboss.as.standalone) and uses it to decide what module to invoke. This makes things a bit less messy in the modules/ dir but at the cost of changing the launch command. h3. h3. Specialized JBoss AS Boot Module Loader This is the approach that was being followed on the initial work for the patching feature. The command becomes: java -cp jboss-modules.jar:jboss-as-loader.jar -Dboot.module.loader=org.jboss.as.boot.ModuleLoader -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone The AS ships a jar "jboss-as-loader.jar" alongside jboss-modules.jar. The launch command places that jar on the classpath. JBoss Modules uses system property "boot.module.loader" to discover the classname of the ModuleLoader implementation it should use. The implementation the AS provides understands all the rules in the Layered Distributions wiki. The downsides are an extra file in the root of the AS distribution and a change in the launch command. h3. New Main Class The AS stops using JBoss Modules as its main class. Instead we create our own main class, which does preliminary setup work and then calls JBoss Modules' main() class. The launch command becomes: java -cp jboss-modules.jar:jboss-as-boot.jar -jar jboss-as-boot.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone Again, the downsides are an extra file in the root of the AS distribution and a change in the launch command. A positive to this is the new main class can take over some processing that's currently done in the scripts. For example, including org.jboss.byteman in system property jboss.modules.system.pkgs. Also the -P processing requested at https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODULES-117 could be done without requiring it to be added into jboss-modules itself. h3. New Main Class with Shading This is the same as the "New Main Class" approach, except we shade jboss-modules.jar into jboss-as-boot.jar in order to eliminate a jar. Launch command becomes: java -jar jboss-as-boot.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone Still a change in launch command though. The only way to get around the change in the launch command would be to call this shaded jar "jboss-modules.jar" which would be very, very ugly.</body>

    <body>I like the "New Main Class" idea.  I don't see the extra file in the root as a big problem.   And I don't think the complexity of the final command matters at all because it is hidden from 99.999% of users. But anything you can remove from the script means you can potentially remove it in several files: standalone.bat, standalone.sh, domain.bat, and domain.sh.  That seems like a big win. -1 on the shading though.  I'd rather keep the ability to update/replace the two jars independently.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Using the CLI remote	client jar</header>
    <body>If you want to connect to a remote JBoss AS7 instance without installing AS7 on your local machine, you can use the CLI remote client jar.  It is called *jboss-cli-client.jar* and it is located in &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/client. The *jboss-cli-client jar* can be used to remotely manage a JBoss AS instance with CLI or jconsole.  Copy jboss-cli-client.jar to your client machine.  Even though the jboss-cli-client jar was added starting with AS7.2, it still works with older AS7 versions.  So it's a good way to get the benefit of the latest CLI code. h3. To Run CLI using jboss-cli-client.jar java -jar &lt;PATH TO jboss-cli-client.jar&gt; [--help] [--version] [--controller=host:port]                                          [--gui] [--connect] [--file=file_path]                                          [--commands=command_or_operation1,command_or_operation2...]                                          [--command=command_or_operation]                                          [--user=username --password=password] Use --help for an explanation of the CLI command line options.  h3. To Run jconsole using jboss-cli-client.jar jconsole -J-Djava.class.path=&lt;PATH TO jconsole.jar&gt;;&lt;PATH TO tools.jar&gt;;&lt;PATH TO jboss-cli-client.jar&gt; Path to jconsole.jar and tools.jar is typically &lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;/lib/jconsole.jar and &lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;/lib/tools.jar.</body>

    <body>The complexity of the command isn't really an issue. It's changing it at all that is more of a concern. Lots of tooling programatically launches an AS -- think IDEs, profilers, JON, etc. Some of those tools are sponsored by Red Hat and we can readily enough reach out to them to get them to support a different launch variation (after letting them pummel us a while.) But for many others we may have no idea they even exist.</body>

    <body>Hi, I have a jBPM5 (5.2.0) application running on jboss-as-7.0.2.Final which came with the jBPM-5.2.0 installer. I want to deploy this application on JBoss AS 7 (GateIn-3.5.0.Final-jbossas7). But AS 7.1.1 doesnt come with jBPM. Is there any way i can configure jBPM5 with JBoss AS 7.1.1? Appreciate any pointers/ suggestions on how I can go about this. Thanks!</body>

    <body>I see your point now.   It's hard to know if the trade-off is worth the pummeling.  I think I'd be willing to take a few lumps if we think "New Main Class" is a better solution.  We took a much bigger hit when we got rid of run.bat.  But we survived and thrived.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Primordial Boot	Options</header>
    <body>On this page I want to lay out some alternative approaches to altering the AS 7.2 / EAP 6.1 boot to realize the objectives discussed in  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927. h2. Primary goals: 1. To support the organization of modules as described on  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927, such that the modules that ship with AS 7.2 comprise the "distribution base" discussed on that document. 2. To ensure that when other valid "layered distributions" or "add-on"s install on top of that AS 7.2 distribution base they can place their modules in appropriate locations as described in  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 and don't need to alter the startup scripts in order to have those modules become visible with the proper precedence. 3. To ensure the the $JBOSS_MODULE_PATH environment variable is left available for use by end users and isn't polluted with the various detailed paths discussed on  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47927. h2. Secondary goals: These are things to consider while working to achieve the primary goal: 1. To eliminate as much as possible standard configuration settings from the startup scripts. 2. To organize any remaining script-based standard configuration settings to make them easily usable by tooling. 3. To avoid altering the programmatic launch of the AS such that existing tooling that launches the AS will not need to handle AS 7.2 / EAP 6.1 separately from how previous AS 7.1 / EAP 6.0 was handled. Some of the secondary goals may prove contradictory. h2. Current Boot The critical aspects of our existing launch commands can be boiled down to the following for a standalone  server and a managed domain host respectively: java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.process-controller (The real command uses $JBOSS_HOME to create absolute paths. That is omitted in this document for brevity.) The main() class invoked by the JVM is a JBoss Modules class in jboss-modules.jar. It reads the -mp command line argument to learn that modules are available under filesystem path "modules". It then loads either the org.jboss.as.standalone or the org.jboss.as.process-controller module, finds the class described as the "main" class in that module's module.xml file, loads it and invokes its main() method. h2. Options: The following options for how to do the boot come to mind: h3. Include the layering logic within JBoss Modules If JBoss Modules natively supported the layering rules, this would be simplest. The AS could simply reorganize its module directory layout and it would just work. This is the current plan (Jan 18, 2013). The layering rules and patching mechanism we propose for the AS are a valid general set of behavior that any complex application built on jboss-modules might want to take advantage of, so David will build it in. h3. Specialized "Main" Modules This one was the initial focus but has proved impractical. It involves having most AS modules no longer loaded by the JBoss Modules "boot module loader"; the boot module loader simply loads 1 module which creates a different ModuleLoader to load everything else. But I count 59 spots in the AS code base where the code is accessing Module.getBootModuleLoader(), most, perhaps all of which would break with this approach. This the one that's been focused on recently. The org.jboss.as.process-controller and org.jboss.as.standalone modules remain located as they currently are. They do not get placed in modules/layers/base as is described on the Layered Distributions wiki. As a result, a standard jboss-modules boot module loader can find them. The code in those modules, however, changes significantly. Essentially it no longer particular concerns itself with those modules do today. Instead, it's sole concern is to figure out the detailed module path as described on the Layered Distributions wiki. It will figure that out and create a ModuleLoader that follows those rules. Using that ModuleLoader it will then load a *different* module located in modules/layers/base, find its main class, load that class and invoke its main() method. That class will execute the logic found in the current main classes. An advantage to this is the existing programmatic launch command is completely unchanged. The disadvantage is we leave modules located directly under modules. These modules have to be handled different from other modules, however. You can't override them in a patch via a different module. Instead the patch tool has to treat them as a bunch miscellaneous files (like it treats jboss-modules.jar.) This is mildly annoying because they are a special case for the patch generation and application tools. Also RPMs for layered products will have to account for these modules separately; they can't just create a simple symlink to the EAP RPM's modules/layers/base to pick up all the base modules. With this approach there will likely be at least 3 of these specialized modules directly under modules/ -- org.jboss.as.standalone, org.jboss.as.process-controller and a 3rd, e.g org.jboss.as.boot, that contains the most of the code. The bulk of the code is common between the other two. h3. Single Specialized "Main" Module No longer under consideration for the same reason as the previous option. This is a variant on the previous approach. The launch command becomes: java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.boot org.jboss.as.standalone The goal here is to reduce the number of specialized "Main" modules to just one -- org.jboss.as.boot. It reads the next argument in the command (e.g. org.jboss.as.standalone) and uses it to decide what module to invoke. This makes things a bit less messy in the modules/ dir but at the cost of changing the launch command. h3. h3. Specialized JBoss AS Boot Module Loader This is the approach that was being followed on the initial work for the patching feature. The command becomes: java -cp jboss-modules.jar:jboss-as-loader.jar -Dboot.module.loader=org.jboss.as.boot.ModuleLoader -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone The AS ships a jar "jboss-as-loader.jar" alongside jboss-modules.jar. The launch command places that jar on the classpath. JBoss Modules uses system property "boot.module.loader" to discover the classname of the ModuleLoader implementation it should use. The implementation the AS provides understands all the rules in the Layered Distributions wiki. The downsides are an extra file in the root of the AS distribution and a change in the launch command. h3. New Main Class The AS stops using JBoss Modules as its main class. Instead we create our own main class, which does preliminary setup work and then calls JBoss Modules' main() class. The launch command becomes: java -cp jboss-modules.jar:jboss-as-boot.jar -jar jboss-as-boot.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone Again, the downsides are an extra file in the root of the AS distribution and a change in the launch command. A positive to this is the new main class can take over some processing that's currently done in the scripts. For example, including org.jboss.byteman in system property jboss.modules.system.pkgs. Also the -P processing requested at  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODULES-117 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODULES-117 could be done without requiring it to be added into jboss-modules itself. h3. New Main Class with Shading This is the same as the "New Main Class" approach, except we shade jboss-modules.jar into jboss-as-boot.jar in order to eliminate a jar. Launch command becomes: java -jar jboss-as-boot.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone Still a change in launch command though. The only way to get around the change in the launch command would be to call this shaded jar "jboss-modules.jar" which would be very, very ugly.</body>

    <body>Hi,      I referred the AdministrationGuide.pdf for clustered environment, but i didn't get clear idea about configuring clustered environment.     Actually i need to put my application in a clustered enviroment for load balancing purpose, so that if i get large request to my jboss esb means i need to redirect the request to another jboss server that mapped with in the clustered environment.     Can anyone give a sample configuration files or a proper guide for configuring the clustered environment in jboss esb service(I am using jbossesb-server-4.10).

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Detyped Description of the AS 7 Management Model</header>
    <body>h3. Deprecated, see https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Description+of+the+Management+Mode (https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Description+of+the+Management+Model)l instead AS 7's management API will naturally include the ability for clients to query the management system to discover meta-information about the management model; i.e. what resources are available and what attributes and operations they expose. These details will be returned in a detyped form, either using the  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-dmr jboss-dmr library or JSON. (A JMX interface based on open mbeans will also be provided; most concepts in this article map naturally to JMX.) The purpose of this article is to describe the detyped representation of the API. Readers are encouraged to look at the example detyped descriptions of parts of the management API at the bottom before reading the details. Before getting into the details of the meta-information, first a couple quick examples on how to access it. h5. Reading Management Model Descriptions via the raw Management API The client must have maven artifact org.jboss.as:jboss-as-controller-client and its dependencies on the classpath. 1) Create a management client that can connect to your target process's native management socket (which can be an individual standalone mode server, or, in a domain mode environment, the Domain Controller or any Host Controller: The address and port are what is configured in the target process' &lt;management-apis&gt;&lt;native-api.../&gt; element. 2) Create an operation request object using the org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode class: See   https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16336 http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16336 for basic background on the format of an operation request. The key thing here is we are executing the "read-resource-description" operation. That operation can be targetted at any address in the management model; here we are targetting it at the resource for the web subsystem's http connector. The request includes two optional parameters: * recursive -- true means you want the description of child resources under this resource. Default is false * operations -- true means you want the description of operations exposed by the resource to be included. Default is false. 3) Execute the operation and manipulate the result: See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16354 http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16354 for general details on the structure of the "returnVal" ModelNode. h5. Reading Management Model Descriptions via the CLI See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16581 http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16581 for basics on using the CLI. Once you've launched the CLI the syntax for the command shown above would be: [localhost:9999 /] /subsystem=web/connector=http:read-resource-description(recursive=true,operations=true) h3. h3. Description of addressable portions of the management model All portions of the management model exposed by AS 7 are addressable via an ordered list of key/value pairs. For each addressable portion of the model, the following descriptive information will be available: * description -- String -- text description of this portion of the model * head-comment-allowed -- boolean -- indicates whether this portion of the model can store an XML comment that would be written in the persistent form of the model (e.g. domain.xml) before the start of the XML element that represents this portion of the model. This item is optional, and if not present defaults to true. +*(Note: storing XML comments in the in-memory model is not currently supported and likely will not be supported in AS 7.1. This description key is for future use.)*+ * tail-comment-allowed -- boolean -- similar to head-comment-allowed, but indicates whether a comment just before the close of the XML element is supported. A tail comment can only be supported if the element has child elements, in which case a comment can be inserted between the final child element and the element's closing tag. This item is optional, and if not present defaults to true. +*(Note: storing XML comments in the in-memory model is not currently supported and likely will not be supported in AS 7.1. This description key is for future use.)*+ * attributes -- Map of String (the attribute name) to complex structure -- the configuration attributes available in this portion of the model. See below for the representation of each attribute. * operations -- Map of String (the operation name) to complex structure -- the operations that can be targetted at this address. See below for the representation of each operation. * children -- Map of String (the type of child) to complex structure -- the relationship of this portion of the model to other addressable portions of the model. See below for the representation of each child relationship.      "description =&gt; "A managable resource",      "tail-comment-allowed" =&gt; false,                .... details of attribute foo                .... details of the start operation                .... details of the relationship with children of type "bar" h4. Description of an Attribute An attribute is a portion of the management model that is not directly addressable. Instead, it is conceptually a property of an addressable part of the model. For each attribute portion of the model, the following descriptive information will be available: * description -- String -- text description of the attribute * type -- org.jboss.dmr.ModelType -- the type of the attribute value. One of the enum values BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LIST, LONG, OBJECT, PROPERTY, STRING. Most of these are self-explanatory. An OBJECT will be represented in the detyped model as a map of string keys to values of some other legal type, conceptually similar to a javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData. A PROPERTY is a single key/value pair, where the key is a string, and the value is of some other legal type. * value-type -- ModelType or complex structure -- Only present if type is LIST or OBJECT. If type is LIST or all the values of the OBJECT type are of the same type, this will be one of the ModelType enums  BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT,  LONG, STRING. Otherwise, value-type will detail the structure of the attribute value, enumerating the value's fields and the type of their value. * required -- boolean -- true if the attribute will always exist in a representation of its portion of the model; false if it may not (implying a null value.) If not present, true is the default. * storage -- String -- Either "configuration" or "runtime". If "configuration" it means the attribute's value is stored as part of the persistent configuration (e.g. in domain.xml, host.xml or standalone.xml.) If "runtime" the attribute's value is not stored in the persistent configuration; the value only exists as long as the resource is running. * access-type -- String -- One of "read-only", "read-write" or "metric". Whether an attribute value can be written, or can only read. A "metric" is a read-only attribute whose value is not stored in the persistent configuration, and whose value may change due to activity on the server. If an attribute is "read-write", the resource will expose an operation named "write-attribute" whose "name" parameter will accept this attribute's name and whose "value" parameter will accept a valid value for this attribute. That operation will be the standard means of updating this attribute's value. * restart-required -- String -- One of "no-services", "all-services", "resource-services" or "jvm". Only relevant to attributes whose access-type is read-write. Indicates whether execution of a write-attribute operation whose name parameter specifies this attribute requires a restart of services (or an entire JVM) in order for the change to take effect in the runtime . See discussion of "Applying Updates to Runtime Services" below.  Default value is "no-services". * alternatives -- List of string -- Indicates an exclusive relationship between attributes. If this attribute is defined, the other attributes listed in this descriptor's value should be undefined (even if their required descriptor says true; i.e. the presence of this attribute satisfies the requirement.) Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most attributes. * requires -- List of string -- Indicates that if this attribute has a value (other than undefined), the other attributes listed in this descriptor's value must also have a value, even if their required descriptor says false. This would typically be used in conjunction with alternatives. For example, attributes "a" and "b" are required, but are alternatives to each other; "c" and "d" are optional. But "b" requires "c" and "d", so if "b" is used, "c" and "d" must also be defined. Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most attributes. * head-comment-allowed -- boolean -- indicates whether the model can store an XML comment that would be written in the persistent form of the model (e.g. domain.xml) before the start of the XML element that represents this attribute. This item is optional, and if not present defaults to *false*. (This is a different default from is used for an addressable portion of the model, since model attributes often map to XML attributes, which don't allow comments.) +*(Note: storing XML comments in the in-memory model is not currently supported and likely will not be supported in AS 7.1. This description key is for future use.)*+ * tail-comment-allowed -- boolean -- similar to head-comment-allowed, but indicates whether a comment just before the close of the XML element is supported. A tail comment can only be supported if the element has child elements, in which case a comment can be inserted between the final child element and the element's closing tag. This item is optional, and if not present defaults to *false*. (This is a different default from is used for an addressable portion of the model, since model attributes often map to XML attributes, which don't allow comments.) +*(Note: storing XML comments in the in-memory model is not currently supported and likely will not be supported in AS 7.1. This description key is for future use.)*+ * arbitrary key/value pairs that further describe the attribute value, e.g. "max" =&gt; 2. See "Arbitrary Descriptors" below.      "description" =&gt; "The foo",      "type" =&gt; INT,      "max" =&gt; 2      "description" =&gt; "The bar",      "type" =&gt; OBJECT,           "size" =&gt; INT,           "color" =&gt; STRING h3. Description of an Operation An addressable portion of the model may have operations associated with it. The description of an operation will include the following information: * operation-name -- String -- the name of the operation * description -- String -- text description of the operation * request-properties -- Map of String to complex structure -- description of the parameters of the operation. Keys are the names of the parameters, values are descriptions of the parameter value types. See below for details on the description of parameter value types. * reply-properties -- complex structure, or empty -- description of the return value of the operation, with an empty node meaning void. * restart-required -- String -- One of "no-services", "all-services", "resource-services" or "jvm". Indicates whether the operation makes a configuration change that requires a restart of services (or an entire JVM) in order for the change to take effect in the runtime. See discussion of "Applying Updates to Runtime Services" below.  Default value is "no-services". h4. Description of an Operation Parameter or Return Value * description -- String -- text description of the parameter or return value * type -- org.jboss.dmr.ModelType -- the type of the parameter or return value. One of the enum values BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LIST, LONG, OBJECT, PROPERTY, STRING. * value-type -- ModelType or complex structure -- Only present if type is LIST or OBJECT. If type is LIST or all the values of the OBJECT type are of the same type, this will be one of the ModelType enums  BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LIST, LONG, PROPERTY, STRING. Otherwise, value-type will detail the structure of the attribute value, enumerating the value's fields and the type of their value. * value-type -- ModelType or complex structure -- Only present if type is LIST or OBJECT. If type is LIST or all the values of the OBJECT type are of the same type, this will be one of the ModelType enums  BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT,  LONG, STRING. Otherwise, value-type will detail the structure of the attribute value, enumerating the value's fields and the type of their value. * required -- boolean -- Only relevant to parameters. true if the parameter must be present in the request object used to invoke the operation; false if it can omitted. If not present, true is the default. * nillable -- boolean -- true if null is a valid value.  If not present, false is the default. * restart-required -- String -- One of "no-services", "all-services", "resource-services" or "jvm". Only relevant to attributes whose access-type is read-write. Indicates whether execution of a write-attribute operation whose name parameter specifies this attribute requires a restart of services (or an entire JVM) in order for the change to take effect in the runtime . See discussion of "Applying Updates to Runtime Services" below.  Default value is "no-services". * alternatives -- List of string -- Indicates an exclusive relationship between parameters. If this attribute is defined, the other parameters listed in this descriptor's value should be undefined (even if their required descriptor says true; i.e. the presence of this parameter satisfies the requirement.) Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most parameters. * requires -- List of string -- Indicates that if this parameter has a value (other than undefined), the other parameters listed in this descriptor's value must also have a value, even if their required descriptor says false. This would typically be used in conjunction with alternatives. For example, parameters "a" and "b" are required, but are alternatives to each other; "c" and "d" are optional. But "b" requires "c" and "d", so if "b" is used, "c" and "d" must also be defined. Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most parameters. * arbitrary key/value pairs that further describe the attribute value, e.g. "max" =&gt;2. See "Arbitrary Descriptors" below.      "operation-name" =&gt; "incrementFoo",      "description" =&gt; "Increase the value of the 'foo' attribute by the given amount",                "type" =&gt; INT,                "description" =&gt; "The amount to increment",                "required" =&gt; true                "type" =&gt; INT,                "description" =&gt; "The new value",      "operation-name" =&gt; "start",      "description" =&gt; "Starts the thing", h2. Arbitrary Descriptors The description of an attribute, operation parameter or operation return value type can include arbitrary key/value pairs that provide extra information. Whether a particular key/value pair is present depends on the context, e.g. a pair with key "max" would probably only occur as part of the description of some numeric type. Following are standard keys and their expected value type. If descriptor authors want to add an arbitrary key/value pair to some descriptor and the semantic matches the meaning of one of the following items, the standard key/value type must be used. * min -- int -- the minimum value of some numeric type. The absence of this item implies there is no minimum value. * max -- int -- the maximum value of some numeric type. The absence of this item implies there is no maximum value. * min-length -- int -- the minimum length of some string, list or byte[] type. The absence of this item implies a minimum length of zero. * max-length -- int -- the maximum length of some string, list or byte[]. The absence of this item implies there is no maximum value. * nillable -- boolean -- whether null is a legal value. The absence of this item implies false; i.e. null is not a legal value. * allowed -- List -- a list of legal values. The type of the elements in the list should match the type of the attribute. * default -- the default value for the attribute if not present in the model * unit - The unit of the value - e.g. ns, ms, s, m, h, KB, MB, TB. See *Measurement Units* below. h4. Measurement Units Wherever possible, the description of an attribute, operation parameter or operation return value should include the unit arbitrary descriptor. Valid values for this descriptor are: // Simple Unit Types NONE PERCENTAGE // Absolute Sizes in Bytes (utilization) BYTES KILOBYTES MEGABYTES GIGABYTES TERABYTES PETABYTES // Absolute Sizes in Bits (throughput) BITS KILOBITS MEGABITS GIGABITS TERABITS PETABITS // Absolute Time - no display, only hints to the UI how to display EPOCH_MILLISECONDS EPOCH_SECONDS // Relative Time JIFFYS NANOSECONDS MICROSECONDS MILLISECONDS SECONDS MINUTES HOURS DAYS // Rate PER_JIFFY PER_NANOSECOND PER_MICROSECOND PER_MILLISECOND PER_SECOND PER_MINUTE PER_HOUR PER_DAY // Temperature CELSIUS KELVIN FAHRENHEIGHT Legal values are listed in the  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/controller-client/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/controller/client/helpers/MeasurementUnit.java MeasurementUnit enum. This enum is in the controller-client package, and is thus usable by java-based management clients. h2. Description of Parent/Child Relationships The address used to target an addressable portion of the model must be an ordered list of key value pairs. The effect of this requirement is the addressable portions of the model naturally form a tree structure, with parent nodes in the tree defining what the valid keys are and the children defining what the valid values are. The parent node also defines the cardinality of the relationship. The description of the parent node includes a children element that describes these relationships:      ....                .... description of the relationship with children of type "connector"                .... description of the relationship with children of type "virtual-host" The description of each relationship will include the following elements: * description -- String -- text description of the relationship * min-occurs -- int, either 0 or 1 -- Minimum number of children of this type that must exist in a valid model. If not present, the default value is 0. * max-occurs -- int -- Maximum number of children of this type that may exist in a valid model. If not present, the default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE, i.e. there is no limit. * allowed -- List of strings -- legal values for children names. If not present, there is no restriction on children names. * model-description -- either "undefined" or a complex structure -- This is the full description of the child resource (its text description, attributes, operations, children) as detailed above. This may also be "undefined", i.e. a null value, if the query that asked for the parent node's description did not include the "recursive" param set to true. Example with if the recursive flag was set to true:      "description" =&gt; "The connectors used to handle client connections",      "min-occurs" &gt; 1,           "description" =&gt; "Handles client connections",                ... details of children as documented above                .... details of operations as documented above                .... details of the children's children If the recursive flag was false:      "description" =&gt; "The connectors used to handle client connections",      "min-occurs" &gt; 1,      "model-description" =&gt; undefined h2. Applying Updates to Runtime Services An attribute or operation description may include a "restart-required" descriptor; this section is an explanation of the meaning of that descriptor. An operation that changes a management resource's persistent configuration usually can also also affect a runtime service associated with the resource. For example, there is a runtime service associated with any host.xml or standalone.xml &lt;interface&gt; element; other services in the runtime depend on that service to provide the InetAddress associated with the interface. In many cases, an update to a resource's persistent configuration can be immediately applied to the associated runtime service. The runtime service's state is updated to reflect the new value(s). However, in many cases the runtime service's state cannot be updated without restarting the service. Restarting a service can have broad effects. A restart of a service A will trigger a restart of other services B, C and D that depend A, triggering a restart of services that depend on B, C and D, etc. Those service restarts may very well disrupt handling of end-user requests. Because restarting a service can be disruptive to end-user request handling, the handlers for management operations will not restart any service without some form of explicit instruction from the end user indicating a service restart is desired. In a few cases, simply executing the operation is an indication the user wants services to restart (e.g. a /host=master/server-config=server-one:restart operation in a managed domain, or a /:reload operation on a standalone server.) For al other cases, if an operation (or attribute write) cannot be performed without restarting a service, the metadata describing the operation or attribute will include a "restart-required" descriptor whose value indicates what is necessary for the operation to affect the runtime: * no-services -- Applying the operation to the runtime does not require the restart of any services. This value is the default if the restart-required descriptor is not present. * all-services -- The operation can only immediately update the persistent configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will require a subsequent restart of all services in the affected VM. Executing the operation will put the server into a "reload-required" state. Until a restart of all services is performed the response to this operation and to any subsequent operation will include a response header "process-state" =&gt; "reload-required". For a standalone server, a restart of all services can be accomplished by executing the /:reload CLI command. For a server in a managed domain, restarting all services currently requires a full restart of the affected server VM (e.g. /host=master/server-config=server-one:restart). * jvm --The operation can only immediately update the persistent configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will require a full process restart (i.e. stop the JVM and launch a new JVM). Executing the operation will put the server into a "restart-required" state. Until a restart is performed the response to this operation and to any subsequent operation will include a response header "process-state" =&gt; "restart-required". For a standalone server, a full process restart requires first stopping the server via OS-level operations (Ctrl-C, kill) or via the /:shutdown CLI command, and then starting the server again from the command line. For a server in a managed domain, restarting a server requires executing the /host=&lt;host&gt;/server-config=&lt;server&gt;:restart operation. * resource-services -- The operation can only immediately update the persistent configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will require a subsequent restart of some services associated with the resource. If the operation includes the request header "allow-resource-service-restart" =&gt; true, the handler for the operation will go ahead and restart the runtime service. Otherwise executing the operation will put the server into a "reload-required" state. (See the discussion of "all-services" above for more on the "reload-required" state.) h2.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Detyped Description of the AS 7 Management Model</header>
    <body>h3. Deprecated, instead see https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Description+of+the+Management+Model for 7.1 or, for 7.2, https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Description+of+the+Management+Model. AS 7's management API will naturally include the ability for clients to query the management system to discover meta-information about the management model; i.e. what resources are available and what attributes and operations they expose. These details will be returned in a detyped form, either using the  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-dmr jboss-dmr library or JSON. (A JMX interface based on open mbeans will also be provided; most concepts in this article map naturally to JMX.) The purpose of this article is to describe the detyped representation of the API. Readers are encouraged to look at the example detyped descriptions of parts of the management API at the bottom before reading the details. Before getting into the details of the meta-information, first a couple quick examples on how to access it. h5. Reading Management Model Descriptions via the raw Management API The client must have maven artifact org.jboss.as:jboss-as-controller-client and its dependencies on the classpath. 1) Create a management client that can connect to your target process's native management socket (which can be an individual standalone mode server, or, in a domain mode environment, the Domain Controller or any Host Controller: The address and port are what is configured in the target process' &lt;management-apis&gt;&lt;native-api.../&gt; element. 2) Create an operation request object using the org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode class: See   https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16336 http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16336 for basic background on the format of an operation request. The key thing here is we are executing the "read-resource-description" operation. That operation can be targetted at any address in the management model; here we are targetting it at the resource for the web subsystem's http connector. The request includes two optional parameters: * recursive -- true means you want the description of child resources under this resource. Default is false * operations -- true means you want the description of operations exposed by the resource to be included. Default is false. 3) Execute the operation and manipulate the result: See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16354 http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16354 for general details on the structure of the "returnVal" ModelNode. h5.

Description of addressable portions of the management model All portions of the management model exposed by AS 7 are addressable via an ordered list of key/value pairs. For each addressable portion of the model, the following descriptive information will be available: * description -- String -- text description of this portion of the model * head-comment-allowed -- boolean -- indicates whether this portion of the model can store an XML comment that would be written in the persistent form of the model (e.g. domain.xml) before the start of the XML element that represents this portion of the model. This item is optional, and if not present defaults to true. +*(Note: storing XML comments in the in-memory model is not currently supported and likely will not be supported in AS 7.1. This description key is for future use.)*+ * tail-comment-allowed -- boolean -- similar to head-comment-allowed, but indicates whether a comment just before the close of the XML element is supported. A tail comment can only be supported if the element has child elements, in which case a comment can be inserted between the final child element and the element's closing tag. This item is optional, and if not present defaults to true. +*(Note: storing XML comments in the in-memory model is not currently supported and likely will not be supported in AS 7.1. This description key is for future use.)*+ * attributes -- Map of String (the attribute name) to complex structure -- the configuration attributes available in this portion of the model. See below for the representation of each attribute. * operations -- Map of String (the operation name) to complex structure -- the operations that can be targetted at this address. See below for the representation of each operation. * children -- Map of String (the type of child) to complex structure -- the relationship of this portion of the model to other addressable portions of the model. See below for the representation of each child relationship.      "description =&gt; "A managable resource",      "tail-comment-allowed" =&gt; false,                .... details of attribute foo                .... details of the start operation                .... details of the relationship with children of type "bar" h4. Description of an Attribute An attribute is a portion of the management model that is not directly addressable. Instead, it is conceptually a property of an addressable part of the model. For each attribute portion of the model, the following descriptive information will be available: * description -- String -- text description of the attribute * type -- org.jboss.dmr.ModelType -- the type of the attribute value. One of the enum values BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LIST, LONG, OBJECT, PROPERTY, STRING. Most of these are self-explanatory. An OBJECT will be represented in the detyped model as a map of string keys to values of some other legal type, conceptually similar to a javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData. A PROPERTY is a single key/value pair, where the key is a string, and the value is of some other legal type. * value-type -- ModelType or complex structure -- Only present if type is LIST or OBJECT. If type is LIST or all the values of the OBJECT type are of the same type, this will be one of the ModelType enums  BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT,  LONG, STRING. Otherwise, value-type will detail the structure of the attribute value, enumerating the value's fields and the type of their value. * required -- boolean -- true if the attribute will always exist in a representation of its portion of the model; false if it may not (implying a null value.) If not present, true is the default. * storage -- String -- Either "configuration" or "runtime". If "configuration" it means the attribute's value is stored as part of the persistent configuration (e.g. in domain.xml, host.xml or standalone.xml.) If "runtime" the attribute's value is not stored in the persistent configuration; the value only exists as long as the resource is running. * access-type -- String -- One of "read-only", "read-write" or "metric". Whether an attribute value can be written, or can only read. A "metric" is a read-only attribute whose value is not stored in the persistent configuration, and whose value may change due to activity on the server. If an attribute is "read-write", the resource will expose an operation named "write-attribute" whose "name" parameter will accept this attribute's name and whose "value" parameter will accept a valid value for this attribute. That operation will be the standard means of updating this attribute's value. * restart-required -- String -- One of "no-services", "all-services", "resource-services" or "jvm". Only relevant to attributes whose access-type is read-write. Indicates whether execution of a write-attribute operation whose name parameter specifies this attribute requires a restart of services (or an entire JVM) in order for the change to take effect in the runtime . See discussion of "Applying Updates to Runtime Services" below.  Default value is "no-services". * alternatives -- List of string -- Indicates an exclusive relationship between attributes. If this attribute is defined, the other attributes listed in this descriptor's value should be undefined (even if their required descriptor says true; i.e. the presence of this attribute satisfies the requirement.) Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most attributes. * requires -- List of string -- Indicates that if this attribute has a value (other than undefined), the other attributes listed in this descriptor's value must also have a value, even if their required descriptor says false. This would typically be used in conjunction with alternatives. For example, attributes "a" and "b" are required, but are alternatives to each other; "c" and "d" are optional. But "b" requires "c" and "d", so if "b" is used, "c" and "d" must also be defined. Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most attributes. * head-comment-allowed -- boolean -- indicates whether the model can store an XML comment that would be written in the persistent form of the model (e.g. domain.xml) before the start of the XML element that represents this attribute. This item is optional, and if not present defaults to *false*. (This is a different default from is used for an addressable portion of the model, since model attributes often map to XML attributes, which don't allow comments.) +*(Note: storing XML comments in the in-memory model is not currently supported and likely will not be supported in AS 7.1. This description key is for future use.)*+ * tail-comment-allowed -- boolean -- similar to head-comment-allowed, but indicates whether a comment just before the close of the XML element is supported. A tail comment can only be supported if the element has child elements, in which case a comment can be inserted between the final child element and the element's closing tag. This item is optional, and if not present defaults to *false*. (This is a different default from is used for an addressable portion of the model, since model attributes often map to XML attributes, which don't allow comments.) +*(Note: storing XML comments in the in-memory model is not currently supported and likely will not be supported in AS 7.1. This description key is for future use.)*+ * arbitrary key/value pairs that further describe the attribute value, e.g. "max" =&gt; 2. See "Arbitrary Descriptors" below.      "description" =&gt; "The foo",      "type" =&gt; INT,      "max" =&gt; 2      "description" =&gt; "The bar",      "type" =&gt; OBJECT,           "size" =&gt; INT,           "color" =&gt; STRING h3. Description of an Operation An addressable portion of the model may have operations associated with it. The description of an operation will include the following information: * operation-name -- String -- the name of the operation * description -- String -- text description of the operation * request-properties -- Map of String to complex structure -- description of the parameters of the operation. Keys are the names of the parameters, values are descriptions of the parameter value types. See below for details on the description of parameter value types. * reply-properties -- complex structure, or empty -- description of the return value of the operation, with an empty node meaning void. * restart-required -- String -- One of "no-services", "all-services", "resource-services" or "jvm". Indicates whether the operation makes a configuration change that requires a restart of services (or an entire JVM) in order for the change to take effect in the runtime. See discussion of "Applying Updates to Runtime Services" below.  Default value is "no-services". h4. Description of an Operation Parameter or Return Value * description -- String -- text description of the parameter or return value * type -- org.jboss.dmr.ModelType -- the type of the parameter or return value. One of the enum values BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LIST, LONG, OBJECT, PROPERTY, STRING. * value-type -- ModelType or complex structure -- Only present if type is LIST or OBJECT. If type is LIST or all the values of the OBJECT type are of the same type, this will be one of the ModelType enums  BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LIST, LONG, PROPERTY, STRING. Otherwise, value-type will detail the structure of the attribute value, enumerating the value's fields and the type of their value. * value-type -- ModelType or complex structure -- Only present if type is LIST or OBJECT. If type is LIST or all the values of the OBJECT type are of the same type, this will be one of the ModelType enums  BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT,  LONG, STRING. Otherwise, value-type will detail the structure of the attribute value, enumerating the value's fields and the type of their value. * required -- boolean -- Only relevant to parameters. true if the parameter must be present in the request object used to invoke the operation; false if it can omitted. If not present, true is the default. * nillable -- boolean -- true if null is a valid value.  If not present, false is the default. * restart-required -- String -- One of "no-services", "all-services", "resource-services" or "jvm". Only relevant to attributes whose access-type is read-write. Indicates whether execution of a write-attribute operation whose name parameter specifies this attribute requires a restart of services (or an entire JVM) in order for the change to take effect in the runtime . See discussion of "Applying Updates to Runtime Services" below.  Default value is "no-services". * alternatives -- List of string -- Indicates an exclusive relationship between parameters. If this attribute is defined, the other parameters listed in this descriptor's value should be undefined (even if their required descriptor says true; i.e. the presence of this parameter satisfies the requirement.) Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most parameters. * requires -- List of string -- Indicates that if this parameter has a value (other than undefined), the other parameters listed in this descriptor's value must also have a value, even if their required descriptor says false. This would typically be used in conjunction with alternatives. For example, parameters "a" and "b" are required, but are alternatives to each other; "c" and "d" are optional. But "b" requires "c" and "d", so if "b" is used, "c" and "d" must also be defined. Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most parameters. * arbitrary key/value pairs that further describe the attribute value, e.g. "max" =&gt;2. See "Arbitrary Descriptors" below.      "operation-name" =&gt; "incrementFoo",      "description" =&gt; "Increase the value of the 'foo' attribute by the given amount",                "type" =&gt; INT,                "description" =&gt; "The amount to increment",                "required" =&gt; true                "type" =&gt; INT,                "description" =&gt; "The new value",      "operation-name" =&gt; "start",      "description" =&gt; "Starts the thing", h2. Arbitrary Descriptors The description of an attribute, operation parameter or operation return value type can include arbitrary key/value pairs that provide extra information. Whether a particular key/value pair is present depends on the context, e.g. a pair with key "max" would probably only occur as part of the description of some numeric type. Following are standard keys and their expected value type. If descriptor authors want to add an arbitrary key/value pair to some descriptor and the semantic matches the meaning of one of the following items, the standard key/value type must be used. * min -- int -- the minimum value of some numeric type. The absence of this item implies there is no minimum value. * max -- int -- the maximum value of some numeric type. The absence of this item implies there is no maximum value. * min-length -- int -- the minimum length of some string, list or byte[] type. The absence of this item implies a minimum length of zero. * max-length -- int -- the maximum length of some string, list or byte[]. The absence of this item implies there is no maximum value. * nillable -- boolean -- whether null is a legal value. The absence of this item implies false; i.e. null is not a legal value. * allowed -- List -- a list of legal values. The type of the elements in the list should match the type of the attribute. * default -- the default value for the attribute if not present in the model * unit - The unit of the value - e.g. ns, ms, s, m, h, KB, MB, TB. See *Measurement Units* below. h4. Measurement Units Wherever possible, the description of an attribute, operation parameter or operation return value should include the unit arbitrary descriptor. Valid values for this descriptor are: // Simple Unit Types NONE PERCENTAGE // Absolute Sizes in Bytes (utilization) BYTES KILOBYTES MEGABYTES GIGABYTES TERABYTES PETABYTES // Absolute Sizes in Bits (throughput) BITS KILOBITS MEGABITS GIGABITS TERABITS PETABITS // Absolute Time - no display, only hints to the UI how to display EPOCH_MILLISECONDS EPOCH_SECONDS // Relative Time JIFFYS NANOSECONDS MICROSECONDS MILLISECONDS SECONDS MINUTES HOURS DAYS // Rate PER_JIFFY PER_NANOSECOND PER_MICROSECOND PER_MILLISECOND PER_SECOND PER_MINUTE PER_HOUR PER_DAY // Temperature CELSIUS KELVIN FAHRENHEIGHT Legal values are listed in the  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/controller-client/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/controller/client/helpers/MeasurementUnit.java MeasurementUnit enum. This enum is in the controller-client package, and is thus usable by java-based management clients. h2. Description of Parent/Child Relationships The address used to target an addressable portion of the model must be an ordered list of key value pairs. The effect of this requirement is the addressable portions of the model naturally form a tree structure, with parent nodes in the tree defining what the valid keys are and the children defining what the valid values are. The parent node also defines the cardinality of the relationship. The description of the parent node includes a children element that describes these relationships:      ....                .... description of the relationship with children of type "connector"                .... description of the relationship with children of type "virtual-host" The description of each relationship will include the following elements: * description -- String -- text description of the relationship * min-occurs -- int, either 0 or 1 -- Minimum number of children of this type that must exist in a valid model. If not present, the default value is 0. * max-occurs -- int -- Maximum number of children of this type that may exist in a valid model. If not present, the default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE, i.e. there is no limit. * allowed -- List of strings -- legal values for children names. If not present, there is no restriction on children names. * model-description -- either "undefined" or a complex structure -- This is the full description of the child resource (its text description, attributes, operations, children) as detailed above. This may also be "undefined", i.e. a null value, if the query that asked for the parent node's description did not include the "recursive" param set to true. Example with if the recursive flag was set to true:      "description" =&gt; "The connectors used to handle client connections",      "min-occurs" &gt; 1,           "description" =&gt; "Handles client connections",                ... details of children as documented above                .... details of operations as documented above                .... details of the children's children If the recursive flag was false:      "description" =&gt; "The connectors used to handle client connections",      "min-occurs" &gt; 1,      "model-description" =&gt; undefined h2. Applying Updates to Runtime Services An attribute or operation description may include a "restart-required" descriptor; this section is an explanation of the meaning of that descriptor. An operation that changes a management resource's persistent configuration usually can also also affect a runtime service associated with the resource. For example, there is a runtime service associated with any host.xml or standalone.xml &lt;interface&gt; element; other services in the runtime depend on that service to provide the InetAddress associated with the interface. In many cases, an update to a resource's persistent configuration can be immediately applied to the associated runtime service. The runtime service's state is updated to reflect the new value(s). However, in many cases the runtime service's state cannot be updated without restarting the service. Restarting a service can have broad effects. A restart of a service A will trigger a restart of other services B, C and D that depend A, triggering a restart of services that depend on B, C and D, etc. Those service restarts may very well disrupt handling of end-user requests. Because restarting a service can be disruptive to end-user request handling, the handlers for management operations will not restart any service without some form of explicit instruction from the end user indicating a service restart is desired. In a few cases, simply executing the operation is an indication the user wants services to restart (e.g. a /host=master/server-config=server-one:restart operation in a managed domain, or a /:reload operation on a standalone server.) For al other cases, if an operation (or attribute write) cannot be performed without restarting a service, the metadata describing the operation or attribute will include a "restart-required" descriptor whose value indicates what is necessary for the operation to affect the runtime: * no-services -- Applying the operation to the runtime does not require the restart of any services. This value is the default if the restart-required descriptor is not present. * all-services -- The operation can only immediately update the persistent configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will require a subsequent restart of all services in the affected VM. Executing the operation will put the server into a "reload-required" state. Until a restart of all services is performed the response to this operation and to any subsequent operation will include a response header "process-state" =&gt; "reload-required". For a standalone server, a restart of all services can be accomplished by executing the /:reload CLI command. For a server in a managed domain, restarting all services currently requires a full restart of the affected server VM (e.g. /host=master/server-config=server-one:restart). * jvm --The operation can only immediately update the persistent configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will require a full process restart (i.e. stop the JVM and launch a new JVM). Executing the operation will put the server into a "restart-required" state. Until a restart is performed the response to this operation and to any subsequent operation will include a response header "process-state" =&gt; "restart-required". For a standalone server, a full process restart requires first stopping the server via OS-level operations (Ctrl-C, kill) or via the /:shutdown CLI command, and then starting the server again from the command line. For a server in a managed domain, restarting a server requires executing the /host=&lt;host&gt;/server-config=&lt;server&gt;:restart operation. * resource-services -- The operation can only immediately update the persistent configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will require a subsequent restart of some services associated with the resource. If the operation includes the request header "allow-resource-service-restart" =&gt; true, the handler for the operation will go ahead and restart the runtime service. Otherwise executing the operation will put the server into a "reload-required" state. (See the discussion of "all-services" above for more on the "reload-required" state.) h2.

    <body>Hello All, I am trying to migrate an ejb 1.1 app from weblogic to ejb 3.1 JBoss 7.1, and I am currently trying to find the equivalant of the getHandle() call for EJB3 spec. In the 1.1 app the handle is serialized to file, in the event that the client lost their connection to the server, the handle is deserialized and used to connect to the same session bean which will be in the same state it was last left at instead of starting from scratch. The getHandle() is not available in the EJB3 spec, is there another equivalant of this? I have tried serializing the remote proxy, but it didn't help. Is there a work around for this issue. ta.</body>

    <body>Hi bruce, I'd suppose it is cause by Editor. What Editor dou you use? Check what encoding you set for this file. Better: attach the file (remove sensitive info first). By the way: JBoss vault is *not safe*. It only gives you false feeling of safety. You *disclose the password* to access the vault via KEYSTORE_PASSWORD. Everyone can easily decrypt all the passwords you have encrypted. Be aware that you don't get more safety with JBoss vault. Regards, mentallurg</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Two-phase commit	using an XA-datasource</header>
    <body>Howdy! I'd like to ask a question about using an xa-datasource defined within my AS7 instance. *What I did:* I defined two different xa-datasources pointing to two databases *What I need:* I need to implement a two phase commit using those two xa-datasources mentioned above. Is there any Java sample/example how to use the JBoss transactional mechanism to do what I need? As I understood, I can (I have to) use an ordinary DataSource instead of XADataSource in my code, right? How does it work? What is the right way to do following: 1. Create two connections to 2 different DBs (using xa-datasources defined within my AS7) 2. Do some operations over both of them 3. Do a final commit (or rollback if any error) Last question - what's the role of the JBoss's TransactionManager? How does it work? Is it hidden for the developers or do we need to instantiate it explicitly? Since I didn't found any sufficient answer I appreciate any explanation and help! Thanks a lot, Bobo</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Two-phase commit using an XA-datasource</header>
    <body>The AS7 quickstarts ( https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-quickstart https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-quickstart) have some transactions examples including how to update two datasources within a single transaction (look for CMT, BMT, jts and the crash-rec examples). It is possible to enlist a single non-XA aware datasource (search for LRCO for details) but we don't support it since it is not a recommended configuration. The transaction manager is initialised by the AS so you don't create it yourself. Normally you would use the EJB mechanisms for controlling transactions - the quickstarts cover both bean managed and container managed transactions. If you really want to get hold of the transaction manager you can look it up via JNDI (but the name is not standardised by the specifications, I believe AS7 uses java:jboss/TransactionManager).</body>

    <body>It indeed isn't standardized. I've created a spec issue some time ago to standardize this. If you, or anyone else thinks this is important too, please vote for it at:  http://java.net/jira/browse/JAVAEE_SPEC-8 http://java.net/jira/browse/JAVAEE_SPEC-8 The issue with those names being not standardized is not even so much that they differ between application servers of different vendors, but that they differ between versions of the same AS (e.g. JBoss AS 6 vs JBoss AS 7).</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [IronJacamar Development] - possible bad side effects from change to AbstractConnectionManager</header>
    <body>After migrating from jboss4 to jboss7 (currently jboss-as-7.1.1Final), we started seeing the error 'Unable to get managed connection' during certain high load periods using the same size pool that we were using in jboss4.  I put more details in this discussion:  https://community.jboss.org/thread/214179 https://community.jboss.org/thread/214179 It seemed that there should still have been available connections while we got this error because MySQL showed the connections as sleeping.  I was looking at the code where the error is being thrown org.jboss.jca.core.connectionmanager.AbstractConnectionManager (ironjacamar-core-impl-1.0.9.Final.jar) at line 329.   I added one call that seems to help a little with our application, but I'm unsure if the benefits outweigh any negative side effects. After line 333, failure = e; I added a pool flush.  Here is the diff: 334a335,336 The flush seems to release the connection that wasn't sleeping so it can be used again. Is there a better way to accomplish this?</body>

Then look into the &lt;validation&gt; element and provide the plugins needed (MySQL), and do &lt;flush-strategy&gt;IdleConnections&lt;/flush-strategy&gt; If you still have errors after that I would need to see TRACE log from org.jboss.jca and your full configuration.</body>

    <body>I am going to test with 1.0.13.Final, 1.1.0.Beta3, and then if those don't work, I can try the head version (is there a repository with nightly builds or should I just build it myself).  My question is which version of jboss are those built against.  When I used 1.0.13.Final, I am getting this error: Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.jboss.jca.common.api.metadata.ds.DataSource$Tag from [Module "org.jboss.as.connector:main" from local module loader @538d7ace (roots: /usr/java/jboss/modules)] so I will update the org.jboss.as.connector module, but I want to make sure I am using the correct version. Thanks for your help.  I really appreciate it.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Layered Distributions and Module Path Organization</header>
    <body>h1. Fundamental Concepts h2. Distribution A coherent set of software produced by a "project" or a "product". JBoss AS 7 is a project. JBoss EAP is such a product. Both play similar technical roles in the JBoss ecosystem, but there are significant differences in how the two are made available to end users. This article uses "distribution" as a replacement for constantly saying "project/product" everywhere. It's not a great term; if someone has a better one, please suggest it. h2. Distribution Base The "distribution base" is the core set of modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that is common to all layered distributions. It may itself be usable standalone project or product. Currently the JBoss AS 7 project and the JBoss EAP product are the distribution bases relevant to this discussion. In the future a more limited subset of functionality may become the distribution base, with the full set of functionality currently provided in community AS and EAP coming as layered distributions or add-ons. h2. Layered Distribution A distribution that builds on top of the distribution base, potentially superceding some of the distribution base's functionality. A layered distribution is allowed to supercede any aspect of the distribution base's functionality. The less the layered distribution does this, the easier it will be for the layered distribution to manage things like patching, but, if necessary, a layered distribution can supercede anything in the distribution base. +TODO can a layered distribution build on top of another layered distribution?+ h2. Identity An identity is a named set of distribution base + layered distribution(s) that is certified as a valid combination. The distribution base by itself may or may not be a valid identity. Currently it is; in the future it may not be. h3. Patching and Identities Patches are applicable to an identity. A given patch can apply to more than one identity, if there are no conflicts between the identities in terms of how they use the items modified by a patch. The metadata associated with a patch will indicate the identities to which it is applicable. For modules and bundles within a patch, the patch metadata will provide the name of the provider of the module or bundle -- that is, either the distribution base or the name of a layered distribution that is part of the identity. Once the patch is applied, that association is retained. Miscellaneous files within a patch are not associated with the distribution base or any particular layered distribution once they are installed. Each identity produces a patch stream. Because a given patch can apply to more than one identity, the same patch can appear in multiple patch streams. A patch for a given identity may incorporate as a separately identifiable component a patch produced by another identity or the distribution base. For example, let's an identity named A consists of the distribution base and a layered distribution named A. Version 1.0 of identity A is based on version 2.0 of the distribution base and version 1.0 of layered distribution A. The distribution base produces a patch that will move it to version 2.1. The producers of the A identity could then produce a patch that will result in version 1.1 of identity A. This would include an upgrade of layered distribution A to its version 1.1, as well as the a separate component that provides the distribution base upgrade to its 2.1. There are two main benefits of this sharing approach: * The modules and bundles provided by the distribution base upgrade are associated with the original 2.1 patch provided by the distribution base, not just with the enclosing patch provided by A. This will make possible the sharing of modules/bundles provided by patches across installations. * Incorporating one patch within another as a simple discrete unit helps avoid errors during patch production. h2. Installation An installation is a single filesystem location containing the distribution base plus zero or more layered distributions. It includes the bin/ dir from which processes are launched. The root of the installation is the path indicated by the $JBOSS_HOME environment variable referred to in the scripts and indicated by the jboss.home.dir system property used in the java code. h3. Installation Identity Each installation has a single identity. Because an installation only has a single identity, there is no confusion as to which layered distribution "owns" a particular filesystem location in that installation. +TODO further spell out the importance of single identity.+ h3. Sharing Files Across Installations+ + Modules and bundles are potentially sharable across installations. Making it easy for users to do this should be a key goal. Miscellaneous files are not sharable across installations. (An end user could potentially share them using symlinks, but doing so is not a supported feature nor is it a recommended practice.) Patches are not sharable across installations. The +modules and bundles that the patch provides+ are potentially sharable, but the miscellaneous files provided by a patch are not sharable. The patching history metadata that the patching tool records in the installation is also not sharable -- the metadata is associated with the given installation. However, making it easy to share the the modules and bundles provide by a patch across installations should be a key goal. h2. Add-On Distribution An add-on distribution is a set of software that extends the capabilities of a given "identity". An add-on can only extend capabilities. It is not allowed to supercede capabilities of the identity it extends. For modules and OSGi bundles, the module and bundle loading logic provided by the distribution base will enforce this behavior. For miscellaneous files, it is up to the people providing an add-on to ensure that the add-on does not overwrite any file provided by the distribution base, any layered distribution associated with the identity or any other add-ons associated with the identity. Conversely, once the providers of an identity have accepted an add-on into their ecosystem, it is their responsibility to ensure that they do not add any files to their distributions that will conflict with files already provided by the add-on. In practice, the most likely sources of conflict will be the xml files in the configuration directories and the .conf files in the bin directory. Conflicts over xml files are solvable by having add-on providers ship their own xml file variants rather than attempting to modify the standard ones that ship with the identity. A given add-on is allowed to extend the capabilities of more than one identity. An add-on may require the presence of other add-ons. h3. Patching and Add-ons Add-on distributions produce their own patch stream. The patches produced by an add-on indicate the versions of the identity that must be present for the patch to apply. More than one identity can be listed, since add-ons may be applicable to multiple identities. The patches produced by an add-on also indicate the existing version of the add-on that must be present, as well as the version of any other required add-ons. Add-ons cannot use patches in their own stream to fix problems in the identity on which they depend. Add-ons depend on the patch stream provided by their dependent identity to provide such fixes. Modules and bundles provided by an add-on or its patches will have lower precedence in the module loading order than those that come from the distribution base or layered distributions, so any fix to such a module/bundle provided by an add-on patch will have no effect. h1. Installers +TODO discussion of RPM+ h2. Distribution Base Installers The distribution base can be installed via a simple unzip. If the distribution base is itself an identity, see also "Identity Installers" h2. Identity Installers An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that contains any depended upon identity or the installation base of a zip that only includes * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an identity is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is irrevocably changed.+* When an identity is installed it has the right to modify any miscellaneous files in the installation filesystem, so once an identity is installed, the identity of the installation is changed. In many (hopefully nearly all) cases it may be possible for a user to remove files added by an identity install and get the installation back to its previous identity, but doing this is not a supported feature of the software and is not a recommended practice. *+However, once support for installing patches via the patching tool is available, reverting an identity installation will be possible.+* The patching tool maintains backup copies of any miscellaneous files modified by a patch, making it possible to restore those files. h2. Add-on Installer An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that contains any depended upon identity or the installation base of a zip that only includes * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an add-on is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is not changed, and it must be possible to reverse the installation.+* An add-on is merely additive, so removing it is a matter of deleting what was added. This could be done via a script provided by the add-on, via an installer program, or manually by a user following a set of instructions. h1. Establishing Identity It +must+ be possible for external tools to determine the identity of a given installation without requiring the software based on that installation to be running. It's also necessary for the software based on an installation to determine its own identity. This will be done via the bin/product.conf file located in the distribution. This file will include: * The name of the identity * The name of any layered distributions used by the identity, in order of the precedence to be used when loading their modules. If no bin/product.conf file exists, the installation is assumed to be the community version of the distribution base. If no layered distributions are named in the file, only the base and any add-ons will be used. h1. Module Path Organization JBoss AS currently loads modules based on a "module path" which is a list of filesystem locations which JBoss Modules searches for modules. In our standard launch scripts, users are able to manipulate this module path by setting the $JBOSS_MODULEPATH environment variable. If not set, $JBOSS_MODULEPATH is set to $JBOSS_HOME/modules. This mechanism creates a single default location under which modules can be located. This is problematic when layered distributions and add-ons wish to install their own modules, since there are no clear rules as to how those modules should be installed or how they relate to one another. h3. Goals * To make it easy for other layered distributions or add-ons to add their modules to the set of available modules or remove their modules from the set of available modules, without fear of physically overwriting modules provided with the distribution base or by other layered distributions. * To make it easy for distributions that add modules to declare that a set of modules is sharable (as defined below) with the modules provided by any other Red Hat product that runs on the major version of the core AS (including the modules provided by the core AS) * To establish clear rules for how distributions that add modules that must take precedence over sharable modules with the same name and slot provided by other distributions should:* locate those modules * indicate at launch time to the modular classloading system which set of distribution specific non-sharable modules should be used * To make it easy for end users to alter the module path for their own purposes by setting $JBOSS_MODULEPATH without needing to concern themselves with details of how the modules provided by the distribtuion base, layered distributions, or add-ons relate to one another. Reserve the use of $JBOSS_MODULEPATH and the value of the -mp command line argument passed to jboss-modules for end use uses. h3. Sharability Rules All modules provided as part of the distribution base are shareable. When the distribution base includes a module it accepts the following: * The version of the module it provides will take precedence over the +shareable+ version provided by any layered distribution or any module provide by an add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any layered distribution or add-on based that version of the distribution base. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the distribution base cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another layered distribution or add-on, even if the distribution base itself no longer needs that module. A layered distribution can provide both shareable and non-shareable modules. If a layered distribution declares that a given module is "shareable", it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the layered distribution is associated: * The distribution base may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the sharable module provided by the layered distribution. * Another layered distribution or add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * Another layered distribution or add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other layered distribution or add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any layered distribution or add-on based on the same major version of the identity. * The distribution base cannot depend upon a sharable module provided by a layered distribution. * An add-on associated with an identity can depend upon shareable modules provided by any layered distribution associated with the identity. Further, other layered distributions within the same identity can also can depend up a shareable module provided by the layered distribution. As a result, if a layered distribution provides shareable shareable modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons or layered distribution. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the layered distribution cannot remove a shareable module that is depended upon by an add-on or another layered-distribution, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module. All modules provided as part of an add-on are "shareable". When an add-on includes a module, it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the add-on is associated: * The distribution base or a layered distribution may ship a non-sharable module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the sharable module provided by the add-on. * A layered distribution or another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * A layered distribution or add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other layered distribution or add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any layered distribution or add-on based on the same major version of the identity. * The distribution base or a layered distribution cannot depend upon a sharable module provided by an add-on. * As a consequence of the previous point, an add-on can remove a sharable module in a patch, without fear of breaking a core identity. * An add-on can depend up a shareable module provided by another add-on upon which it depends, but only with the express consent of that add-on. Such dependencies are strongly discouraged. * If an add-on allows another add-on to depend upon its shareable modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons based that version of the add-on. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the add-on cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another add-on, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module.+ + * Testing procedures must be created to ensure that any patches produced by the depended-upon add-on do not break the dependent add-on. h4. Requirement for Standardized Module Loading JBoss Modules can support other mechanisms for finding module content and loading it besides the filesystem-based module path mechanism. Theoretically a custom boot module loader implementation could be specified at process launch, with that module loader using some other means for locating module content. This article proposes that this capability be declared as unsupported for JBoss AS and products based upon it. Rather, the AS will have a specified boot module loader implementation. Users of the AS community project are free to use a non-standard boot module loader implementation, but if they do so and certain features provided by the AS don't work, that is their problem.</body>

This could be done via a script provided by the add-on, via an installer program, or manually by a user following a set of instructions. h1. Establishing Identity It +must+ be possible for external tools to determine the identity of a given installation without requiring the software based on that installation to be running. It's also necessary for the software based on an installation to determine its own identity. This will be done via the bin/product.conf file located in the distribution. This file will include: * The name of the identity * The name of any layered distributions used by the identity, in order of the precedence to be used when loading their modules. If no bin/product.conf file exists, the installation is assumed to be the community version of the distribution base. If no layered distributions are named in the file, only the base and any add-ons will be used. h1. Module Loading JBoss AS currently loads modules based on a "module path" which is a list of filesystem locations which JBoss Modules searches for modules. In our standard launch scripts, users are able to manipulate this module path by setting the $JBOSS_MODULEPATH environment variable. If not set, $JBOSS_MODULEPATH is set to $JBOSS_HOME/modules. This mechanism creates a single default location under which modules can be located. This is problematic when layered distributions and add-ons wish to install their own modules, since there are no clear rules as to how those modules should be installed or how they relate to one another. h2. Goals * To make it easy for other layered distributions or add-ons to add their modules to the set of available modules or remove their modules from the set of available modules, without fear of physically overwriting modules provided with the distribution base or by other layered distributions. * To make it easy for distributions that add modules to declare that a set of modules is sharable (as defined below) with the modules provided by any distribution associated with a given identity (including the modules provided by the distribution base) * To establish clear rules for how distributions that add modules that must take precedence over sharable modules with the same name and slot provided by other distributions should:* locate those modules * indicate at launch time to the modular classloading system which set of distribution specific non-sharable modules should be used * To make it easy for end users to alter the module path for their own purposes by setting $JBOSS_MODULEPATH without needing to concern themselves with details of how the modules provided by the distribtuion base, layered distributions, or add-ons relate to one another. Reserve the use of $JBOSS_MODULEPATH and the value of the -mp command line argument passed to jboss-modules for end use uses. h2. Sharability Rules All modules provided as part of the distribution base are shareable. When the distribution base includes a module it accepts the following: * The version of the module it provides will take precedence over the +shareable+ version provided by any layered distribution or any module provide by an add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any layered distribution or add-on based that version of the distribution base. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the distribution base cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another layered distribution or add-on, even if the distribution base itself no longer needs that module. A layered distribution can provide both shareable and non-shareable modules. If a layered distribution declares that a given module is "shareable", it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the layered distribution is associated: * The distribution base may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the sharable module provided by the layered distribution. * Another layered distribution or add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * Another layered distribution or add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other layered distribution or add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any layered distribution or add-on based on the same major version of the identity. * The distribution base cannot depend upon a sharable module provided by a layered distribution. * An add-on associated with an identity can depend upon shareable modules provided by any layered distribution associated with the identity. Further, other layered distributions within the same identity can also can depend up a shareable module provided by the layered distribution. As a result, if a layered distribution provides shareable shareable modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons or layered distribution. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the layered distribution cannot remove a shareable module that is depended upon by an add-on or another layered-distribution, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module. If a layered distribution declares that a given module is non-shareable, it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the layered distribution is associated: * The version of the module it provides will take precedence over:* The module provided by the distribution base. * The module provided by any other layered distribution that this layered distribution depends upon. * The shareable version of any add-on or layered distribution. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any add-on or other depended-upon layered distribution associated with the identity. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the layered distribution cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the layered distribution itself no longer needs that module. * The layered distribution may allow add-ons or other layered distributions to depend upon it. If it does so, +with respect to those other layered distributions or add-ons, even non-shareable modules are treated as shareable, and the rules give above for layered distribution shareable modules apply+. The only exception is if the distribution base ships a module with the same name and slot, the distribution base version does not take precedence. All modules provided as part of an add-on are "shareable". When an add-on includes a module, it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the add-on is associated: * The distribution base or a layered distribution may ship a non-sharable module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the sharable module provided by the add-on. * A layered distribution or another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * A layered distribution or add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other layered distribution or add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any layered distribution or add-on based on the same major version of the identity. * The distribution base or a layered distribution cannot depend upon a sharable module provided by an add-on. * As a consequence of the previous point, an add-on can remove a sharable module in a patch, without fear of breaking a core identity. * An add-on can depend up a shareable module provided by another add-on upon which it depends, but only with the express consent of that add-on. Such dependencies are strongly discouraged. * If an add-on allows another add-on to depend upon its shareable modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons based that version of the add-on. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the add-on cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another add-on, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module.+ + * Testing procedures must be created to ensure that any patches produced by the depended-upon add-on do not break the dependent add-on. h2. Module Organization on the Filesystem This section will describe how the above points are reflected in the actual organization of modules on the filesystem. h4. Requirement for Standardized Module Loading JBoss Modules can support other mechanisms for finding module content and loading it besides the filesystem-based module path mechanism. Theoretically a custom boot module loader implementation could be specified at process launch, with that module loader using some other means for locating module content. This article proposes that this capability be declared as unsupported for JBoss AS and products based upon it. Rather, the AS will have a specified boot module loader implementation. Users of the AS community project are free to use a non-standard boot module loader implementation, but if they do so and certain features provided by the AS don't work, that is their problem. h3. Filesystem Layout Modules would be organized on the filesystem as follows: modules + internal ++ add-ons +++ abc +++ def ++ layers +++ base +++ vuw +++ xyz The internal level exists to separate modules associated with the distribution base, layered distribution or add-ons from those the end user may store in the modules directory. +TODO Some better name for internal would be nice.+ h3. Translation of Filesystem Layout into Module Loading Precedence For any location provided by the user via the -mp switch, the module loader will look for the internal structure. If it is found in more than one location, an exception will be thrown. The module loader will understand the structure above and will apply module loading precedence rules as follows. Assume the above structure exists under $JBOSS_HOME and that the user sets $JBOSS_MODULEPATH as follows JBOSS_MODULESPATH=/user/me/my-modules;$JBOSS_HOME/modules In addition, the bin/product.conf file declares that the identity of the install is xyz, the xyz layered distribution should be loaded and the xyz layered distribution depends on the vuw layered distribution. Assume also that patches named base-1, abc-1, def-1, vuw-1, xyz-1 and xyz-2 have been applied. The module loader would look for modules on the filesystem in following locations, starting with first and terminating as soon as the module is found: /user/me/my-modules /modules (in case the user placed modules directly in under this directory) /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-1 /modules/layers/xyz /modules/layers/vuw/patches/vuw-1 /modules/layers/vuw /modules/layers/base/patches/base-1 /modules/layers/base /modules/add-ons/abc/patches/abc-1 /modules/add-ons/abc /modules/add-ons/def/patches/def-1 /modules/add-ons/def The precedence order between /modules/add-ons/abc and /modules/add-ons/def is arbitrary. An add-on should never assume its modules will take precedence over those of any other add-on's modules. The fact that the various patches locations are included in the path is entirely due to +metadata+ that the patching tool will store in the $JBOSS_HOME/patches directory. The mere presence of a directory like /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 is insufficient to trigger inclusion of that directory in the module search path. However, when the patching tool installs the patch, the actual location of the +module contents+ will be in /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 -- only patching related metadata will be stored in $JBOSS_HOME/patches. This behavior is important for allowing sharing of modules across installations. h2. Sharing Modules Across Installations The above behavior makes it relatively straightforward for a user to share modules across installations. For example, the user could set up a shared module repo in /user/me with the following structure jboss-module-repo + add-ons ++ abc ++ def + layers ++ base ++ vuw ++ xyz The $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal location in each installation on the filesystem could then be replaced with a symlink to /user/me/jboss-module-repo. The downside to this very simple sharing is the abc and def add-ons will be visible and used by all installations, whether or not they are relevant to the installation's identity. A solution to this problem would be to do more symlinks: $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/layers -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/layers $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/add-ons/abc -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/abc $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/add-ons/def -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/def As an improvement at some point we could define some sort of file format (say xml) and allow a file with that format to be placed in $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal in lieu of the subdirectories. The file would include all of the mapping information for the external repo. The patching tool or any programmatic installers would know how to read and update that file. The file would only include information for the add-ons relevant to the installation. h3. Implications for the Patching Tool The possibility of module sharing doesn't remove the requirement to apply a patch to each installation on a given filesystem. Applying the patch to each installation is required in order to: *  update any miscellaneous files * record the patching metadata for the particular installation * allow the patching tool to understand what combinations of layered distributions and add-ons are relevant to the given installation However, the patching tool should recognize the possibility of this kind of module sharing. When it applies a patch it should recognize that the modules may already exist on the filesystem and should not apply them again if not necessary. It should however record some information in, e.g. /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 indicating that the installation being patched is using that set of patch modules. This information will prevent deletion of patch modules used by multiple installations if one of the installations uses the patching feature's cleanup functions. h1. OSGi Bundle Loading This needs discussion, but the basic concept is the precedence rules for OSGi bundle loading would following the same rules as for module loading.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Layered Distributions and Module Path Organization</header>
    <body>h1. +*This is an article outlining some thoughts by the author*+ +(Brian Stansberry)++*. It is not an official design of the JBoss AS 7 project.*+ h1. Overview This document describes notions for how different software distributions based on the JBoss AS 7 project can integrate with the base AS and with each other in a controlled manner. +* *+ h1. Fundamental Concepts h2. Distribution A coherent set of software produced by a "project" or a "product". JBoss AS 7 is a project. JBoss EAP is such a product. Both play similar technical roles in the JBoss ecosystem, but there are significant differences in how the two are made available to end users. This article uses "distribution" as a replacement for constantly saying "project/product" everywhere. It's not a great term; if someone has a better one, please suggest it. h2. Distribution Base The "distribution base" is the core set of modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that is common to all layered distributions. It may itself be usable standalone project or product. Currently the JBoss AS 7 project and the JBoss EAP product are the distribution bases relevant to this discussion. In the future a more limited subset of functionality may become the distribution base, with the full set of functionality currently provided in community AS and EAP coming as layered distributions or add-ons. h2. Layered Distribution A distribution that builds on top of the distribution base, potentially superceding some of the distribution base's functionality. A layered distribution is allowed to supercede any aspect of the distribution base's functionality. The less the layered distribution does this, the easier it will be for the layered distribution to manage things like patching, but, if necessary, a layered distribution can supercede anything in the distribution base. A layered distribution build on top of another layered distribution, provided it has worked out the necessary procedures to ensure compatibility. h2. Identity An identity is a named set of distribution base + layered distribution(s) that is certified as a valid combination. The distribution base by itself may or may not be a valid identity. Currently it is; in the future it may not be. A given layered distribution may be associated with more than one identity. h3. Patching and Identities Patches are applicable to an identity. A given patch can apply to more than one identity, if there are no conflicts between the identities in terms of how they use the items modified by a patch. The metadata associated with a patch will indicate the identities to which it is applicable. For modules and bundles within a patch, the patch metadata will provide the name of the provider of the module or bundle -- that is, either the distribution base or the name of a layered distribution that is part of the identity. Once the patch is applied, that association is retained. Miscellaneous files within a patch are not associated with the distribution base or any particular layered distribution once they are installed. Each identity produces a patch stream. Because a given patch can apply to more than one identity, the same patch can appear in multiple patch streams. A patch for a given identity may incorporate as a separately identifiable component a patch produced by another identity or the distribution base. For example, let's an identity named A consists of the distribution base and a layered distribution named A. Version 1.0 of identity A is based on version 2.0 of the distribution base and version 1.0 of layered distribution A. The distribution base produces a patch that will move it to version 2.1. The producers of the A identity could then produce a patch that will result in version 1.1 of identity A. This would include an upgrade of layered distribution A to its version 1.1, as well as the a separate component that provides the distribution base upgrade to its 2.1. There are two main benefits of this sharing approach: * The modules and bundles provided by the distribution base upgrade are associated with the original 2.1 patch provided by the distribution base, not just with the enclosing patch provided by A. This will make possible the sharing of modules/bundles provided by patches across installations. * Incorporating one patch within another as a simple discrete unit helps avoid errors during patch production. h2. Installation An installation is a single filesystem location containing the distribution base plus zero or more layered distributions. It includes the bin/ dir from which processes are launched. The root of the installation is the path indicated by the $JBOSS_HOME environment variable referred to in the scripts and indicated by the jboss.home.dir system property used in the java code. h3. Installation Identity Each installation has a single identity. Because an installation only has a single identity, there is no confusion as to which layered distribution "owns" a particular filesystem location in that installation. Further, because the identity of an installation can be easily determined (see "Establishing Identity" below), external tools can quickly understand the functionality provided by a given installation, even if no process is currently running from the installation. +TODO further spell out the importance of single identity.+ h3. Sharing Files Across Installations+ + Modules and bundles are potentially sharable across installations. Making it easy for users to do this should be a key goal. Miscellaneous files are not sharable across installations. (An end user could potentially share them using symlinks, but doing so is not a supported feature nor is it a recommended practice.) Patches are not sharable across installations. The +modules and bundles that the patch provides+ are potentially sharable, but the miscellaneous files provided by a patch are not sharable. The patching history metadata that the patching tool records in the installation is also not sharable -- the metadata is associated with the given installation. However, making it easy to share the the modules and bundles provide by a patch across installations should be a key goal. h2. Add-On Distribution An add-on distribution is a set of software that extends the capabilities of a given "identity". An add-on can only extend capabilities. It is not allowed to supercede capabilities of the identity it extends. For modules and OSGi bundles, the module and bundle loading logic provided by the distribution base will enforce this behavior. For miscellaneous files, it is up to the people providing an add-on to ensure that the add-on does not overwrite any file provided by the distribution base, any layered distribution associated with the identity or any other add-ons associated with the identity. Conversely, once the providers of an identity have accepted an add-on into their ecosystem, it is their responsibility to ensure that they do not add any files to their distributions that will conflict with files already provided by the add-on. In practice, the most likely sources of conflict will be the xml files in the configuration directories and the .conf files in the bin directory. Conflicts over xml files are solvable by having add-on providers ship their own xml file variants rather than attempting to modify the standard ones that ship with the identity. A given add-on is allowed to extend the capabilities of more than one identity. An add-on may require the presence of other add-ons. h3. Patching and Add-ons Add-on distributions produce their own patch stream. The patches produced by an add-on indicate the versions of the identity that must be present for the patch to apply. More than one identity can be listed, since add-ons may be applicable to multiple identities. The patches produced by an add-on also indicate the existing version of the add-on that must be present, as well as the version of any other required add-ons. Add-ons cannot use patches in their own stream to fix problems in the identity on which they depend. Add-ons depend on the patch stream provided by their dependent identity to provide such fixes. Modules and bundles provided by an add-on or its patches will have lower precedence in the module loading order than those that come from the distribution base or layered distributions, so any fix to such a module/bundle provided by an add-on patch will have no effect. h1. Installers +TODO discussion of RPM+ h2. Distribution Base Installers The distribution base can be installed via a simple unzip. If the distribution base is itself an identity, see also "Identity Installers" h2. Identity Installers An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that already contains a depended upon identity or the installation base of a zip that only includes the layered distribution(s) to be added. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an identity is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is irrevocably changed.+* When an identity is installed it has the right to modify any miscellaneous files in the installation filesystem, so once an identity is installed, the identity of the installation is changed. In many (hopefully nearly all) cases it may be possible for a user to remove files added by an identity install and get the installation back to its previous identity, but doing this is not a supported feature of the software and is not a recommended practice. *+However, once support for installing patches via the patching tool is available, reverting an identity installation will be possible.+* The patching tool maintains backup copies of any miscellaneous files modified by a patch, making it possible to restore those files. h2. Add-on Installer An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions along with the add-on itself. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that contains any depended upon identity of a zip that only includes the add-on. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an add-on is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is not changed, and it must be possible to reverse the installation.+* An add-on is merely additive, so removing it is a matter of deleting what was added. This could be done via a script provided by the add-on, via an installer program, or manually by a user following a set of instructions. h1. Establishing Identity It +must+ be possible for external tools to determine the identity of a given installation without requiring the software based on that installation to be running. It's also necessary for the software based on an installation to determine its own identity. This will be done via the bin/product.conf file located in the distribution. This file will include: * The name of the identity * The name of any layered distributions used by the identity, in order of the precedence to be used when loading their modules. If no bin/product.conf file exists, the installation is assumed to be the community version of the distribution base. If no layered distributions are named in the file, only the base and any add-ons will be used. h1. Module Loading JBoss AS currently loads modules based on a "module path" which is a list of filesystem locations which JBoss Modules searches for modules. In our standard launch scripts, users are able to manipulate this module path by setting the $JBOSS_MODULEPATH environment variable. If not set, $JBOSS_MODULEPATH is set to $JBOSS_HOME/modules. This mechanism creates a single default location under which modules can be located. This is problematic when layered distributions and add-ons wish to install their own modules, since there are no clear rules as to how those modules should be installed or how they relate to one another. h2. Goals * To make it easy for other layered distributions or add-ons to add their modules to the set of available modules or remove their modules from the set of available modules, without fear of physically overwriting modules provided with the distribution base or by other layered distributions. * To make it easy for distributions that add modules to declare that a set of modules is sharable (as defined below) with the modules provided by any distribution associated with a given identity (including the modules provided by the distribution base) * To establish clear rules for how distributions that add modules that must take precedence over sharable modules with the same name and slot provided by other distributions should:* locate those modules * indicate at launch time to the modular classloading system which set of distribution specific non-sharable modules should be used * To make it easy for end users to alter the module path for their own purposes by setting $JBOSS_MODULEPATH without needing to concern themselves with details of how the modules provided by the distribtuion base, layered distributions, or add-ons relate to one another. Reserve the use of $JBOSS_MODULEPATH and the value of the -mp command line argument passed to jboss-modules for end use uses. h2. Sharability Rules All modules provided as part of the distribution base are shareable. When the distribution base includes a module it accepts the following: * The version of the module it provides will take precedence over the +shareable+ version provided by any layered distribution or any module provide by an add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any layered distribution or add-on based that version of the distribution base. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the distribution base cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another layered distribution or add-on, even if the distribution base itself no longer needs that module. A layered distribution can provide both shareable and non-shareable modules. +TODO the next two sections are wrong -- a layered dist's modules are all shareable with respect to and valid add-ons or any other layered dist *allowed* to depend upon it. There is no sharable/non-sharable distinction.+ If a layered distribution declares that a given module is "shareable", it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the layered distribution is associated: * The distribution base may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the sharable module provided by the layered distribution. * Another layered distribution or add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * Another layered distribution or add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other layered distribution or add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any layered distribution or add-on based on the same major version of the identity. * The distribution base cannot depend upon a sharable module provided by a layered distribution. * An add-on associated with an identity can depend upon shareable modules provided by any layered distribution associated with the identity. Further, other layered distributions within the same identity can also can depend up a shareable module provided by the layered distribution. As a result, if a layered distribution provides shareable shareable modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons or layered distribution. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the layered distribution cannot remove a shareable module that is depended upon by an add-on or another layered-distribution, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module.

Assume also that patches named base-1, abc-1, def-1, vuw-1, xyz-1 and xyz-2 have been applied. The module loader would look for modules on the filesystem in following locations, starting with first and terminating as soon as the module is found: /user/me/my-modules /modules (in case the user placed modules directly in under this directory) /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-1 /modules/layers/xyz /modules/layers/vuw/patches/vuw-1 /modules/layers/vuw /modules/layers/base/patches/base-1 /modules/layers/base /modules/add-ons/abc/patches/abc-1 /modules/add-ons/abc /modules/add-ons/def/patches/def-1 /modules/add-ons/def The precedence order between /modules/add-ons/abc and /modules/add-ons/def is arbitrary. An add-on should never assume its modules will take precedence over those of any other add-on's modules. The fact that the various patches locations are included in the path is entirely due to +metadata+ that the patching tool will store in the $JBOSS_HOME/patches directory. The mere presence of a directory like /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 is insufficient to trigger inclusion of that directory in the module search path. However, when the patching tool installs the patch, the actual location of the +module contents+ will be in /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 -- only patching related metadata will be stored in $JBOSS_HOME/patches. This behavior is important for allowing sharing of modules across installations. h2. Sharing Modules Across Installations The above behavior makes it relatively straightforward for a user to share modules across installations. For example, the user could set up a shared module repo in /user/me with the following structure jboss-module-repo + add-ons ++ abc ++ def + layers ++ base ++ vuw ++ xyz The $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal location in each installation on the filesystem could then be replaced with a symlink to /user/me/jboss-module-repo. The downside to this very simple sharing is the abc and def add-ons will be visible and used by all installations, whether or not they are relevant to the installation's identity. A solution to this problem would be to do more symlinks: $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/layers -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/layers $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/add-ons/abc -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/abc $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/add-ons/def -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/def As an improvement at some point we could define some sort of file format (say xml) and allow a file with that format to be placed in $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal in lieu of the subdirectories. The file would include all of the mapping information for the external repo. The patching tool or any programmatic installers would know how to read and update that file. The file would only include information for the add-ons relevant to the installation. h3. Implications for the Patching Tool The possibility of module sharing doesn't remove the requirement to apply a patch to each installation on a given filesystem. Applying the patch to each installation is required in order to: *  update any miscellaneous files * record the patching metadata for the particular installation * allow the patching tool to understand what combinations of layered distributions and add-ons are relevant to the given installation However, the patching tool should recognize the possibility of this kind of module sharing. When it applies a patch it should recognize that the modules may already exist on the filesystem and should not apply them again if not necessary. It should however record some information in, e.g. /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 indicating that the installation being patched is using that set of patch modules. This information will prevent deletion of patch modules used by multiple installations if one of the installations uses the patching feature's cleanup functions. h1. OSGi Bundle Loading This needs discussion, but the basic concept is the precedence rules for OSGi bundle loading would following the same rules as for module loading.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Layered Distributions and Module Path Organization</header>
    <body>h1. +*This is an article outlining some thoughts by the author*+ +(Brian Stansberry)++*. It is not an official design of the JBoss AS 7 project.*+ h1. Overview This document describes notions for how different software distributions based on the JBoss AS 7 project can integrate with the base AS and with each other in a controlled manner. +* *+ h1. Fundamental Concepts h2. Distribution A coherent set of software produced by a "project" or a "product". JBoss AS 7 is a project. JBoss EAP is such a product. Both play similar technical roles in the JBoss ecosystem, but there are significant differences in how the two are made available to end users. This article uses "distribution" as a replacement for constantly saying "project/product" everywhere. It's not a great term; if someone has a better one, please suggest it. h2. Distribution Base The "distribution base" is the core set of modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that is common to all layered distributions. It may itself be usable standalone project or product. Currently the software produced by the JBoss AS 7 project and the JBoss EAP product are the distribution bases relevant to this discussion. In the future a more limited subset of functionality may become the distribution base, with the full set of functionality currently provided in community AS and EAP coming as layered distributions or add-ons. h2. Layered Distribution A distribution that builds on top of the distribution base, potentially superceding some of the distribution base's functionality. A layered distribution is allowed to supercede any aspect of the distribution base's functionality. The less the layered distribution does this, the easier it will be for the layered distribution to manage things like patching, but, if necessary, a layered distribution can supercede anything in the distribution base. A layered distribution build on top of another layered distribution, provided it has worked out the necessary procedures to ensure compatibility. h2. Identity An identity is a named set of distribution base + layered distribution(s) that is certified as a valid combination. The distribution base by itself may or may not be a valid identity. Currently it is; in the future it may not be. The software produced by a given layered distribution may be associated with more than one identity. h3. Patching and Identities Patches are applicable to an identity. A given patch can apply to more than one identity, if there are no conflicts between the identities in terms of how they use the items modified by a patch. The metadata associated with a patch will indicate the identities to which it is applicable. Patches are comprised of one or more discrete +patch elements+ each of which is produced by the distribution base or by one of the layered distributions associated with the identity. A patch element includes metadata describing the element along with any added or modified files. The patch element metadata will identify the provider of the patch component. A given patch element can be used in multiple different patches. For example, a patch element upgrading the distribution base can be included in several patches produced by different identities, with each patch also including a patch element upgrading a layered distribution used in that identity. For example, let's say an identity named A consists of the distribution base and a layered distribution named A. Version 1.0 of identity A is based on version 2.0 of the distribution base and version 1.0 of layered distribution A. The distribution base produces a patch element that will move it to version 2.1. The producers of the A identity could then produce a patch that will result in version 1.1 of identity A. This would include a patch element upgrading layered distribution A to its version 1.1, as well as the separate element that provides the distribution base upgrade to its 2.1. There are two main benefits of this sharing approach: * The modules and bundles provided by the distribution base upgrade are associated with the original 2.1 patch provided by the distribution base, not just with the enclosing patch provided by A. This will make possible the sharing of modules/bundles provided by patches across installations. * Incorporating one patch within another as a simple discrete unit helps avoid errors during patch production. For modules and bundles within a patch, once the patch is applied the association of the module or bundle with the distribution base or layer that provided it is retained within the installation. The association is encoded within the filesystem path that points to the patch version of the module or bundle. Miscellaneous files within a patch are not associated with the distribution base or any particular layered distribution once they are installed. For example bin/standalone.sh is bin/standalone.sh no matter what patch component added or modified it. Each identity produces a patch stream. Because a given patch can apply to more than one identity, the same patch can appear in multiple patch streams. The distribution base and layered distributions can produces +patch elements+ but they cannot themselves produce +patches+ or a patch stream. Since a patch must be associated with an an identity, only an identity (or a group of cooperating identities) can produce a patch. If there is an identity that consists of nothing but the distribution base, that identity can produce a patch. But this is logically not the same thing as saying the distribution base itself produced the patch, even though the practical effect is similar. h2. Installation An installation is a single filesystem location containing the distribution base plus zero or more layered distributions. It includes the bin/ dir from which processes are launched. The root of the installation is the path indicated by the $JBOSS_HOME environment variable referred to in the scripts and indicated by the jboss.home.dir system property used in the java code. h3. Installation Identity Each installation has a *+single identity+*. Because an installation only has a single identity, there is no confusion as to which layered distribution "owns" a particular filesystem location in that installation. Further, because the identity of an installation can be easily determined (see "Establishing Identity" below), external tools can quickly understand the functionality provided by a given installation, even if no process is currently running from the installation. +TODO further spell out the importance of single identity.+ h3. Sharing Files Across Installations+ + The files that comprise modules and bundles are potentially sharable across installations. Making it easy for users to do this should be a key goal. Miscellaneous files are not sharable across installations. An end user could potentially share them using symlinks, but doing so is not a supported feature nor is it a recommended practice. Patches are not sharable across installations. The +modules and bundles that the patch provides+ are potentially sharable, but the miscellaneous files provided by a patch are not sharable. The patching history metadata that the patching tool records in the installation is also not sharable -- the metadata is associated with the given installation. However, making it easy to share the the modules and bundles provide by a patch across installations should be a key goal. h2. Add-On Distribution An add-on distribution is a set of software that extends the capabilities of a given "identity". An add-on can only extend capabilities. It is not allowed to supercede capabilities of the identity it extends. For modules and OSGi bundles, the module and bundle loading logic provided by the distribution base will enforce this behavior. For miscellaneous files, it is up to the people providing an add-on to ensure that the add-on does not overwrite any file provided by the distribution base, any layered distribution associated with the identity or any other add-ons associated with the identity. Conversely, once the providers of an identity have accepted an add-on into their ecosystem, it is their responsibility to ensure that they do not add any files to their distributions that will conflict with files already provided by the add-on. In practice, the most likely sources of conflict will be the xml files in the configuration directories and the .conf files in the bin directory. Conflicts over xml files are solvable by having add-on providers ship their own xml file variants rather than attempting to modify the standard ones that ship with the identity. A given add-on is allowed to extend the capabilities of more than one identity. An add-on may require the presence of other add-ons. h3. Patching and Add-ons Add-on distributions produce their own patch stream. The patches produced by an add-on indicate the versions of the identity that must be present for the patch to apply. More than one identity can be listed, since add-ons may be applicable to multiple identities. The patches produced by an add-on also indicate the existing version of the add-on that must be present, as well as the version of any other required add-ons. Add-ons cannot use patches in their own stream to fix problems in the identity on which they depend. Add-ons depend on the patch stream provided by their dependent identity to provide such fixes. Modules and bundles provided by an add-on or its patches will have lower precedence in the module loading order than those that come from the distribution base or layered distributions, so any fix to such a module/bundle provided by an add-on patch will have no effect. h1. Installers +TODO discussion of RPM+ h2. Distribution Base Installers The distribution base can be installed via a simple unzip. If the distribution base is itself an identity, see also "Identity Installers" h2. Identity Installers An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that already contains a depended upon identity or the installation base of a zip that only includes the layered distribution(s) to be added. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an identity is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is irrevocably changed.+* When an identity is installed it has the right to modify any miscellaneous files in the installation filesystem, so once an identity is installed, the identity of the installation is changed. In many (hopefully nearly all) cases it may be possible for a user to remove files added by an identity install and get the installation back to its previous identity, but doing this is not a supported feature of the software and is not a recommended practice. *+However, once support for installing patches via the patching tool is available, reverting an identity installation will be possible.+* The patching tool maintains backup copies of any miscellaneous files modified by a patch, making it possible to restore those files. h2. Add-on Installer An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions along with the add-on itself. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that contains the depended upon identity of a zip that only includes the add-on. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an add-on is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is not changed, and it must be possible to reverse the installation.+* An add-on is merely additive, so removing it is a matter of deleting what was added. This could be done via a script provided by the add-on, via an installer program, or manually by a user following a set of instructions. h1. Establishing Identity It +must+ be possible for external tools to determine the identity of a given installation without requiring the software based on that installation to be running. It's also necessary for the software based on an installation to determine its own identity. This will be done via the bin/product.conf file located in the distribution. This file will include: * The name of the identity * The name of any layered distributions used by the identity, in order of the precedence to be used when loading their modules. If no bin/product.conf file exists, the installation is assumed to be the community version of the distribution base. If no layered distributions are named in the file, only the base and any add-ons will be used. h1. Module Loading JBoss AS currently loads modules based on a "module path" which is a list of filesystem locations which JBoss Modules searches for modules. In our standard launch scripts, users are able to manipulate this module path by setting the $JBOSS_MODULEPATH environment variable. If not set, $JBOSS_MODULEPATH is set to $JBOSS_HOME/modules. This mechanism creates a single default location under which modules can be located. This is problematic when layered distributions and add-ons wish to install their own modules, since there are no clear rules as to how those modules should be installed or how they relate to one another. h2. Goals * To make it easy for layered distributions or add-ons to add their modules to the set of available modules or remove their modules from the set of available modules, without fear of physically overwriting modules provided by others. * To establish clear rights and responsibilities for providers of the distribution base, layered distributions and add-ons with respect to how their modules should be managed. * To establish clear rules for how distributions that add modules that must take precedence over other modules provided by other distributions with the same name and slot should:* locate those modules * indicate at launch time to the modular classloading system the precedence order * To make it easy for end users to alter the module path for their own purposes by setting $JBOSS_MODULEPATH without needing to concern themselves with details of how the modules provided by the distribtuion base, layered distributions, or add-ons relate to one another. Reserve the use of $JBOSS_MODULEPATH and the value of the -mp command line argument passed to jboss-modules for end use uses. h2. Rights and Responsibilities of Module Providers All modules provided as part of the distribution base can be depended upon by any add-on associated with an identity. If the distribution base by itself is an identity (i.e. with no additional layered distribution required), the providers of the distribution base accept the following with respect to that identity: * The version of the module the distribution base provides will take precedence over a module with the same name and slot provided by any add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch will need to be tested for compatibility with add-ons based on the version of the identity being patched. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the distribution base cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the distribution base itself no longer needs that module. If the distribution base is part of an identity along with one or more layered distributions, the providers of the distribution base accept the following with respect to that identity: * The distribution base has the same responsibilities with respect to add-ons that it has in the case of add-ons without any layered distribution. * However, if a layered distribution in an identity provides a module with the same name and slot as the one provided by the distribution base, the distribution base no longer has responsibility to provide the module. The layered distribution's version of the module takes precedence. * The distribution base can modify a module that is depended upon by a layered distribution in a way that breaks functionality of the layered distribution. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the distribution base before making them available for use with the identity. If the distribution base patch element in some way breaks the functionality of an identity, either the patch element should not be provided for the identity, or the patch that incorporates the distribution base patch element should also include a layered distribution patch element that fixes the problem.* However, the distribution base should take great care not to break layered distributions with which it is associated when it produces patch elements. Distribution base patch element production should involve reasonable testing of all relevant identities such that problems can be found and resolved before the distribution base patch element ships. * The distribution base can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on but which is depended upon by a layered distribution. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the distribution base before making them available for use with the identity. If the distribution base removes a module depended upon by a layered distribution, the patch that incorporates the distribution base patch element should also include a layered distribution patch element that adds the module as part of the layered distribution. * If an identity add-on depends on a module provided by the distribution base and the distribution base wishes to remove the module, that is allowed provided some layered distribution is willing to begin providing the same module in an overall patch. All modules provided as part of a layered distribution can be depended upon by any add-on associated with an identity. They cannot be depended upon by the distribution base. When a layered distribution includes a module it accepts the following: * The version of the module it provides will take precedence over a module with the same name and slot provided by the distribution base or by any add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch element will need to be tested for compatibility with add-ons based on that version of the identity. Any functionality provided by the distribution base and supported by the identity will also have to be tested. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the layered distribution cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the layered distribution itself no longer needs that module. * A layered distribution can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on. If a layered distribution participates in an identity with another layered distribution that depends on it, the depended-on layer accepts the following: * If the dependent layered distribution provides a module with the same name and slot as the one provided by the depended-on layer, the depended-on layer no longer has responsibility to provide the module to the dependent or to any add-ons. The dependent layered distribution's version of the module takes precedence. * The depended-on layer can modify a module that is depended upon by another layer in a way that breaks functionality of the dependent. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the component layers before making them available for use with the identity. If the depended-on layer's patch element in some way breaks the functionality of an identity, either the patch should not be provided for the identity, or the patch element that incorporates the depended-on layer's patch component should also include a patch element to a dependent layer that fixes the problem.* However, a depended-on layer should take great care not to break dependent layers when it produces patch elements. Layered distribution patch production should involve reasonable testing of all relevant identities such that problems can be found and resolved before the depended-on layer's patch ships. * A depended-on layer can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on but which is depended upon by another layer. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by a depended-upon layered distribution before making them available for use with the identity. If the depended-upon layer removes a module that is depended upon by another layer, the patch that incorporates the depended-upon layer's patch element should also include a patch element from the dependent layer distribution that adds the module as part of that layered distribution. * If an add-on depends on a module provided by the layered distribution and the layered distribution wishes to remove the module, that is allowed provided some other layered distribution in the identity is willing to begin providing the same module in an overall patch. When an add-on includes a module, it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the add-on is associated: * The distribution base or a layered distribution may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the module provided by the add-on. * Another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * Another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of the depended-upon module in a patch element will need to be tested for compatibility with any add-on based on the same major version of the identity.* The providers of the add-on are responsible for providing an adequate set of tests to the providers of the identity. * The distribution base or a layered distribution cannot depend upon a module provided by an add-on. * As a consequence of the previous point, an add-on can remove a module in a patch, without fear of breaking the core functionality of an identity. * An add-on can depend up a shareable module provided by another add-on upon which it depends, but +only with the express consent of the providers of that add-on+. Such dependencies are strongly discouraged. * If an add-on allows another add-on to depend upon its modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons. Testing procedures must be created to ensure that any patches produced by the depended-upon add-on do not break the dependent add-on. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the add-on cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another add-on, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module. h2. Module Organization on the Filesystem This section will describe how the above points are reflected in the actual organization of modules on the filesystem. h4. Requirement for Standardized Module Loading JBoss Modules can support other mechanisms for finding module content and loading it besides the filesystem-based module path mechanism. Theoretically a custom boot module loader implementation could be specified at process launch, with that module loader using some other means for locating module content. This article proposes that this capability be declared as unsupported for JBoss AS and products based upon it. Rather, the AS will have a specified boot module loader implementation. Users of the AS community project are free to use a non-standard boot module loader implementation, but if they do so and certain features provided by the AS don't work, that is their problem. h3. Filesystem Layout Modules would be organized on the filesystem as follows: modules + internal ++ add-ons +++ abc +++ def ++ layers +++ base +++ vuw +++ xyz The internal level exists to separate modules associated with the distribution base, layered distribution or add-ons from those the end user may store in the modules directory. +TODO Some better name for internal would be nice.+ h3. Translation of Filesystem Layout into Module Loading Precedence For any location provided by the user via the -mp switch, the module loader will look for the internal structure. If it is found in more than one location, an exception will be thrown. The module loader will understand the structure above and will apply module loading precedence rules as follows. Assume the above structure exists under $JBOSS_HOME and that the user sets $JBOSS_MODULEPATH as follows JBOSS_MODULESPATH=/user/me/my-modules;$JBOSS_HOME/modules In addition, the bin/product.conf file declares that the identity of the install is xyz, the xyz layered distribution should be loaded and the xyz layered distribution depends on the vuw layered distribution. Assume also that patches named base-1, abc-1, def-1, vuw-1, xyz-1 and xyz-2 have been applied. The module loader would look for modules on the filesystem in following locations, starting with first and terminating as soon as the module is found: /user/me/my-modules /modules (in case the user placed modules directly in under this directory) /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-1 /modules/layers/xyz /modules/layers/vuw/patches/vuw-1 /modules/layers/vuw /modules/layers/base/patches/base-1 /modules/layers/base /modules/add-ons/abc/patches/abc-1 /modules/add-ons/abc /modules/add-ons/def/patches/def-1 /modules/add-ons/def The precedence order between /modules/add-ons/abc and /modules/add-ons/def is arbitrary. An add-on should never assume its modules will take precedence over those of any other add-on's modules. The fact that the various patches locations are included in the path is entirely due to +metadata+ that the patching tool will store in the $JBOSS_HOME/patches directory. The mere presence of a directory like /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 is insufficient to trigger inclusion of that directory in the module search path. However, when the patching tool installs the patch, the actual location of the +module contents+ will be in /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 -- only patching related metadata will be stored in $JBOSS_HOME/patches. This behavior is important for allowing sharing of modules across installations. h2. Sharing Modules Across Installations The above behavior makes it relatively straightforward for a user to share modules across installations. For example, the user could set up a shared module repo in /user/me with the following structure jboss-module-repo + add-ons ++ abc ++ def + layers ++ base ++ vuw ++ xyz The $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal location in each installation on the filesystem could then be replaced with a symlink to /user/me/jboss-module-repo. The downside to this very simple sharing is the abc and def add-ons will be visible and used by all installations, whether or not they are relevant to the installation's identity. A solution to this problem would be to do more symlinks: $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/layers -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/layers $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/add-ons/abc -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/abc $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/add-ons/def -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/def As an improvement at some point we could define some sort of file format (say xml) and allow a file with that format to be placed in $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal in lieu of the subdirectories. The file would include all of the mapping information for the external repo. The boot module loader, patching tool and any programmatic installers would know how to read and update that file. The file would only include information for the add-ons relevant to the installation. h3. Implications for the Patching Tool The possibility of module sharing doesn't remove the requirement to apply a patch to each installation on a given filesystem. Applying the patch to each installation is required in order to: *  update any miscellaneous files * record the patching metadata for the particular installation * allow the patching tool to understand what combinations of layered distributions and add-ons are relevant to the given installation However, the patching tool should recognize the possibility of this kind of module sharing. When it applies a patch it should recognize that the modules may already exist on the filesystem and should not apply them again if not necessary. It should however record some information in, e.g. /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 indicating that the installation being patched is using that set of patch modules. This information will prevent deletion of patch modules used by multiple installations if one of the installations uses the patching feature's cleanup functions. h1. OSGi Bundle Loading This needs discussion, but the basic concept is the precedence rules for OSGi bundle loading would following the same rules as for module loading.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Authentication Service</header>
    <body>h1. Authentication Service This article is do describe the new authentication service being added to AS7 to support security context proagation and connection re-authentication.  Until the component is complete this article should be considered work in progress. Due to the dependencies involved this service is developed as a stand alone project that will be subsequently integrated into the application server, most likely the security subsystem. h3. Project Structure The project (will) provide(s) the following: - h4. Authentication Service This is the core service running within the application server, this service is associated with all supported security realms and handles the authentication requests and the providing of the authenticated identities internally. h4. Server API Fer secured services looking to use the identities an API will be provided for direct access to the service.  A permissions check on the SecurityManager (if any) will be performed to verify the call should be allowed, user code must not be able to interact with the service unless that permission is granted. The server API may also provide an API that can be mapped to domain management operations to allow the state of the authentication service and the connection to be managed. h4. Internal Client API On the client side calls will be made to the remote authentication service using the defined protocol over Remoting - to simplify the use of the protocol this will be wrapped by an API - however this is most likely not the API that the clients will use to manage the associated identities. h4. Public Client API This is the API that will be used by client applications to manipulate the identities associated with the current connection, use cases are being identified and the resulting API will be to solve those use cases. The current discussions are along the lines that this will re-introduce the concept of a SecurityContext on the client side - this SecurityContext will allow the association of many identities that can then be selected for the actual invocations. h4. Versioned Remoting Protocol The protocol itself will live in it's own module, client and server side of the protocol will be written in parallel to ensure they remain in synch.  h3. Remoting Protocol The protocol is a versioned protocol, this means that the client and server will negotiate to use the most up to date protocol that both sides understand.  The only exception to this is that both sides will also allow for versions to be excluded either through configuration, their APIs or by system properties - the reason for this is that if a vulnerability or bug is found in a version of the protocol it can be excluded - this is applicable even for older versions as you may not want a client to force the use of an older version with a known issue. The versioning will also indicate if the protocol version is from a Final release or an intermediate release, backwards compatibility is only maintained within a protocol once it has reached the final state. h3. Security Permissions and Policies The ability to both manipulate the client side SecurityContexts and the ability to access the service AND any associations with the Remoting Connection will be strictly protected using Permissions and the Java SecurityManager.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Authentication Service</header>
    <body>h1. Authentication Service This article is do describe the new authentication service being added to AS7 to support security context proagation and connection re-authentication.  Until the component is complete this article should be considered work in progress. Due to the dependencies involved this service is developed as a stand alone project that will be subsequently integrated into the application server, most likely the security subsystem. h3. Project Structure The project (will) provide(s) the following: - h4. Authentication Service This is the core service running within the application server, this service is associated with all supported security realms and handles the authentication requests and the providing of the authenticated identities internally. h4. Server API Fer secured services looking to use the identities an API will be provided for direct access to the service.  A permissions check on the SecurityManager (if any) will be performed to verify the call should be allowed, user code must not be able to interact with the service unless that permission is granted. The server API may also provide an API that can be mapped to domain management operations to allow the state of the authentication service and the connection to be managed. h4. Internal Client API On the client side calls will be made to the remote authentication service using the defined protocol over Remoting - to simplify the use of the protocol this will be wrapped by an API - however this is most likely not the API that the clients will use to manage the associated identities. Reporting the internal reasons for authentication failure to a client is generally bad - however despite this there are a lot of users asking that error messages can be sent to client.  By default we should keep the errors server side only but do allow propagation to be switched on. h4. Public Client API This is the API that will be used by client applications to manipulate the identities associated with the current connection, use cases are being identified and the resulting API will be to solve those use cases. The current discussions are along the lines that this will re-introduce the concept of a SecurityContext on the client side - this SecurityContext will allow the association of many identities that can then be selected for the actual invocations. h4. Versioned Remoting Protocol The protocol itself will live in it's own module, client and server side of the protocol will be written in parallel to ensure they remain in synch.  h3. Remoting Protocol The protocol is a versioned protocol, this means that the client and server will negotiate to use the most up to date protocol that both sides understand.  The only exception to this is that both sides will also allow for versions to be excluded either through configuration, their APIs or by system properties - the reason for this is that if a vulnerability or bug is found in a version of the protocol it can be excluded - this is applicable even for older versions as you may not want a client to force the use of an older version with a known issue. The versioning will also indicate if the protocol version is from a Final release or an intermediate release, backwards compatibility is only maintained within a protocol once it has reached the final state. h3. Security Permissions and Policies The ability to both manipulate the client side SecurityContexts and the ability to access the service AND any associations with the Remoting Connection will be strictly protected using Permissions and the Java SecurityManager. The development must output documented sample security policies that demonatrate how to grant the required permissions, the AS integration will also build on this to demonstrate the policy required server side. As a stand alone project the testsuite of the project should also include full testing with a security manager and the sample policies. h3. Application Server Integration h4. Configuration Items to be configured within the application server: - The service itself is a generic service, initially this is being used for EJB invocations however this can potentially be used for all services so the configuration of the service needs to be central - I would suggest within the security subsystem. The service will only be installed if the configuration is present. * Available Realms * Advertise Realms?  Should clients be able to request a list of available realms. * SASL Configuration - the capabilities of the realms guide this but additional overrides may be needed. * Caching configuration - validity periods? limit per connection? * Error propagation. h4. EJB Container The EJB container will need to be modified so that if a request is received with a token ID then the Server API should be used to obtain that identity and run the request as that identity. Where a call is being made to a remote server there needs to be some form of switch to enable propagating the identity to the remote server, this most likely needs an API option and a configuration option to enable it. h4. EJB Clients The EJB client side in conjunction with the public client API will need to support the client side management and switching of identities and the passing of the selected token with the method invocation. h4. Security Realms The security realms now need to be updated as to support this feature a user authenticating to the server needs to be able request an alternative id for the authorization decisions.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: JAR blacklist for	deployment</header>
    <body>I actually has a monologue on the topic on the irc channel on dec 18 on the topic ;-) [20:37:27] &lt;nickarls&gt; wonder if it would be difficult to take the example subsystem from "Extending JBoss AS 7" and make it a pluggable "Deployment sanity checker"? You could e.g. throw in a "hibernate" check module which would warn if you have bundled hibernate jars accidently etc... [20:46:24] &lt;nickarls&gt; obsolete configuration files check, zipped war in exploded ear check, too-old-spring-version check etc. of course, the general deployers could be improved but these would be pluggable (and could be more verbose) Like I said, it would be nice if the architechture would be pluggable and the JAR check would be one component You might want to check what options JBoss Modules has for querying the module repository. Does it have a "what provides"-function for a class or can you list all jars in the module an match against regexp-patterns etc....</body>

    <body>As for the interface, perhaps something like public interface DeploymentValidator might do. Or then DeploymentPhaseContext as parameter. I'm not sure what would be the best way in JBoss Modules to add validation implementation JARs without having to list them explicitly in some module.xml. Perhaps the standard ServiceLoader mechanism is applicable.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - General Synchronizing Merge	with JBPM</header>
    <body>Hi Folks, i want to realize a simple version of the Workflow Control Pattern no. 38 ( http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/new/wcp38.php http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/new/wcp38.php) with JBPM. Officialy the Pattern is not supported by JBPM, but however i am looking for a possibility to realize it. My Process is an order quotation process. In the first step the bids are send out. After that the process should wait until n of m suppliers replied. When this is true, the process should go on with a compare an an order task. I tried to use a conditional event task in combination with a rule but it doesn´t work right. The process doesn´t wait for the required number of repiles but he restarts. How can i realize my requirement with JBPM? In the attachment you will find a simple draft of the process. Kind regards Dekay</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Every single remote ejb call starts full authentication process with SecurityDomain cache-type="default"</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm facing the same issue with local ejb calls in an app bundled as a war.  I'm not using a custom login module.  I'm using DatabaseUsers.  I noticed the issue with v. 7.1.1.Final when I implemented a "change user password" workflow when immediately after the new password was persisted to the db JBossCachedAuthenticationManager threw a FailedLoginException.  I deployed to 7.1.2.Final as well as 7.2.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT.  I double checked that cache-type="default" was in my configuration after reading about the issue in  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-3498 jira: AS7-3498.   However this did not resolve the problem.  AS7-3498 was closed in March?? 15:50:06,756 ERROR [org.jboss.security.authentication.JBossCachedAuthenticationManager] (http-/127.0.0.1:8443-6) Login

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Test failures	with JDK7</header>
    <body>Sure. But I want a stable version of AS7. If test fails, it might be a problem of the test case, but also of the application server itself. I also tried a version compiled with JDK6 and run with JDK7. Here I get expeptions from our C/C++-application calling a webservice running on AS7: HTTP/1.1 505 HTTP Version Not Supported. Strange. Running the same build with JDK6 again does not this problem. So it seems its better to stay with JDK6, although it will run out of public support early in 2013.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Inter-module injection - the easy way (or even any way or alternative approaches)?</header>
    <body>I am trying unsuccessfully to get Inter-module injection working.  I expected that I could have a cdi-enabled war @Inject beans from a bean archive in the same container after haing added a dependency to the bean-archive-as-module in the war's jboss-deployment-structure.xml file My ultimate goal is to enable a rapid development process for our team where developers working on the front end redeploy just a lean war that does not contain any backend services but has a module dependency on a "services" deployable (which is currently an ear but could be just a jar if need be).  Devs doing front-end work would ideally just @Inject any local dependency located in the services deployable with minimal/zero per-service configuration fuss. The services deployable is a fairly time-consuming redeploy, and a frequent redeploy seems unneeded for developers just doing front-end work. Normally, I might have liked to accomplish this goal by using an exploded ear, where the war is part of the ear, and the front end developer can just redeploy the war portion of the ear after making,say, a java file change, and only the war is redeployed, not the entire ear (which again is slow and seemingly unneeded). Other apps servers that I've worked with in the past offer this specific functionality, but it appears that AS7 does not (unless, hopefully, I'm wrong). On AS7 it seems only the entire ear can be redeployed, even if just the war needs redeployment. So, I am looking for alternative approaches to accomplish the same goal, such as using a front-end war external to the services deployable that uses inter-module injection (as described  http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/1.0/html/injectionelresolution.html here under 5.1.4 in the CDI spec). However when I try this, I get "unsatisfied dependencies" errors.  I think I'm satisfying the requirements for inter-module injection (though the 4th part is unclear to me - "the bean class is required to be accessible to classes in the module, according to the class accessibility requirements of the module architecture"). I have confirmed that my war (which has a  reference in jboss-deployment-structure.xml to the ear module and to the ejb-jar subdeployment inside the ear) can do a jndi lookup for an example EJB using "java:global/my-ear.ear/my-ejb.jar/SomeService", but @Inject can not find the same bean. I'm confident that a have cdi enabled on both the war and on the ear (plus I've tried just a simple bean archive jar instead of my full-blown ear). Any workarounds or alternative approaches would be most welcome. Thanks all, #Tom</body>

    <body>The CDI spec statement has an implied "according to the class accessibility requirements of the module architecture of the Java EE specification". Even if the classloading could be configured in an AS to do some special trick, CDI has the visibility rules of a standard EE app (EAR/WAR/JAR). 3rd party tools as JRebel are handy for doing front-end work that don't require heavy backing bean/entity reloads.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Inter-module injection - the easy way (or even any way or alternative approaches)?</header>
    <body>Thanks much for your response and alternative productivity tip, JRebel. JRebel is a great tool , and I am already using it, but it only goes so far, and still requires redeploy for a variety of circumstances. Further, I'd like to find a solution for the team and the community at large that doesn't require a tool such JRebel, since not all folks and teams can obtain or manage use of JRebel. What you characterize as a "special trick", I might characterize as a "useful application of the wonderful JBoss module system"  :) It sounds like you are saying based on this spec that EARs, WARs, and even JARs should not have class visibility from say, another war.  If that is true, then it seems like the Inter-module injection part of the spec can never be satisfied in any useful way, since that class accessibility requirement can never be satisfied. Also, I can sort of understand this tight accessibility restriction for EARs and WARs, but surely just JAR deployables are accessible by other deployables, since jar deployable are basically the same as a module. I thought there was even a concept of a "bean archive" jar that other deployables can take advantage. Also, I'm a bit surprised that such an action is considered violating the visibility rules, since the classes are accessible.visible via jndi lookup and via Class.forName().  Unless I'm missing something, it seems like an inconsistency then that one can then currently do an @EJB("java:/global/my-ejb-jar.jar/SomeBean") but not do a simpler @Inject instead. The classes are clearly accessible from a jndi lookup perspective and and a Class.forName() perspective, but not accessible from a CDI @Inject perspective. From inside the war, I'm even able to use the BeanManager instance from the dependent jar to do getBeans() on beans from the dependent jar to get at a jar bean, but not with @Inject. Assuming there is no such solution, might it be possible to roll my own solution using a CDI hook/extension? If I am able to hook into the CDI bean resolution logic in the front-end war (I haven't studied if/how this can be done), then I would be able to lookup across the module using the technique that I have working described above where I have a bridge into the dependent jar exposing that deployable's BeanManager. ~Tom</body>

First you need to hook up the MDR to the DMR model under subsystem/jca/mdr, and make operations available to query it. Then the domain model infrastructure will take care of the rest, and you can have your standalone client access it that way.

    <body>My point is that you can't access the service directly from a standalone client. You have to have a layer in-between - in this case DMR.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Call statefulKnowledgeSession.startProcess() from an SessionBean</header>
    <body>Hi folks, i would like to call startProcess() and completeWorkItem() on a StatefulKnowledgeSession. Therefore I've an SessionBean and and j2ee-client application. I call the startProcess from my client and delegates them to the SessionBean. The SessionBean itself does some logic and after that, they should call startProcess() or something else on the current running JBPM application. But how could I get a reference to the JPAKnowledgeService or StateKnowledgeService or something else? Or a SessionBean which I could get from JNDI? I've tried some different approaches in the last hours, for example inject persistence unit and build an own Session around it, but without any success. Could someone point me to the right documentation please or post a code snippet? I'm using BRMS 5.3.0. Thanks in advance. Regards    Steffen...</body>

    <body>I have migrated our application from JBoss 4.0.5 to JBoss AS 7 and the only thing left to be completely done is to allow JBoss 7 to authenticate users via Kerberos SSO as we used to in JBoss 4.0.5. The documentation says that now I can simply use the standalone.xml and put the contents of my previous login-config.xml file in there and specify the type of authentication and necessary properties such as the SPN.   However, when I try to login I see this exception on my logs: +18:17:39,628 WARN  [org.jboss.security.auth.login.XMLLoginConfigImpl] (http-executor-threads - 10) *End loadConfig, failed to load config: file:/login-config.xml: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /login-config.xml (No such file or directory)*+ +          at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method) [classes.jar:1.6.0_22]+ +          at java.io.FileInputStream.&lt;init&gt;(FileInputStream.java:106) [classes.jar:1.6.0_22]+ +          at java.io.FileInputStream.&lt;init&gt;(FileInputStream.java:66) [classes.jar:1.6.0_22]+ +          at sun.net.www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection.connect(FileURLConnection.java:70) [classes.jar:1.6.0_22]+ +          at sun.net.www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection.getInputStream(FileURLConnection.java:161) [classes.jar:1.6.0_22]+ +          at java.net.URL.openStream(URL.java:1010) [classes.jar:1.6.0_22]+ +          at org.jboss.security.auth.login.XMLLoginConfigImpl.loadSunConfig(XMLLoginConfigImpl.java:440) [picketbox-4.0.7.Final.jar:4.0.7.Final]+ +          at org.jboss.security.auth.login.XMLLoginConfigImpl.loadConfig(XMLLoginConfigImpl.java:408) [picketbox-4.0.7.Final.jar:4.0.7.Final]+ +          at org.jboss.security.auth.login.XMLLoginConfigImpl.loadConfig(XMLLoginConfigImpl.java:379) [picketbox-4.0.7.Final.jar:4.0.7.Final]+ +          at org.jboss.security.auth.login.XMLLoginConfigImpl.refresh(XMLLoginConfigImpl.java:118) [picketbox-4.0.7.Final.jar:4.0.7.Final]+ This tells me that somehow JB7 is not aware that I'm trying to configure this information in the standalone.xml file and not in the login-config.xml.   I'm not even packaging that file anymore since the documentation says it is no longer used.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Web Services Development] - Re: SOAP Message validation now enabled by default?</header>
    <body>Apache CXF 2.4.9 is more strict in terms of message validations for security reasons. This is also required to deal with the vulnerability mentioned at  http://cxf.apache.org/cve-2012-3451.html http://cxf.apache.org/cve-2012-3451.html . Unfortunately, the only real solution here is fixing the wrong message. As a workaround, though, you might want to try setting the Apache CXF +soap.no.validate.parts+ property to true in the message context. Unfortunately, on server side that's not easily done in an effective way withouth introducing a dependency to apache cxf api; you should try adding + at org.apache.cxf.annotations.EndpointProperty(key = "soap.no.validate.parts", value = "true")+ to your endpoint impl class.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single Installation	Patching</header>
    <body>This article outlines design notes for the single instance patching feature being developed for AS 7.2. The 7.2 version of the feature will be apply to apply a patch to a single installation of the AS (i.e. a single unzip of the AS distribution.) That single installation may be being used for a standalone server or for a managed domain Host Controller and servers. However, the 7.2 version will not support coordinated patching by the patching tool of multiple installation in a managed domain. The user can of course independently patch multiple installation in a domain, coordinating the application of those patches themselves. The basic patching process will consist of: 1. The user obtains a patch file. 2. The user uses the CLI tool to connect to a standalone server or Host Controller that is running on the installation that is to be patched.1. The server or Host Controller may be running in admin-only mode or running normally. However, some patches may not be able to be applied if the target process isn't running in admin-only mode 3. The user invokes a command on the CLI providing the location of the patch file. The CLi invokes an operation(s) on the target process telling it to stage the patch. 4. The target process stages the patch by applying the patch contents to the filesystem.1. The changes made to the filesystem during staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before applying the patch. 5. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the staged patch is visible in the runtime. Patches can also be rolled back: 1. The user can use the CLI tool to instruct the target process to revert a patch. 2. Patch reversion results in changes to the filesystem that are staged in the same manner as what is done with a patch installation.1. The changes made to the filesystem during patch rollback staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch rollback with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before rolling back the patch. 3. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the rolled back patch is no longer visible in the runtime. h1. Patch File A patch file is a zip archive that contains a patch.xml file that is used to describe the patch along with the updated modules, OSGi bundles and miscellaneous files that comprise the patch. It's structure is as follows: + META-INF ++ patch.xml + modules ++ patch modules in the same structure as they appear the modules dir in the normal AS dist + bundles ++ patch bundles in the same structure as they appear the bundles dir in the normal AS dist + misc ++ misc files that need to be updated, organized in a directory structure that matches the directory structure of the AS dist h3. The patch.xml File The patch.xml file describes the patch. It includes basic information about the patch along with metadata about the modules, bundles and misc files in the patch. h5. Basic patch metadata * The name of the patch * The type of the patch (one-off vs cumulative, etc -- TODO list all) * The version to which the patch applies * A text description of the patch * TODO others h5. Module metadata * The name of the module * The slot of the module * The hash of the module.xml file of the previous version of the module. Not present if the relevant module did not exist in the version being patched. h5. Removed module metadata Identifies modules that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed module * The slot of the removed module h5. Bundle metadata * TODO anything? h5. Removed bundle metadata Identifies bundles that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed bundle h5. Misc file metadata * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file did not exist in the version being patched. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h5. Removed misc file metadata Identifies misc files that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h2. Patch Staging The target process when it applies a patch will create a patches directory directly underneath the root of the AS distribution. As with other directories, the location of this directory can be controlled via a system property passed to the JVM at process launch. Before patch staging begins, a check is made as to whether the target process is in admin-only mode. If it is not, and an unresolvable conflict is detected between a module, bundle or miscellaneous file contained in the patch and a user-modification of the corresponding item in the installation being patched, the patch staging process will be aborted with an error message.  See "Patch Conflict Detection" below. h4. Modules Patch modules will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. Information about the location of this directory will be stored in a location visible to the module loader used by JBoss Modules at boot.  This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the module loader currently in use by the target process. TODO describe check for user-modified modules. Information about removed modules will also be stored in a location visible to the boot module loader at next boot. h4. Bundles Patch bundes will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the OSGi subsystem currently in use by the target process. Information about removed bundles will also be stored in a location visible to the OSGi subsystem at next boot. h4. Misc files Misc files are staged by copying them directly to their normal location on the filesystem. A copy of the existing file at that location will be stored in the patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. TODO describe check for user-modified misc files. h4. Configuration files Patches will not modify the configuration files of the target process. Configuration patching will not be supported in this version of the feature (and may never be supported.)  Configuration files belong to the user. However, a copy of all existing configuration files will be made in a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. During patch rollback, these configuration files will be restored. This backup is necessary because once the patch is applied to the runtime, any management operation that results in persistence of the configuration will use the xml schemas associated with the patched version of the core AS and any subsystems. If the patch is reverted, those schemas may not be intelligible to the version of the code to which the runtime has been reverted. h2. Patch Application TODO h2. Rollback Staging To do a patch rollback, the target process must be placed in admin-only mode. TODO h4. Modules TODO h4. Bundles TODO h4. Misc Files The backup copies of the miscellaneous files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored to their normal locations. Any misc files that were added as part of the "Patch Staging" process (i.e. those that were new in the patch) will be removed. TODO h4. Configuration The backup copies of the configuration files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored. *+Any configuration changes made while the patch was in place will be lost.+* TODO h2. Rollback Application TODO Issue: the client tool (i.e. CLI) may need to be able to roll back a patch itself, not relying on the target process to do it. This is because a failed patch may leave the target process in a state such that it is unable to respond to commands from the CLI. This capability will not work remotely -- the CLI process will need to be running on the same machine as the installation being patched, and running under a user account with the necessary filesystem permissions to update the filesystem. h2. Patch Conflict Detection At the beginning of the patch staging process, a check will be made for conflicts between the patch and any user modifications to the same item. The user when executing the patch command can provide information to guide the tool in resolving conflicts. Any conflicts that cannot be resolved will result in the patch staging being aborted with no changes to the filesystem. Conflict types are: * Modules. If the patch is updating an existing module, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing module's module.xml file. The patching process will hash the current module.xml file to check for modifications. If any affected module is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some modules and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to module.xml, they will need to make an equivalent change to the module.xml in the patch module. The sole purpose of this "module conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Bundles: TODO * Misc files: If the patch is updating an existing misc file, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing ile. The patching process will hash the current file to check for modifications. If any affected file is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a permission indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. These permissions can come in two forms:* A global permission to update all misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tools patching command * A file containing a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is granted. The patching feature will also include a command that can apply this conflict detection process and provide a report of conflicts. Users can use this command to check for conflicts in advance. TODO describe how this will work for patch rollback. h2. Patch Generation Tool * Accepts basic metadata along with the location of a distribution of the new version along with a distribution of the old version* Also includes details on any misc files that are expected to be in active use * Generates a patch.xml file * Can generate a full patch file * Optional: Can be run from inside the bin/ dir of the full distribution of the new version and if provided with the patch.xml file can generate a patch file from the contents of the full dist* Idea here is the patch.xml file could be distributed as part of the new version and the user could use it to generate patch h4.

It's structure is as follows: + META-INF ++ patch.xml + modules ++ patch modules in the same structure as they appear the modules dir in the normal AS dist + bundles ++ patch bundles in the same structure as they appear the bundles dir in the normal AS dist + misc ++ misc files that need to be updated, organized in a directory structure that matches the directory structure of the AS dist h3. The patch.xml File The patch.xml file describes the patch. It includes basic information about the patch along with metadata about the modules, bundles and misc files in the patch. h5. Basic patch metadata * The name of the patch * The type of the patch (one-off vs cumulative, etc -- TODO list all) * The version to which the patch applies * A text description of the patch * TODO others h5. Module metadata * The name of the module * The slot of the module * The hash of the module.xml file of the previous version of the module. Not present if the relevant module did not exist in the version being patched. h5. Removed module metadata Identifies modules that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed module * The slot of the removed module h5. Bundle metadata * TODO anything? h5. Removed bundle metadata Identifies bundles that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed bundle h5. Misc file metadata * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file did not exist in the version being patched, or if the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h5. Removed misc file metadata Identifies misc files that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h2. Patch Staging The target process when it applies a patch will create a patches directory directly underneath the root of the AS distribution. As with other directories, the location of this directory can be controlled via a system property passed to the JVM at process launch. Before patch staging begins, a check is made as to whether the target process is in admin-only mode. If it is not, and an unresolvable conflict is detected between a module, bundle or miscellaneous file contained in the patch and a user-modification of the corresponding item in the installation being patched, the patch staging process will be aborted with an error message.  See "Patch Conflict Detection" below. h4. Modules Patch modules will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. Information about the location of this directory will be stored in a location visible to the module loader used by JBoss Modules at boot.  This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the module loader currently in use by the target process. TODO describe check for user-modified modules. Information about removed modules will also be stored in a location visible to the boot module loader at next boot. h4. Bundles Patch bundes will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the OSGi subsystem currently in use by the target process. Information about removed bundles will also be stored in a location visible to the OSGi subsystem at next boot. h4. Misc files Misc files are staged by copying them directly to their normal location on the filesystem. A copy of the existing file at that location will be stored in the patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. TODO describe check for user-modified misc files. h4. Configuration files Patches will not modify the configuration files of the target process. Configuration patching will not be supported in this version of the feature (and may never be supported.)  Configuration files belong to the user. However, a copy of all existing configuration files will be made in a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. During patch rollback, these configuration files will be restored. This backup is necessary because once the patch is applied to the runtime, any management operation that results in persistence of the configuration will use the xml schemas associated with the patched version of the core AS and any subsystems. If the patch is reverted, those schemas may not be intelligible to the version of the code to which the runtime has been reverted. h2. Patch Application A patch is "applied" by stopping the target process and then restarting it in a normal manner; e.g. from the command line or by using the :shutdown(restart=true) command from the CLI. The patch contents that have been staged are then used by the restarted process. h4. Modules In 7.2 the AS will use a custom implementation of the JBoss Modules ModuleLoader interface, instead of the default implementation used in previous AS 7 releases. The selection of this custom implementation will be part of the launch VM command created by the startup scripts (i.e. standalone.sh/standalone.bat/domain.sh/domain.bat). The module loader works using a notion of a "module path", which is an ordered list of directories in which modules are located. When the module loader needs to find a module, it searches the directories in that path in order, and once it finds the desired module the search ends. Thus, directories earlier in the path listing take precedence over those found later. This is all very similar to how an OS uses the $PATH environment variable. Previous AS7 releases allowed the user to specify a $JBOSS_MODULES_PATH environment variable to declare the "module path", with a default value of $JBOSS_HOME/modules used if not specified. The startup scripts used to the AS pass that module path into JBoss Modules (via the -mp &lt;the_path&gt; argument to java.)  In AS 7.2, the custom module loader we will use will support this behavior, but in addition the custom module loader we provide will be able to examine the patching metadata that will be persisted in the "staging" phase and from that will determine which of the patch-specific subdirectories of the patches directory need to be prepended to the module path. In addition, for modules that have been removed in patches, the custom module loader will know to not load those modules, even though the modules will still remain on the filesystem. h4. Bundles TODO -- basic idea is to do something similar to how modules work, but the details need to be sorted out. h4. Misc Files Application of miscellaneous files to the runtime is straightforward. The staging step places the patch's miscellaneous files in the normal location that the runtime services will expect, so when the target process is restarted, the runtime services see them. h2. Rollback Staging To do a patch rollback, the target process must be placed in admin-only mode. TODO h4. Modules TODO h4. Bundles TODO h4. Misc Files The backup copies of the miscellaneous files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored to their normal locations. Any misc files that were added as part of the "Patch Staging" process (i.e. those that were new in the patch) will be removed. h4. Configuration The backup copies of the configuration files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored. *+Any configuration changes made while the patch was in place will be lost.+* h2. Rollback Application A patch rollback is "applied" by stopping the target process and then restarting it in a normal manner; e.g. from the command line or by using the :shutdown(restart=true) command from the CLI. The modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that have been staged are then used by the restarted process. Issue: the client tool (i.e. CLI) may need to be able to roll back a patch itself, not relying on the target process to do it. This is because a failed patch may leave the target process in a state such that it is unable to respond to commands from the CLI. This capability will not work remotely -- the CLI process will need to be running on the same machine as the installation being patched, and running under a user account with the necessary filesystem permissions to update the filesystem. h4. Modules See the discussion in "Patch Application" above of how the module path works. When a patch is rolled back, the metadata the custom module loader uses to construct the module path will no longer indicate the patch's modules should be on the path, so they will not be available for loading. h4. Bundles TODO -- basic idea is to do something similar to how modules work, but the details need to be sorted out. h4. Misc Files As was the case in the discussion in "Patch Application" above, the patch rollback staging step places the correct miscellaneous files in the normal location that the runtime services will expect, so when the target process is restarted, the runtime services see them. h2. Patch Conflict Detection At the beginning of the patch staging process, a check will be made for conflicts between the patch and any user modifications to the same item. The user when executing the patch command can provide information to guide the tool in resolving conflicts. Any conflicts that cannot be resolved will result in the patch staging being aborted with no changes to the filesystem. Conflict types are: * Modules. If the patch is updating an existing module, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing module's module.xml file. The patching process will hash the current module.xml file to check for modifications. If any affected module is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some modules and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to module.xml, they will need to make an equivalent change to the module.xml in the patch module. The sole purpose of this "module conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Bundles: TODO * Misc files: If the patch is updating an existing misc file, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing ile. The patching process will hash the current file to check for modifications. If any affected file is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a permission indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. These permissions can come in two forms:* A global permission to update all misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tools patching command * A file containing a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is granted. The patching feature will also include a command that can apply this conflict detection process and provide a report of conflicts. Users can use this command to check for conflicts in advance. TODO describe how this will work for patch rollback. h2. Patch Generation Tool * Accepts basic metadata along with the location of a distribution of the new version along with a distribution of the old version* Also includes details on any misc files that are expected to be in active use * Generates a patch.xml file * Can generate a full patch file * Optional: Can be run from inside the bin/ dir of the full distribution of the new version and if provided with the patch.xml file can generate a patch file from the contents of the full dist* Idea here is the patch.xml file could be distributed as part of the new version and the user could use it to generate patch h4.

    <body>+*This doc is in progress and subject to change. ~nickboldt*+ Publishing SOA/BRMS Tooling components *== STEP ONE :: Nightly Snapshot Build (Continuous Integration) ==* Run your job as you would run a local build, that is, by invoking Maven 3 w/ Tycho 0.15 (or later) against your sources. Then publish the output of the build to the server using publish.sh - simply run a shell script at the end of the job which does this: Currently, the publish.sh script that everyone uses assumes a few things: Invocation of the script is done via Jenkins like this:     wget  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/publish/publish.sh http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/publish/publish.sh -q --no-check-certificate -N     . publish.sh *== STEP TWO :: Promoting a Snapshot to Milestone / Release ==* You will need a second job with a "-publish" suffix which will copy your latest nightly to a new location. Invocation of the script is done via Jenkins like this:     wget  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/publish/promote.sh http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/publish/promote.sh -q --no-check-certificate -N     . promote.sh -BUILD_TYPE build_type -TARGET_PLATFORM target_platform -PROJECT_NAME project_name -TARGET_FOLDER target_folder -SOURCE_PATH source_path      https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/jbosstools-promote/ https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/jbosstools-promote/      https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/SOA-Team/view/SOAStudio_6.0.juno/job/SwitchYard-Tools-publish/ https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/SOA-Team/view/SOAStudio_6.0.juno/job/SwitchYard-Tools-publish/      https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/SOA-Team/view/SOAStudio_6.0.juno/job/modeshape-tools-continuous-publish/ https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/SOA-Team/view/SOAStudio_6.0.juno/job/modeshape-tools-continuous-publish/ *== Naming conventions ==* Examples: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/indigo/soa-tooling/switchyard/0.6.0/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/indigo/soa-tooling/switchyard/0.6.0/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/indigo/soa-tooling/modeshape/3.0.0.Beta1/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/indigo/soa-tooling/modeshape/3.0.0.Beta1/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/soa-tooling/modeshape/3.0.0.Beta5/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/soa-tooling/modeshape/3.0.0.Beta5/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/indigo/soa-tooling/switchyard/0.5.0.Final/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/indigo/soa-tooling/switchyard/0.5.0.Final/ *== Integration Builds? ==* In future, we may also have "integration" builds, which are nightlies deemed good enough for use by downstream developers, but not stable enough (ie., not tested enough) to be released to community as a milestone.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single Installation	Patching</header>
    <body>This article outlines design notes for the single instance patching feature being developed for AS 7.2. The 7.2 version of the feature will be apply to apply a patch to a single installation of the AS (i.e. a single unzip of the AS distribution.) That single installation may be being used for a standalone server or for a managed domain Host Controller and servers. However, the 7.2 version will not support coordinated patching by the patching tool of multiple installation in a managed domain. The user can of course independently patch multiple installation in a domain, coordinating the application of those patches themselves. The basic patching process will consist of: 1. The user obtains a patch file. 2. The user uses the CLI tool to connect to a standalone server or Host Controller that is running on the installation that is to be patched.1. The server or Host Controller may be running in admin-only mode or running normally. However, some patches may not be able to be applied if the target process isn't running in admin-only mode 3. The user invokes a command on the CLI providing the location of the patch file. The CLi invokes an operation(s) on the target process telling it to stage the patch. 4. The target process stages the patch by applying the patch contents to the filesystem.1. The changes made to the filesystem during staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before applying the patch. 5. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the staged patch is visible in the runtime. Patches can also be rolled back: 1. The user can use the CLI tool to instruct the target process to revert a patch. 2. Patch reversion results in changes to the filesystem that are staged in the same manner as what is done with a patch installation.1. The changes made to the filesystem during patch rollback staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch rollback with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before rolling back the patch. 3. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the rolled back patch is no longer visible in the runtime. h1. Patch File A patch file is a zip archive that contains a patch.xml file that is used to describe the patch along with the updated modules, OSGi bundles and miscellaneous files that comprise the patch. It's structure is as follows: + patch.xml + modules ++ patch modules in the same structure as they appear the modules dir in the normal AS dist + bundles ++ patch bundles in the same structure as they appear the bundles dir in the normal AS dist + misc ++ misc files that need to be updated, organized in a directory structure that matches the directory structure of the AS dist h3. The patch.xml File The patch.xml file describes the patch. It includes basic information about the patch along with metadata about the modules, bundles and misc files in the patch. h5. Basic patch metadata * The name of the patch * The type of the patch (one-off vs cumulative, etc -- TODO list all) * The version to which the patch applies * A text description of the patch * TODO others h5. Module metadata * The name of the module * The slot of the module * The hash of the module.xml file of the previous version of the module. Not present if the relevant module did not exist in the version being patched. h5. Removed module metadata Identifies modules that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed module * The slot of the removed module h5. Bundle metadata * TODO anything? h5. Removed bundle metadata Identifies bundles that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed bundle h5. Misc file metadata * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file did not exist in the version being patched, or if the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h5. Removed misc file metadata Identifies misc files that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h2. Patch Staging The target process when it applies a patch will create a patches directory directly underneath the root of the AS distribution. As with other directories, the location of this directory can be controlled via a system property passed to the JVM at process launch. Before patch staging begins, a check is made as to whether the target process is in admin-only mode. If it is not, and an unresolvable conflict is detected between a module, bundle or miscellaneous file contained in the patch and a user-modification of the corresponding item in the installation being patched, the patch staging process will be aborted with an error message.  See "Patch Conflict Detection" below. h4. Modules Patch modules will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. Information about the location of this directory will be stored in a location visible to the module loader used by JBoss Modules at boot.  This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the module loader currently in use by the target process. TODO describe check for user-modified modules. Information about removed modules will also be stored in a location visible to the boot module loader at next boot. h4. Bundles Patch bundes will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the OSGi subsystem currently in use by the target process. Information about removed bundles will also be stored in a location visible to the OSGi subsystem at next boot. h4.

A copy of the existing file at that location will be stored in the patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. TODO describe check for user-modified misc files. h4.

However, a copy of all existing configuration files will be made in a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. During patch rollback, these configuration files will be restored. This backup is necessary because once the patch is applied to the runtime, any management operation that results in persistence of the configuration will use the xml schemas associated with the patched version of the core AS and any subsystems.

The patch contents that have been staged are then used by the restarted process. h4. Modules In 7.2 the AS will use a custom implementation of the JBoss Modules ModuleLoader interface, instead of the default implementation used in previous AS 7 releases. The selection of this custom implementation will be part of the launch VM command created by the startup scripts (i.e. standalone.sh/standalone.bat/domain.sh/domain.bat). The module loader works using a notion of a "module path", which is an ordered list of directories in which modules are located. When the module loader needs to find a module, it searches the directories in that path in order, and once it finds the desired module the search ends. Thus, directories earlier in the path listing take precedence over those found later. This is all very similar to how an OS uses the $PATH environment variable. Previous AS7 releases allowed the user to specify a $JBOSS_MODULES_PATH environment variable to declare the "module path", with a default value of $JBOSS_HOME/modules used if not specified. The startup scripts used to the AS pass that module path into JBoss Modules (via the -mp &lt;the_path&gt; argument to java.)  In AS 7.2, the custom module loader we will use will support this behavior, but in addition the custom module loader we provide will be able to examine the patching metadata that will be persisted in the "staging" phase and from that will determine which of the patch-specific subdirectories of the patches directory need to be prepended to the module path. In addition, for modules that have been removed in patches, the custom module loader will know to not load those modules, even though the modules will still remain on the filesystem. h4.

Patch Conflict Detection At the beginning of the patch staging process, a check will be made for conflicts between the patch and any user modifications to the same item. The user when executing the patch command can provide information to guide the tool in resolving conflicts. Any conflicts that cannot be resolved will result in the patch staging being aborted with no changes to the filesystem. Conflict types are: * Modules. If the patch is updating or removing an existing module, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing module's contents. The patching process will hash the current module's contents to check for modifications. If any affected module is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some modules and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to a module, they will need to make an equivalent change to the patch module. The sole purpose of this "module conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Bundles: If the patch is updating or removing an existing bundle, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing bundle's contents. The patching process will hash the current bundle's contents to check for modifications. If any affected bundle is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified bundles is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some bundles and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to a bundle, they will need to make an equivalent change to the patch bundle. The sole purpose of this "bundle conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Misc files: If the patch is updating an existing misc file, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing file. If the patch is removing an existing directory, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing directory's contents. The patching process will hash the current file or directory to check for modifications. If any affected file/directory is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a permission indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. If no permission is available for a particular file or directory, the conflict will be treated as unresolved. These permissions can come in four forms:* A global permission to update all conflicting misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tool's patching command * A global permission to not update any conflicting misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tool's patching command * A file containing* a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is granted. * a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is denied, meaning the existing file should be retained. The patching feature will also include a command that can apply this conflict detection process and provide a report of conflicts. Users can use this command to check for conflicts in advance. TODO describe how this will work for patch rollback. h2. Patch Generation Tool * Accepts basic metadata along with the location of a distribution of the new version along with a distribution of the old version* Also includes details on any misc files that are expected to be in active use * Generates a patch.xml file * Can generate a full patch file * Optional: Can be run from inside the bin/ dir of the full distribution of the new version and if provided with the patch.xml file can generate a patch file from the contents of the full dist* Idea here is the patch.xml file could be distributed as part of the new version and the user could use it to generate patch h4.

    <body>I am trying to integrate ActiveMQ-5.6 with Jboss7.activemq.rar is placed in standalone/deployments folder and I read in many posts that to enable Jboss7 to deploy exploded content you have to create a .dodeploy marker. So I created an empty activemq.rar.dodeploy file and placed it in standalone/deployments folder.But still Jboss7 fails to deploy the rar.If I set auto-deploy-exploded="true" in standalone.xml then Jboss deploys the rar I would like to manually deploy the rar so am wondering what I have missed since just creating the marker file seems to work for others. I still see - 17:07:59,363 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment.scanner] (DeploymentScanner-threads - 1) JBAS015003: Found activemq.rar in deployment directory.

    <body>First of all, next time please use the user section of the forum ( https://community.jboss.org/community/jbossws https://community.jboss.org/en/jbossws), not the dev one. This said, be aware that the code above is making use of JAX-RPC api, is that really what you're trying to do? If that's the case, then you're basically having a service load / classpath issue. Is you client running in-container? If it's not in-container, consider adding the jbossws-native-core-4.0.2.GA.jar from AS 7.1.1.Final in your classpath (that contains the META-INF/services/javax.xml.rpc.ServiceFactory reference you need).</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - local history for the jbpm	web editor</header>
    <body>Hello, We've created a prototype for a local history functionality for the jbpm-designer, we needed it for multiple reasons. It stores data in the browser localStorage, so it also serves a bit like 'undo after save'. It checks the json representation of the process every minute and if it differs, it creates a new local history entry, including a thumbnailed screenshot. It's available after browser restart too, so if you accidentally close the browser, you can still restore your work. Here's a small screenshot. https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bxw7L2kmpno8RkJUY3Zjd0I4Mlk https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bxw7L2kmpno8RkJUY3Zjd0I4Mlk Needs quite much elaboration, but it's already functional and useful for our needs. If you find it interesting, we'd be happy to share it with the community. regards, Gabor Farkas</body>

    <body>Hi community,  I read the comments and threads referred in this link.   Even though I am not clear on everything discusses over there, my understanding is, there is no more PUBLIC patch release for JBoss AS 7.1. tag. Am I correct?  If so, do we need to wait till JBoss 7.2 release? If so, is it going to be public?  Only jboss-naming is failing in my case, is there any way I can integrate Jboss-naming-1.4.Final to Jboss-7.1.1.Final?  Any input would be appreciated.  Thanks for your time and help.</body>

    <body>here is my deployment outline for AS7: JB7.ear --jboss-deployment-structure.xml --JB7EJB.jar --JB7Web.war --JB7Dao.jar I have a question regarding AS7 module class loading. I am trying to use the quartz library and setup a module to do so. I updated the jboss-deployment-structure.xml to look like this after setting up my quartz module &lt;jboss-deployment-structure xmlns="urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.0"&gt;     &lt;ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;true&lt;/ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;     &lt;deployment&gt;         &lt;dependencies&gt;             &lt;module name="org.hibernate" slot="3" /&gt;              &lt;module name="org.quartz" /&gt;         &lt;/dependencies&gt;     &lt;/deployment&gt; &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt; when i deploy and run the app a getthis exception: Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/quartz/SchedulerFactory     at com.lightspeed.ejb.Session1.hello(Session1.java:22) [JB7EJB.jar:]     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) [rt.jar:1.6.0_13]     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) [rt.jar:1.6.0_13]     at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) [rt.jar:1.6.0_13]     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597) [rt.jar:1.6.0_13]     at org.jboss.as.ee.component.ManagedReferenceMethodInterceptorFactory$ManagedReferenceMethodInterceptor.processInvocation(ManagedReferenceMethodInterceptorFactory.java:72) [jboss-as-ee-7.1.1.Final.jar:7.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.invocation.InterceptorContext.proceed(InterceptorContext.java:288) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.invocation.WeavedInterceptor.processInvocation(WeavedInterceptor.java:53) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.as.ee.component.interceptors.UserInterceptorFactory$1.processInvocation(UserInterceptorFactory.java:36) [jboss-as-ee-7.1.1.Final.jar:7.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.invocation.InterceptorContext.proceed(InterceptorContext.java:288) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.as.jpa.interceptor.SBInvocationInterceptor.processInvocation(SBInvocationInterceptor.java:47)     at org.jboss.invocation.InterceptorContext.proceed(InterceptorContext.java:288) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.invocation.InitialInterceptor.processInvocation(InitialInterceptor.java:21) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.invocation.InterceptorContext.proceed(InterceptorContext.java:288) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.invocation.ChainedInterceptor.processInvocation(ChainedInterceptor.java:61) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.as.ee.component.interceptors.ComponentDispatcherInterceptor.processInvocation(ComponentDispatcherInterceptor.java:53) [jboss-as-ee-7.1.1.Final.jar:7.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.invocation.InterceptorContext.proceed(InterceptorContext.java:288) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.pool.PooledInstanceInterceptor.processInvocation(PooledInstanceInterceptor.java:51) [jboss-as-ejb3-7.1.1.Final.jar:7.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.invocation.InterceptorContext.proceed(InterceptorContext.java:288) [jboss-invocation-1.1.1.Final.jar:1.1.1.Final]     at org.jboss.as.ejb3.tx.CMTTxInterceptor.invokeInOurTx(CMTTxInterceptor.java:228) [jboss-as-ejb3-7.1.1.Final.jar:7.1.1.Final]     ... 37 more When i change the  jboss-deployment-structure.xml to look like this, it runs fine: &lt;jboss-deployment-structure xmlns="urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.0"&gt;     &lt;ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;true&lt;/ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;     &lt;deployment&gt;         &lt;dependencies&gt;              &lt;module name="org.hibernate" slot="3" /&gt;         &lt;/dependencies&gt;     &lt;/deployment&gt;     &lt;sub-deployment name="JB7EJB.jar"&gt;         &lt;dependencies&gt;             &lt;module name="org.quartz" /&gt;         &lt;/dependencies&gt;     &lt;/sub-deployment&gt; &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt; I thought that if i put the dependencies under the top 'deployment' section, that all deployments will pick up the quartz module, but i have to add the   '&lt;sub-deployment name="JB7EJB.jar"&gt;' section to have the JB7EJB deloyment pick up the quartz module. What am i missing here? thank you, Bill</body>

    <body>Hi, I have a portal.war wich contains a few jsf pages and one (ManagedBean) Bean annotated @Named, in this war there is a file  WEB-INF/beans.xml, I can reference managed bean in jsf pages throw EL, everything works fine in this application. Now, I have a another.war which depends of portal.war, the file another.war/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains the dependency (Dependencies: deployment.portal.war) and contains too WEB-INF/beans.xml, in this another.war I have a few jsf pages and a few ManagedBeans (Beans annotated @Named), in jsf pages I can reference managed beans which are in another.war throw EL whitout problems, however I want to reference the portal.war managed bean in my another.war jsf pages but I can not. || *portal.war * || * * || *another.war * || * * || | WEB-INF/beans.xml | ok | WEB-INF/beans.xml | ok | | com.test.portal    ...    Dependencies: deployment.portal.war    ... | ok | | | | com.test.another | portalHome.xhtml    ...    ... | ok | anotherHome.xhtml    ...    ... | ok | | | | *anotherHome.xhtml* *   ...* *   ...* | *FAIL* | Two files portal.war and other.war are deployed in jboss 7. I have read cdi documentation, I understand that a library or module wich contains a beans.xml is a "bean archive" and beans which are packaged in a bean archive are available for injection, lookup an EL resolution to classes ans jsf pages packaged in some other bean archive. According to what the documentation says textuallyin the chapter of Modularity +" Beans and their clients may be deployed in modules in a module architecture such as the Java EE environment. In a mod-+ +ule architecture, certain modules are considered bean archives. In the Java EE module architecture, any Java EE module or+ +library is a module. The Java EE module or library is a bean archive if it contains a beans.xml file, as defined in Sec-+ +tion 12.1, “Bean archives”.+ *+A bean packaged in a certain module is available for injection, lookup and EL resolution to classes and JSP/JSF pages+* *+packaged in some other module if and only if the bean class of the bean is required to be accessible to the other module by+* *+the class accessibility requirements of the module architecture. In the Java EE module architecture, a bean class is access-+* *+ible in a module if and only if it is required to be accessible according to the class loading requirements defined by the+* *+Java EE platform specification.+* +Note that, in some Java EE implementations, a bean class might be accessible to some other class even when this is not re-+ +quired by the Java EE platform specification. For the purposes of this specification, a class is not considered accessible to+ +another class unless accessibility is explicitly required by the Java EE platform specification.+ +An alternative is not available for injection, lookup or EL resolution to classes or JSP/JSF pages in a module unless the+ +module is a bean archive and the alternative is explicitly selected in that bean archive. An alternative is never available for+ +injection, lookup or EL resolution in a module that is not a bean archive.++"+ I have found a "solution" for this but I do not believe that is the best way, is for that I want to ask you What I can do for this purpose.

I looked up for details about dependencies for Resources Adapters and found nothing about it in the JBoss 7 Documentations (and google). Inclusive, I saw nothing about deploying resource adapter as a module, what can provides me the resource of dependencies of another module. What is the best way for make my Resource Adapter depends of an module "A" for example ? Put the dependency of "A" in the extension JCA  (org.jboss.as.connector) ? Must I use the RAR Manifest ?

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - EAR jars dependency</header>
    <body>Hello, I have a huge app, many jars are inside of the EAR's folder, at the root I mean. So, I'm getting a lot of missing dependencies errors. The question is: How do I make those jars see each others, and how do I make WAR's jars see those on EAR root? I have over 100 jars and canno't deploy my app, is there a way to turn deployment.earname a global module, that could be found by ANY WAR/JAR?

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: EAR jars	dependency</header>
    <body>Is there any reason why you can't put those jars into ear/lib ? This will make them availble to the whole application. Non ejb-jars (i.e. jars without EJB component defiining annotations or listed as an ejb-jar in application.xml) in the root of the appplication will not be deployed by default (this is per the EE6 platform spec), if you want to leave them where they are you must list them as Class-Path entries in the manifest of any class that wants to use them, which sounds impractical for your case.</body>

    <body>It's easy enough to get maven to generate manifest classpath entries:             &lt;plugin&gt;                 &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;                 &lt;configuration&gt;                     &lt;archive&gt;                         &lt;manifest&gt;                             &lt;addClasspath&gt;true&lt;/addClasspath&gt;                         &lt;/manifest&gt;                     &lt;/archive&gt;                 &lt;/configuration&gt;             &lt;/plugin&gt; but I agree with Stuart. Moving library jars to the EAR/lib directory is much more manageable. Also, the current maven-ear-plugin is pretty good at assembling correct EAR files this way too:            &lt;plugin&gt;                 &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-ear-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;                 &lt;configuration&gt;                     &lt;version&gt;6&lt;/version&gt;                     &lt;generateApplicationXml&gt;true&lt;/generateApplicationXml&gt;                     &lt;defaultLibBundleDir&gt;lib&lt;/defaultLibBundleDir&gt;                     &lt;skinnyWars&gt;true&lt;/skinnyWars&gt;                     &lt;modules&gt;                         &lt;webModule&gt;                             &lt;artifactId&gt;...&lt;/artifactId&gt;                             &lt;contextRoot&gt;...&lt;/contextRoot&gt;                         &lt;/webModule&gt;                         &lt;webModule&gt;                             ...                         &lt;/webModule&gt;                         &lt;ejbModule&gt;                             &lt;artifactId&gt;...&lt;/artifactId&gt;                         &lt;/ejbModule&gt;                     &lt;/modules&gt;                 &lt;/configuration&gt;             &lt;/plugin&gt;</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JBoss 7 domain	deployment</header>
    <body>Hi Everyone, I've been using JBoss 5 for a while and am currently migrating a couple wab apps to JBoss 7.  I have a question about deployment I haven't found an answer to yet.  So to deploy via command line I can do this the first time I deploy: jboss-cli.sh -c command="deploy /path/to/myapp.war –server-groups=my-group" But subsequent deployments give an error that this app is already deployed, so to get a new version of the war deployed I use this command: jboss-cli.sh -c command="deploy -f /path/to/myapp.war" This deploys the new version fine to my server.  But, what is we have a domain setup where there is a server-group/server setup for various developers.  Say developer1-group and developer2-group, where each group has one server.  If developer 1 deploys myapp.war to their group, and developer2 does the same, how does the force option know which group to deploy to?  Or does it deploy to ALL groups that have a myapp.war deployed?  If so, is there a better command to use to accomplish what I've described?  Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

    <body>Hi, best jvm for running AS7 at the moment is still Oracle JDK6, but as Nicklas said it will be EOL soon. Current EOL time is february 2013  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html JDK7 is supported with AS7 but still depends on platform are your running it might not be recommended, for instance currently jdk7 for macosx has few terrible bugs in nio impl that prevents most of communication(remoting) in as7 but can be somewhat workaround. as for what jdk to download, use Java 7/6 SE JDK, other oracle options (EE*) are just extra download with some ee components / tools that are needed to run app server. -- tomaz</body>

And, as in previous releases, it is possible for custom extensions to the AS to be integrated, either by organizations (e.g. other open source projects or ISVs) who want to distribute a modified version of the AS to others, or by organizations who directly run the AS. The means by which AS &amp; can be extended is significantly different than it was in previous releases. This article is intended to discuss those differences, and to elicit thoughts on best practices. The article is focused on educating organizations who want to distribute a modified version of the AS, but hopefully the information herein will be useful to organizations who directly run the AS. h2. How Extending AS 7 is Different from Previous Versions The fundamental difference between AS 7 and previous versions is that in AS 7 +everything isn't a deployment+. In AS 6 and early, the core AS provided some basic functionality including a couple of basic services called +deployers+. Deployers could recognize the existence of content on the filesystem, a.k.a. "deployments", process that content and install new services into AS's core service container. Most of the services provided by the AS itself were themselves +deployments+.  The web container, the EJB container, the transaction manager, the naming service, etc, all were installed as +deployments.+ Even additional deployers, beyond the basic ones that were part of the core AS, were themselves deployments. Those additional deployers could do things like parsing a web.xml, making it possible to deploy additional kinds of deployments (e.g. a war file), but they themselves were deployments. And, of course, end user applications like Java EE ears and war, were also deployments. So, in this architecture, end user applications were logically equivalent to the web container, the EJB container -- all extended the core capabilities of the AS and all were +deployments.+ In AS 7, the basic design philosophy is that deployments are end user applications. Adding new fundamental capabilities to the application server is done by installing +extensions+. However, since deployments and extensions in the end add new capabilities to the core server, what are the differences between the two? Why would someone wishing to extend the AS choose one or the other? h2. Extensions and Subsystems An +extension+ is an implementation of the org.jboss.as.controller.Extension interface, packaged in a directory structure accessible to the JBoss Modules modular classloading layer used by the AS. An extension can register one or more +subsystems+ with the core AS. A subsystem is a set of functionality; e.g. the web container is a subsystem. See the  https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Extending+JBoss+AS+7 Extending JBoss AS 7 documentation for more details on how to write an extension. Extensions are packaged as JBoss Modules modules. Typically you would place your extension's module(s) in the $JBOSS_HOME/modules directory. (You can place your modules in another location if before running standalone.sh or domain.sh you set the $JBOSS_MODULE_PATH environment variable to a value that includes both your location and the location of the $JBOSS_HOME/modules directory.) Why would you use an extension to add functionality to the AS? * You want to make aspects of your new functionality manageable by your end users, e.g. via the AS's CLI tool and via the standalone.xml and domain.xml configuration files. The Extension interface is the means by which the core AS is told about the management API exposed by your new functionality, and about the xml parsing and marshalling logic used to read and write its configuration. One of the main new features in AS 7 is a consistent management solution; if you want your functionality to properly integrate with these management features you need to use an extension. * You want to be able to process deployments. AS 7 has "deployment unit processors" which are conceptually similar to "deployers" in early releases. They are invoked during deployment and undeployment of deployments and can perform processing work on the deployment. Only extensions can register deployment unit processors with the core AS. * Patching. We will introduce a patching tool in later releases of AS 7. Extensions will have significant advantages over deployments when it comes to patching. See the section on this below. * You wish to differente your extension from end user applications. End users will typically use deployments to extend the AS's functionality (e.g. deploying a WAR deployment adds new functionality). Using deployments instead of extensions for things other than end-user applications mixes end user stuff with non-end-user stuff, somewhat muddying the waters. In particular:* The actual physical binaries may be mixed. If instead of using an extension you put a deployment in standalone/deployments, now your binaries will be mixed with end user binaries. To avoid this, you either need to configure a separate deployment scanner to deploy your content from a different location, or require some sort of installation process (e.g. execution of a CLI script) to get your deployment installed. The "configure a separate deployment scanner" approach is only available for standalone servers, since deployment scanners are not supported in a managed domain. * Your deployments will be mixed with the end user deployments in the management resource tree. For example if an admin starts the CLI and executes ls deployment they will see your deployments in the same list as their own. Same thing with the admin console. h2. Deployments A deployment in AS7 is binary content that is installed into the server via a mangement client (or a deployment scanner, which is really just an automated management client.) The management client either uploads the content to the server or informs it of its filesystem location, and then asks the server to install that content. The server does so by taking the deployment's bits and making them available to the various deployment unit processors (DUPs) that have been added by the server's extensions. The DUPs examine the contents of the deployments and take the necessary actions to start the necessary services for the deployment and integrate them with the needed container services. Why would you use a deployment to add functionality to the AS? * You're an end user installing an EE application. * You're an end user adding new mbean services or JBoss MSC services and you are not concerned with making you new functionality manageable via the AS's CLI tool or via the standalone.xml and domain.xml configuration files. You could use an extension for your new functionality instead of a deployment, but many users will find using a deployment easier, particularly if they are porting something from a previous AS release. * You're not an end user, but your new functionality requires complex integration with the AS's EE containers. The deployment unit processors that handle deployments take care of that integration for you. h2. A Mixed Approach It is possible to mix extensions and deployments. For example, if you wanted to expose aspects of your new functionality's configuration to admins via the AS's management APIs, but also need to accept end user requests via the servlet container, you could package a war inside your extension's module and then have the "add" operation handler for your subsystem deploy the war. See  https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/commit/197f7b64b48f4a28a7d44be4820d0941179d7dba https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/commit/197f7b64b48f4a28a7d44be4820d0941179d7dba for a prototype extension with a subsystem that deploys an ear when it is added to the server. This approach still suffers from the drawback that your extension's war will appear alongside end-user applications in the management resource tree. h2. Implications for Patching In a future AS 7 release we will be introducing a patching feature, with a tool that stage a patch in an AS 7 installation and then (optionally) restart the standalone server of Host Controller + servers running on that installation. The feature will include the ability to roll back patches. This feature has implications for the decision about whether to add functionality to the AS via extensions or deployments. Extensions are packaged as JBoss Modules modules, typically located in the $JBOSS_HOME/modules directory. It will be quite simple for the patching tool support staging/installation/rollback of modules. When the AS launches, it is provided with a "modules path", a list of filesystem locations under which modules can be found. This "modules path" is conceptually very similar to an OS $PATH environment variable. It's an ordered list of locations; when the AS needs to locate a module for the first time it iterates through that list of locations checking each for the desired module; once found the search stops. This behavior makes it simple to apply staging/install/rollback behavior to modules by storing the patch's modules in a new directory location specific to the patch and then manipulating the "modules path" used by the AS. The upshot of all this is functionality added to the AS via an extension will be easily patchable. The patching tool will also be able to patch arbitrary non-module files located in the AS installation (e.g. the bin/standalone.sh script). It will do this by storing a copy of the original file in a private working area, and then replacing the file with the patched one. Rollback of the patch means restoring the original file by copying it back from the private working area. This works fine, +unless the server is actively using the original file+. If the server is actively using the original file, the patch cannot be +staged+. As soon as the patch tool lays down the new file, it will be visible to the running server. An example of the kind of problem this can cause is if your added functionality was packaged as a deployment located in standalone/deployments. If you create a patch file with a new version of your deployment and ask your users to use the patching tool to install it, the tool will put a new version of the file in standalone/deployments -- and the deployment scanner will see that new version and tell the patching tool to deploy it.</body>

    <body>Hello, We have a need to invoke remote EJB calls against multiple servers. The invoker is a scheduling engine and the targets are client specific instances. We configure an EJB Client Selector per remote host. Looking closely at EJBClientContext.setSelector(selector), this method is using a static variable called (SELECTOR) and not a thread local. i.e You can not use this from multiple threads simultaneously without turning the invoker into a single threaded process. Undersirable for the use case at hand. Is there any workaround for this? Thank you for all your help in this.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Web Development] - Chunked encoded	content by HTTPS problem</header>
    <body>Hi all! I have the next issue. I have a project deployed on Jboss 5.1 server. My server is communicates with clients by SOAP messages. Entry point is HttpServlet. Also there is two types of authantication: BASIC and DIGEST, also some clients can communicate without auth. When server is working on 8443 port with HTTPS and BASIC or DIGEST authantication I have the next problem only with clients which sends content in chunked transfer-encoding: 1. Client sends first SOAP message to initiate new session 2. Server responds with 401 Unathorized status code because there absent WWW-Authenticate header 3. Client sends the next message with WWW-Authenticate header conaining credentials 4. Server sends response with 200 OK status code 5. Client doesn't sends anything, but must If auth is switched off all is OK on p.5 server recieves right message from client. Also if communication is on port 8080 HTTP all is OK, message from client is present on p.5. Also if I work with "non-chunked" clients all is ok. So problem is only in complex of the next items: https, chunked transfer encoding, BASIC or DIGEST auth After hours of researching I had found the next: 1. if Jboss uses JSSE standart connector in jbossweb server.xml the problem is present, 2. but if I switched on the Tomcat APR connector the problem is desappears. 3. Also the problem is not present on Jboss 4.2.3 (on JSSE) - this is the most strange thing in this issue 4. I had decoded ssl packets in Wireshark tcp sniffer and saw strange thing: in Jboss 5 while recieving of p.3, server sends to client one packet, which marked in sniffer by Malformed packet. I Jboss 4.2.3 it is absent On production I can not use APR connector (it is customers requirement). Can anybody explain me: 1. What is the diffrence in HTTPS connector implementation between Jboss 4.2.3 and 5.1? 2. What is the diffrence in processing of chunked encoded packets between 4.2.3 and 5.1? P.S.: also I had tried to update/downgrade jbossweb.jar and jbossweb-deployers.jar Big thanks for any help, I have already spent on this two weeks  :(</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JBoss AS 7.1.0 not working with OCI driver</header>
    <body>Hi,   I have Jboss AS 4.05 currently and am migrating to JBoss AS 7.1.0. I installed Jboss7.1.0 and did the setup and everything works fine except the jdbc driver. I have downloaded the instantclient from oracle website for oralce 11g (1.2.0.1.0)  in C:\ple\instantclient folder which has the ojdbc6.jar and ocijdbc11.dll and other dlls . My oracle database is in a different machine and its the same version(11.2.0.1.0.)  I created a simple java program which does these things and it works fine and returns the results without any error. But when i do the exact same thing from a jsp inside the Jboss 7.1.0 server it doesnt work and gives a sql exception in DriverManager.getConnection() with no trace or detail message. All the detailed message the SQLException had was some 4 wierd square shaped characters and those characters keeps changing too everytime i run it. This same thing works fine with my Jboss 4.05 server with the oci driver. The other thing i noticed was if i changed the driver to thin in my connectString (jdbc:oracle:thin:@sridb:1521:intpl) it works fine. *Has anyone encountered this similar issue. Any help in this is appreciated.* In my jboss standalone.bat i set the classpath and path as set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;C:\ple\instantclient\ojdbc6.jar set PATH=C:\ple\instantclient;%PATH% In modules folder i created com/myoracle/main folders and copied into it the C:\ple\instantclient\ojdbc6.jar also created a dlls folder under main and copied all the dlls from C:\ple\instantclient This is how my module.xml looks like &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.0" name="com.myoracle"&gt;     &lt;resources&gt;       &lt;resource-root path="dlls"/&gt;         &lt;resource-root path="ojdbc6.jar"/&gt;     &lt;/resources&gt;     &lt;dependencies&gt;         &lt;module name="javax.api"/&gt;         &lt;module name="javax.transaction.api"/&gt;     &lt;/dependencies&gt; &lt;/module&gt; In my test.war/WEB-INF this is my jboss-deployment-structure.xml &lt;jboss-deployment-structure&gt;     &lt;deployment&gt;         &lt;!-- Exclusions allow you to prevent the server from automatically adding some dependencies --&gt;         &lt;exclusions&gt;         &lt;/exclusions&gt;            &lt;dependencies&gt;                                 &lt;module name="com.myoracle" /&gt;                     &lt;/dependencies&gt;      &lt;/deployment&gt; &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt; I also tried it with giving a datasource in standalone.xml l and accessing it in my jsp with the datasource name. But get the same issue. It works only if i use thin but not oci. &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:1.0"&gt;             &lt;datasources&gt;                 &lt;datasource jta="true" jndi-name="java:/OracleDS" pool-name="OracleDS" enabled="true" use-java-context="true"&gt;                     &lt;connection-url&gt;jdbc:oracle:oci:@sdqa11:1521:intpl&lt;/connection-url&gt;                     &lt;driver&gt;plejdbc&lt;/driver&gt;                     &lt;security&gt;                         &lt;user-name&gt;nielsen_claritas&lt;/user-name&gt;                         &lt;password&gt;f00sball&lt;/password&gt;                     &lt;/security&gt;                 &lt;/datasource&gt;                 &lt;drivers&gt;                     &lt;driver name="plejdbc" module="com.nielsen.oraclejdbc"&gt;                         &lt;xa-datasource-class&gt;oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource&lt;/xa-datasource-class&gt;                     &lt;/driver&gt;                 &lt;/drivers&gt;             &lt;/datasources&gt;         &lt;/subsystem&gt;</body>

It is not an IT admin, it is more the Service Manager. So we build a kind of eclipse rcp app that consumes a dsl to generate XACML and distributes it on a set of preconfigured pdps... May be requirements analysis helps us to understand, why the standard is still not widely used. -&gt;cb</body>

    <body>In the XACML impl I worked on it the thought had been that the policy modeller would be part of the info security team, even in a PAP this takes some specialized skill.  However without a PAP it fell to developers to craft the XML policies.  There was also a need to delegate control over some of the details to a variety of different people (business users, customer power users).  They wouldn't write policies per say but have control over some of the "constraints" defined by the policies and the UI would be simplified greatly to where it needed little to no training/additional skill.   I like your thinking on the DSL.. that idea had been bouncing around in my head as well.   Although, I was thinking it could directly drive the PDP... I see the value in XACML being the data and logical model and not so much in the fact that it uses XML.  That is to say I don't see any particular value in generating XML other than the fact that the current PDP drives off of it.  Many of the COTS drive off a database representation of the entities.   Also, I think a DSL may be a good interim step in creating a usable PAP, but that ultimately it needs a UI on top of it for easiest learning curve.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - Re: Get something started with XACML - Requirements Discussion</header>
    <body>the policy modeller as part of the info security team- interesting point. I thought the possible advantage of XACML -besides from interop- is the ability to change and adapt existing access rules while the system is running, i.e. is already developed. So if we restrict the ability to change the rules to specialized people, it tends to get adjusted one time or twice in the lifecycle of the software. It is not much different from hardcoding the rules in the software. If we really want to use the advantage, we need to enable the business guys to understand what happens. But I haven't seen such a system working. So as you describe it - this organization has some procedure to work with "meta-rules" and then they give the order to change to the security team. The question is, how often occur changes ? But even if you have specialized people- the policysets get big and complex and so the GUI should really be able to structure them according to different perspectives (like eclipse perspectives) There might be an application perspective, an organization perspective, a dictionary. It is a special kind of rule management system. There have been various attempts to write good editors, see  http://www.tfgordon.de/publications http://www.tfgordon.de/publications. But it is worth a try.</body>

    <body>Excuse me for misstating the real issue. We do not care about the JNDI lookup not being hardcoded with  security details. We want the freedom to invoke the EJB using the ClientLoginModule. It looks like Sasl Client setup does not take the credentials as set by ClientLoginModule into account. Is this supported? This worked just fine in 4.x and 6.x. I saw remote.connection.default.callback.handler.class property but could not find a CallBackHandler to  simply read what was setup by ClientLoginModule. I must be missing something.            jndiProps.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, "password");                                 EJBClientContext.setSelector(selector);                                            Service service = (Service) ctx.lookup("XXX"); // No issues here            // Local login as another user. Hoping that SASL will somehow pick these            // credentials up before invocation            // Client login module gets called and sets up the            // the correct principal in SecurityAssociationActions.            // Fails witht he dreaded "No EJB receiver available" but the real exception is a security            // Exception.

  <mail>
    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: ClientLoginModule	support</header>
    <body>Tarek, at the moment the credentials are used to establish the connection and can not be changed for this. Also the connection is handled transparent (if you do not use the EjbClient API direct and handle it), it will be closed by GC (finalizer) if you remove all references. The ejb-client (and the server) is optimized for such connections, instead of using multiple connections (AS4/5) only one connection is used and the requests go through the same connection. Therefor the authentication and behaviour (e.g. threading) are different. There is a possiblility to have more than one connection and select the connection/user from the app-code, I can provide an example if needed.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: ClientLoginModule	support</header>
    <body>Hi Wolf, I would appreciate the example. This is a major rewrite in our application of what has been working for the past 8 years. A bit troublesome is that EJB authentication on the server side does work with the ClientLoginModule.  With 7.x, there is now a big difference on how local vs remote ejb's are invoked. In local mode, security context can be propogated using ClientLoginModule. Unlike remote calls. EJB invocations should be consistent and they now feel worlds apart. While all the optimizations in the remoting layer are appreciated, taking away thread-set-credentials in remote calls will undeniably cause a lot of headaches for developers. Just my 2 cents.

The military alliance has yet to confirm that the gunman behind Thursday's attack was an actual member of the Afghan forces, and not just a militant who had acquired a uniform to get nearer his targets.

    <body>*Dear All, I had to do this for my project. If any one of you have this requirement then you can use it. Environment Details :- Consumer on HTTPs with client auth enabled web server (apache or can be anything) app server (Jboss ESB +++++) [I was using SOA-P 5.2] Issue :- httpgateway (basically a listener) can't get client cert to authenticate the details of the customer. Descritption, short coming and Solution :- Basically problem lies in the layer where HTTP request with all it's header is passed to the action chain in the service where typicaly your gatewaty is httpgateway.   &lt;http-gateway name=++"HTTP-Gateway".....++ Internally it uses few classes. Of particular interest to us are two classes which is used and needs to be customized to meet the need. org.jboss.soa.esb.listeners.gateway.http.HttpMessageComposer ﻿ org.jboss.soa.esb.listeners.gateway.http.HttpRequestWrapper ﻿ ﻿* Changes that you will need to are following :- [1] Instruct ESB service to use your custom message composer class [2] Create a custom message composer class [3] Create a custom HttpRequestWraper class which can handle attributes, http headers and locales (what ever you need is, not necessary to handle everything) Steps in details [1] Instruct ESB service to use your custom message composer class Modify your jboss-esb.xml file and add below statement as part of &lt;http-gateway&gt; tag &lt;property name="composer-class" value="esb.gateway.CustomHttpMessageComposer"/&gt; This tell the service to use the customized HttpMessageComposer [2] Create a custom message composer class     @Override /* * this is the only method you need to override. * make it return your custom httprequest class which can handle attributes and headers and locale * retain all the original functionality by calling the super class method */                 //Copy the attributes. This will have cert info     //Copy Headers     //Copy Locale [3] Create a custom HttpRequestWraper class //Locales implementation hasn't been tested including getter and setter for locales /* * In the costructor get all the values by making call to the super class * Add getter and setter method for nea features you want * Here methods have been added to handle attribute(cleint cert comes in this), http header and locale */ This is all that's required for this. Finally note that you need to get and use customHttpRequest you have created in your custom action where you want to inspect the client cert(or. anything you customized).   CustomHttpRequest req = (CustomHttpRequest)message.getProperties().getProperty( "org.jboss.soa.esb.http.HttpRequest#request" Good Luck !!!

Aerogear 3. JBoss Developer Framework/JBossWay 4. RESTEasy 5. GateIN 6. DeltaSpike 7. ModeShape 8. Teiid h2. Requirements (In Progress) 1. Need simpler application security programming model. 2. Need better control over authentication mechanism. 3. Need security detached from the containers. 4. Need an Identity Management Model. (Represent Users/Roles/Groups/Attributes with databases/ldap). 5. Need Challenge/Response based authentication model. 6. Need fine grained authorization and permission model. 7. Need support for SAML2, OAuth2, JOSE. Special requirements from DML: *  Authorization framework that is compatible with the EJB security model and also integrates with EE 7 security manager requirements and AccessControlContext * Possible alternative to AccessControlContext for performance-sensitive applications * Long term, a possibly fine-grained authorization framework for server and domain management * Consolidated secure materials management (key management, certificate management, trust management) * Alternative authentication mechanisms (e.g. private key authentication, maybe revisit SRP) for web and SASL (in addition to supporting existing mechanisms such as so-called "silent" auth) * Support alternative identity/principal types (e.g. public keys, certificates) in addition to user name * Support multiple identity realms based on selection criteria (realm if supported, or other criteria such as source IP address, chosen auth mechanism, or other principal like client cert) h2.

    <body>It worked after i changed the ejb-jar.xml to use the ejb-jar_2_1.xsd instead of the ejb-jar_2_0.dtd.  But this is strange, because the jboss does not check the ejb-jar.xml against the schema which is specified directly in the file - it seems that the check is always done against the ejb-jar_2_1.xsd.</body>

    <body>Hi, I'm trying to migrate an application from JBoss 5.1.0 GA to Jboss AS 7.1.1. The old application used the JBoss specific +Message Driven POJOs.+ http://docs.jboss.org/ejb3/docs/tutorial/1.0.7/html/Consumer_and_Producer.html http://docs.jboss.org/ejb3/docs/tutorial/1.0.7/html/Consumer_and_Producer.html Up to now I have not found any corresponding classes and annotations  (e.g. *org.jboss.ejb3.annotation.Producer*, *org.jboss.ejb3.annotation.Consumer*) within the JBoss 7 modules.

    <body>For JBoss7 xa-datasource,I was getting the warning messages "[com.arjuna.ats.jta] (Periodic Recovery) ARJUNA016027: LocalXARecoveryModule.xaRecovery got XA exception XAException.XAER_RMERR: javax.transaction.xa.XAException". This was occuring even when no transactions were being run. As explained in the forum posts, I gave the required DB privileges to the db user (SELECT privilage for sys.dba_pending_transactions etc.) This fixed the warning messages. Before granting these privileges in production environments, I wanted to check if this is just a warning message that can be ignored. For previous JBoss version (5.1.0 GA) we did not get this warning message. Please let me know if this should be considered as warning or error?  (The message says WARN, still would like to confirm) Thanks, Binu</body>

    <body>There isn't really a master/slave distinction in AS7, except for usage of SingletonService.  You could, given some channel, indicate which node is the cluster coordinator.  The easiest way to do this is via Infinispan. e.g. @Resource(lookup = "java:jboss/infinispan/container/some-container-name") As for determining whether the node is running in standalone or domain mode, I'm not entirely sure.  Try asking on the main AS7 user forum.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Bom's dependencies not picked up when running test phase in maven</header>
    <body>Hi there, I have been trying for quite some time now to get jms to work after migrating from as5 to as7. After looking up at the as7 quickstarts (helloworld-jms) i managed to make it work. The fact that i was based on the quickstarts means that i added the bom in my project's pom as well. The bom looks llike that: &lt;dependency&gt;                               &lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.as&lt;/groupId&gt;                               &lt;artifactId&gt;jboss-as-jms-client-bom&lt;/artifactId&gt;                               &lt;version&gt;7.1.1.Final&lt;/version&gt;                               &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; Everything works fine and my project can build and run with no problem at, but I recently started running the fest GUI tests that I have written and i get a ClassNotFoundException in org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory. I know that this comes from the quickstart's bom which means that during maven's test phase it doesnt get picked up in order to provide me with the classes that are needed. I (think) i confirmed this by adding jbossall-client as a dependency and that works fine with the tests. I also tried adding &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt; in the bom and it doesnt seem to work either. Any ideas? thanks D.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - apache commons.io dependency problem in jbpm-console-server</header>
    <body>The org.apache.batik.pdf_1.6.0.v201105071520.jar included with the birt report-engine integration appears to include an old version of the classes from commons.io. As I understand it,to install the report engine, the libraries from reportEngine/lib, including the batik.pdf jar should be copied to WEB-INF/lib, which I have done. In the jbpm-gwt-shared project the GuvnorConnectionUtils.getProcessSourceContent() method is throwing a NoSuchMethodError at line 212, which is not being caught or logged. The cause is that method org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.copy(InputStream, Writer) does not exist. This method was introduced in version 1.1 of commons.io. Removing the org.apache.batik.pdf_1.6.0.v201105071520.jar, allows the classes in commons.io.1.4.jar to become visible and solves the problem. I am not familiar with the jboss Modules system. Is there some configuration which can hide these offending classes from other libraries within the same deployment? I can submit a patch which replaces the catch block at line 214 of GuvnorConnectionUtils to catch a Throwable, so at least the problem is logged if it affects anyone else. Am I doing somethng daft or missing another obvious solution? Any pointers to solutions will be much appreciated. I have asked a question about the inclusion of the commons.io classes in the batik.pdf jar on the eclipse Birt forum.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Logging with	slf4j in 7.1.0.Final</header>
    <body>Thanks for the response David. We are kind of stuck until an open source version that allows application logging is available. We have since went forward and are using the standalone.xml configuration. We've run into what I believe is a limitation. We have a couple of applications that both share a common jar file. It would be useful for us to be able to direct the logging output to the appropriate application. I've not been able to determine how to do it using handlers and categories. I've create 2 size-rotating-file-handlers, one for each application. For the categories that are specific to the each application, Ive created a category that directs to the appropriate handler. Since each application includes the jar file, there doesnt appear to be a way to direct the common jars log output based on the application it is being called from. Example:             &lt;size-rotating-file-handler name="app1"&gt;                 &lt;level name="INFO"/&gt;                 &lt;formatter&gt;                 &lt;/formatter&gt;                 &lt;file relative-to="jboss.server.log.dir" path="app1.log"/&gt;                 &lt;rotate-size value="100K"/&gt;                 &lt;append value="false"/&gt;             &lt;/size-rotating-file-handler&gt;             &lt;size-rotating-file-handler name="app2"&gt;                 &lt;level name="INFO"/&gt;                 &lt;formatter&gt;                 &lt;/formatter&gt;                 &lt;file relative-to="jboss.server.log.dir" path="app2.log"/&gt;                 &lt;rotate-size value="100K"/&gt;                 &lt;append value="false"/&gt;             &lt;/size-rotating-file-handler&gt;             &lt;logger category="app1.package" use-parent-handlers="false"&gt;                 &lt;handlers&gt;                     &lt;handler name="app1"/&gt;                 &lt;/handlers&gt;             &lt;/logger&gt;             &lt;logger category="app2.package" use-parent-handlers="false"&gt;                 &lt;handlers&gt;                     &lt;handler name="app2"/&gt;                 &lt;/handlers&gt;             &lt;/logger&gt;             &lt;logger category="common" use-parent-handlers="false"&gt;                 &lt;handlers&gt;                     ?????                 &lt;/handlers&gt;             &lt;/logger&gt;</body>

There is a JIRA that would support logging profiles,  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4057 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4057, that would work for you though.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - JBoss AS7: Enabling JASPI Authentication for Web Applications</header>
    <body>Hi guys, I think jaspic's support of configuration mechanism pluggability has had the unfortunate consequence (from the perspective of developers who use different products) of allowing vendors to focus on integrating authentication mechanism configuration in their proprietary configuration consoles and systems. We need to also cooperate ro make sure that developers and system admins have access to and are able to integrate and use a portable vendor independent authentication mechanism configuration system. One such system is included in the Glassfish open source project (search JAASServletAuthConfigProvider.java). It should be possible for this AuthConfigProvider to be registered in any Servlet Container Profile of JASPIC compatible servlet container, whcih will then allow the developer/security admin to configure authentication modules using JAAS config-file syntax. To make things really simple, the AuthConfigProvider can be registered via a ServletContainerInitializer, or via the persistent configuration of the vendor supplied AuthConfigFactory. Since the Factory is also pluggable via the spi, it should alos be possible to replace a vendor provided AuthConfigFactory with a portable AuthConfigFactory. One such factory, AuthConfigFileFactory.java may be found in Glassfish. Use of a common factory, would then allow simple common persistent configuration of the JAASServletAuthConfigProvider, and of any other AuthConfigProviders that should be available in the vendor environment. If you are interested in the use of JASPIC within Servlet, you should consider tracking or participating in the open source project Nobis (i.e the RI of JSR 351) where we are working to facilitate portable authentication mechanims pluggability in the context of a standard AttributeService and representation of Identity Atrributes. We have already begun the process of creating some portable ServerAuthModuels (Facebook Connect, and SAML Web SSO) and are working to failitate portable configuration (as described above) see  http://java.net/projects/nobis/pages/Home http://java.net/projects/nobis/pages/Home and  http://java.net/projects/nobis/sources/git/show/Nobis/authentication http://java.net/projects/nobis/sources/git/show/Nobis/authentication. Ron ps: we are reviewing the portability and packaging of the glassfish systems mentioned above as part of the Nobis project. If you see any problems please feel free to create an issue in the Nobis issue tracker.   </body>

    <body>Designer currently supports strictly what the jBPM runtime currently supports. As we add things to the runtime, we also add it to Designer. We could support the entire BPMN2 spec however it's a trade-off because we focus on being able to create executable business processes in the jBPM 5 runtime. Looking at your bpmn2, Designer would not understand the collaborations and multiple process elements (pools) as the runtime does not support that yet. Hope this helps.</body>

    <body>Hi Anil, that's good news, and please understand that I did not mean to imply anything negative about the existing JBOSS JASCPIC configuration methodology. We will be contributing the portable JAAS AuthConfigProvider and ConfigFile based AuthConfigFactory into Nobis. They are both based on a framework, which should facilitate development of other similarly portable AuthConfigProviders. Also, the use cases being discussed in Nobis, may be of interest to readers of this thread. If so, they can look at the Nobis wiki to find src and teleconference details.</body>

Build/Deploy To deploy jbossws-native you run:    cd jbossws-native    ant deploy-jboss501 When jboss starts you should see something like 09:32:09,581 INFO  [ServerImpl] Starting JBoss (Microcontainer)... 09:32:09,583 INFO  [ServerImpl] Release ID: JBoss [Morpheus] 5.0.0.CR1 (build: SVNTag=JBoss_5_0_0_CR1 date=200805051004) ... 09:33:24,587 INFO  [NativeServerConfig] JBoss Web Services - Stack Native Core 09:33:24,588 INFO  [NativeServerConfig] 3.0.2-SNAPSHOT ... 09:33:32,318 INFO  [AjpProtocol] Starting Coyote AJP/1.3 on ajp-127.0.0.1-8009 09:33:32,341 INFO  [ServerImpl] JBoss (Microcontainer) [5.0.0.CR1 (build: SVNTag=JBoss_5_0_0_CR1 date=200805051004)] Started in 1m:22s:744ms h3. Run the smoke tests    cd jbossws-native    mvn -Psmoketest,jboss501 test You should expect to see no test failures.  There might be a number of FIXME messages on the console. These are linked to open JIRA issues. Starting from JBossWS 4, the integration testsuites have been moved to 'integration-test' maven phase.

    <body>To put it in other words, we +aren't+ coming up with a new protocol for transaction management but instead are just implementing it. I can see that there might be some mis-understanding about the "EJB client API which was introduced in AS7 uses its own protocol for remote transaction propagation between the client and the server for EJB invocations." sentence in this article. The "protocol" being referred there isn't about transactions. What it really means is a "wire format" of the binary stream of data that gets passed between the servers during EJB invocations.</body>

    <body>Hi, In the documentation there is a paragraph about how to create a process programmatically using the Fluent Process API and then pass it into the KnowledgeBuilder as parameter in order to the session to start a process instance for it... What i want is the opposite operation : reading a process definition programmatically node by node, whether to read it directly from the ".bpmn" file by indicating it s path or to get it from the jbpm/droos object that contains its instance (i dont know neither which is that object (the ksession ? the processInstance ?)  nor what should i exactly get from that object :is it a RuleFlowProcess ? a WorkflowProcess ? i was about to read a process definition .bpmn file using xml parsing  and extract all informations i want which is not the appropriate way to do that. Please , i need any example or even some advices for this issue. Thanks. h2. h2. . h2.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Re: How to read a process definition in jbpm 5.4?</header>
    <body>not sure what you try to do. Do you want to get get process definition represented with objects? If you you can get it from KnowledgeBase once it's built. from kbase you can get all available processes and by iterating over it you can find one that interests you. Once you have it you can get Node objects out of Process and thus gathering all required information. HTH P.S. better is to place user questions on user forum (parent to this one) and this was used mainly by development team but it is not any more so no too much attention here.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Bridging	WS-BA to JTA</header>
    <body>This is a design descusion for how to implement  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1099 [JBTM-1099] Consider the following, common, use case for WS-BA: A WS-BA enabled service offers an operation for doing some work. For example, making a booking or purchasing an item. When this operation is invoked a new order is committed to the database. If the business activity is later canceled, the compensate operation is invoked on the service. This compensation action will take the necessary steps to undo the work and will likely make changes to the database content. For example by deleting the order or marking it as canceled. Alternatively, if the activity is successful the 'close' operation will be invoked on the service as a confirmation. It's also possible that the service may make an update to the database here, to mark the order as confirmed. Two of the key benefits of using WS-BA in this scenario are that; i) no locks are held between the doWork and close/compensate phases, and ii) the service is guaranteed to receive the outcome of the activity even in the presence of failures. If the service wants to update the database within a transaction, they have these options (that I can currently come up with, there may be others): h4. Manage a single subordinate JTA transaction (Poor choice) Here the service would begin a subordinate JTA transaction in the 'doWork' method, prepare it during 'confirmCompleted', and then commit it during the 'close' or rollback during the 'compensate'. Essentially the application is mapping the WS-BA lifecycle onto a 2PC ACID lifecycle. The main problems with this approach are that: 1. Locks are held between the two phases of the protocol. Violates i) from above. 2. It's tricky/error-prone for the developer as they need to manage a subordinate transaction. 3. There are failure windows which violate ii) from above. h4. Use multiple JTA transactions  (Better choice, but not perfect) Here the application begins a transaction at the start of the doWork method and commits it just before the method returns. A separate JTA transaction is begun at the start of the close/compensate method and committed just before it returns. This approach is more likely to be used than the previous as it can be achieved with just JPA and transactional annotations. On the surface it looks like it should just work. However I think it is susceptible to a failure window: h6. Failure window in first phase Consider the following scenario: 1. Client begins a BA 2. Client invokes service 3. Service begins a JTA transaction 4. Service updates the DB 5. Service commits the JTA 6. Service crashes 7. Service resumes and does nothing as the BA did not progress far enough to produce a log 8. Client receives a failure from the service invocation and either cancels the BA or attempts to close it; which the coordinator will fail as the participant did not complete. Here the BA was unsuccessful, but the JTA transaction committed. We have an inconsistent state. h6. No failure window in the second phase I don't think failure windows exists for the close or compensate methods. This is because these methods are invoked after a log has been written and so survive failure. They are also invoked periodically until the coordinator receives an acknowledgement. For this to work, the application logic needs to tolerate retries; which is the case for plain WS-BA anyway. Consider this example: 1. Coordinator sends 1st compensate message 2. Compensate invoked for 1st time (C1) 3. C1 begins JTA1 4. C1 reads from the DB to check not compensated (Obtains a read lock) 5. C1 discovers that not yet compensated so writes the change to the DB to do the compensate (Obtains write lock) 6. Coordinator sends 2nd compensate message as it has not recived the ack to the firs tin a timely manor 7. Compensate is invoked for the 2nd time (C2) 8. C2 begins JTA2 9. C2 reads form DB to check not compensated (Waits to obtain the read lock) 10. C1 commits JTA1 11. First compensate message is acked 12. C2 now obtains the read lock on the data and discovers that already compensated 13. C2 commits JTA2 14. Second compensate message is acked. Providing the same transaction is used to do both; i) detect compensation, and ii) compensate; I believe we are safe. h5. Potential Solution In this solution we configure an interceptor on the service request that automatically enlists a participant in the incoming WS-BA activity and maps the events onto calls to a subordinate JTA transaction. This is a similar approach to that used for WS-AT to JTA mapping. This is the mapping that I propose: || *WS-BA * || *JTA * || | Application request arrives | Begin subordinate JTA1 | | completed | Prepare  JTA1 (ensures that we can later complete. Notify 'cannotComplete' if JTA1 fails to prepare) | | confirmCompleted | Commit  JTA1 | | close  arrives | begin  JTA2 and asociate with thread that calls 'close' on the WS-BA participant | | closed leaves | commit JTA2. Failure here will cause the 'close'to be retried. | | compensate arrives | begin  JTA2 and asociate with thread that calls 'compensate' on the WS-BA participant | | compensated leaves | commit JTA2. Failure here will cause the compensate to retry. | The crux of the solution is: 1. Don't commit JTA1 until the transaction log has been written. Do this by delaying the commit until the confirmCompleted event is raised. 2. 'Surround' the calls to the close and compensate invocations on the WS-BA participant with JTA2. I don't think this can be done through the XTS API, so would require some internal changes. h4. Feedback Please! Feedback on this issue would be much appreciated.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - EnityManager.close() before or after JTA afterCompletion()?</header>
    <body>Hi, See as a reference the https://community.jboss.org/message/794633#794633 thread. In an application server, that is JavaEE 6 compliant, which of EntityManager.close() and JTA Synchronization.afterCompletion() should be closed first? Based on the persistence specification: 7.9.1 Container Responsibilities: After the JTA transaction has completed (either by transaction commit or rollback), The container closes the entity manager by calling EntityManager.close. I am using DataNucleus (DN) 3.2 as a Persistence provider, and DN expects the Transaction afterCompletion() to be triggered BEFORE the EntityManager.close().  It seems that the opposite is triggered by JBoss.  So I wonder if both are correct or if one should be called before another based on either JTA or Persistence JSRs? Based on the thread dump, arjuna calls first: at org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAEntityManager.close(JPAEntityManager.java:194) at org.jboss.as.jpa.transaction.TransactionUtil$SessionSynchronization.afterCompletion(TransactionUtil.java:193) (EntityManager.close() is called first) Then JTA after completion: at org.datanucleus.TransactionImpl.internalPostCommit(TransactionImpl.java:563)             at org.datanucleus.JTATransactionImpl.afterCompletion(JTATransactionImpl.java:429)             at com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.resources.arjunacore.SynchronizationImple.afterCompletion(SynchronizationImple.java:96) Thanks</body>

    <body>Hi,   Iam new to jBPM and iam trying to setup an environment for doing a prototype, but unfortunately Iam not able to find an official documentation for doing this. I found a blog which talks about this here ﻿﻿﻿ https://community.jboss.org/people/bpmn2user/blog/2011/02/26/orcale-integration-with-jbpm5 https://community.jboss.org/people/bpmn2user/blog/2011/02/26/orcale-integration-with-jbpm5 . But I dont want to do this in bits and peices, do we have any script from jBPM which takes care of copying all the necessary jars(with proper versions) and make necessary configuration changes either in tomcat or jBPM ? Or atleast all the required steps documented any where in user/developer guide ? regards, Arif.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Design of AS7	multi-JSF feature</header>
    <body>These two related Jiras are about problems of integrating CDI with an installed JSF implementation that is not the default.  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-1628 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-1628 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-6129 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-6129 There is a workaround, however.  If I remember correctly, the workaround is to change the JSF impl that Weld is looking at.  Go into modules/org/jboss/as/weld/main/modules.xml and add your slot to the JSF API. &lt;module name="javax.faces.api" slot="myfaces-2.1.10"/&gt; Note that with this change you can only use Weld/CDI with one JSF impl at a time.  This limitation is slated to be fixed in AS7.2.x.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - JASPIC module not invoked after request#login</header>
    <body>I've installed a JASPIC (JASPI/JSR 196) SAM (login module) in JBoss EAP 6.01. It works and is invoked whenever a protected resource is accessed. However, when I call HttpServletRequest#login it's NOT invoked, and JBoss instead invokes the default file realm login module. Any rationale for this behavior?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - Re: JASPIC module not invoked after request#login</header>
    <body>Possiby. I forgot to mention btw that GlassFish and WebLogic also don't invoke the SAM after HttpServletRequest#login. So maybe they all have the same bug, or maybe it's a spec issue? As you have been involved with JSR 196 for a long time, do you know if this issue ever came up in EG discussions? JASPIC was finished before Servlet 3 was finished (nearly 2 years between them), so maybe that's the cause?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - JBoss AS7: Enabling JASPI Authentication for Web Applications</header>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - JBoss AS7: Enabling JASPI Authentication for Web Applications</header>
    <body>validateRequest *should* be called under HttpServletRequest.authenticate; but that has not yet been made explicit in the Servlet Profile of JSR 196 (and will be the subject of the next MR to the spec). ValidateRequest should not be called under HttpServletRequest.login mostly because login presumes a user name/password authentication mechanism (which may not be compatible with the configured auth context). it might be worth considering having login use the callback handler to handle a passwordValidationCallback (if jsr 196 is configured for the app), in which case the login impl login would need access to the same callback handler that was passed to the 196 auth context configured for the app. I will think about how that might be possible, but at this time, the main integration point for jsr 196 and programmatic login should be authenticate (not login).</body>

On JBoss AS 7.1.3 (or EAP 6.0.1), the feature is only partial. For example, @EJB injection doesn't work with my JSF 1.2 managed beans  :( . And the jsf subsystem doesn't exist yet.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - JBoss AS7: Enabling JASPI Authentication for Web Applications</header>
    <body>Ron, thank you so much for the response! Indeed, HttpServletRequest.authenticate works. I tested this using JBoss EAP 6.0.1, WebLogic 12.1.1, and GlassFish 3.1.2.2. It would help a lot of the next MR to the spec would state this explicitly. Are there already any plans for this MR? And being a MR, will there be some sort of open tracker where one can submit issues? Indeed, but that holds for proprietary login modules as well, doesn't it? The contract on HttpServletRequest.login already mentions something along those lines: +"This method returns without throwing a ServletException when the login mechanism configured for the ServletContext supports username password validation"+ + + Thanks again, it will be interesting to see what the options here are. If for some reason it really is not possible to handle HttpServletRequest.login with JSR 196, then maybe an exception should be thrown instead if jsr 196 is configured for the app? What happens now is that the call silently goes to a completely different login module. If this login module happened to store the username/password that the user is trying to authenticate with, he/she will be totally unexpected and silently authenticated with the wrong login module.</body>

It will need to be brief to fit with the ee 7 scheduling, but if you have any pressing issues with the spec please pass them on. I will also set up an issue tracker (but that may not be in time for this MR). I think that it would be your idea about throwing an exception from login, when a jsr 196 module is configured, sounds very good. I will work through that.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - AS 7 Internal	Architecture Overview</header>
    <body>h2. High Level Overview At a coarse level, AS 7 consists of two main elements: * A core manageable service container based on modular classloading * Extensions to that core that provide the kind of functionality most users associate with an application server, like handling HTTP requests and managing transactions The AS distribution also includes two clients for the management interfaces it exposes (a CLI tool and a web-based admin console). The AS codebase also produces implementations of the SPIs published by the Arquillian project, allowing AS7 servers to run Arquillian-based tests. h3. AS Core The core of the AS consists of the following primary elements: * A modular classloading system provided by the jboss-modules library * A fast, highly scalable service container framework provided by the jboss-msc library * An extensible management layer that is meant to mediate access to the service container by logic that wants to add, remove and modify services. The management layer also provides a consistent, persistent, configuration model for the AS. The management layer involves* core elements, via the jboss-dmr library and the AS's own controller, controller-client, deployment-repository, domain-management and network modules as well as parts of the server module * remote management capability via the protocol and domain-http modules * multi-server managed domains via the process-controller and host-controller modules * miscellaneous elements provided via the managment-client-content and platform-mbean modules * A deployment framework for coordinating installation of deployment content into the runtime. This is one of the things provided by the server module. h3. AS Extensions Most of the functionality that end users associate with an application server is provided AS extensions. Most of the modules in the AS7 codebase are extension implementations, with each extension providing a coherent set of functionality. Many extensions provide support for some aspect of the Java EE specifications. Extensions implement an interface (org.jboss.as.controller.Extension) that allows integration with the core AS management layer. Via that mechanism, extensions are able to * participate in the parsing and marshalling of the AS's configuration documents * register resources and operations to be exposed via the AS's management API * install services into the AS's service container * register deployment unit processors with the AS's deployment framework See the " https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Extending+JBoss+AS+7 Extending JBoss AS 7" document for more on extensions. See also  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 for more on how extending AS 7 differs from extending previous versions of JBoss AS. h2. AS7 Boot Process To better illustrate the AS 7 architecture, let's walk through the boot process for a standalone server. h3. Primordial Boot When you run bin/standalone.sh from the root of the AS 7 distribution, the final effect is to launch a JVM using the following essential command java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone If you start the AS and use the ps command to see the actual JVM launch command, you'll see a lot of JVM settings (-Xmx and the like) and a lot of system property settings, but the above bits are the key information. Let's break that down a bit: java -jar jboss-modules.jar We can see from this that the actual main class the VM will invoke isn't in a JBoss AS library at all; it's in jboss-modules.jar (specifically, the org.jboss.modules.Main class.) So, when you start the AS the first thing you are doing is setting up a modular classloading environment. -mp modules These are arguments passed to org.jboss.modules.Main.main(). The -mp is short for "module path" and the value is a path somewhat analogous to the value of an OS $PATH environment variable. Each item in the path is a location under which jboss-modules will look for a module when needed. If there is more than one item in the path, the items are searched in order, with the search ending as soon as the module is found. In this case there is only one item in the path -- the modules/ dir under the AS distribution root. org.jboss.as.standalone This is the name of a module located on the module path. This module will be loaded by jboss-modules. If you look in the modules/org/jboss/as/standalone/module.xml file in the AS distribution, you will see it includes this element: &lt;main-class name="org.jboss.as.server.Main"/&gt; When jboss-modules sees that element in the module.xml for the module passed to its main() method, it knows to load the specified class and to pass any remaining command line arguments into +its+ main() method. So, now we have a modular classloading enviroment set up, and the org.jboss.as.server.Main.main() method (found in the AS codebase's server module) has been invoked. The org.jboss.as.server.Main.main() method does a number of things, but two are most relevant for people who wish to understand how to develop the AS: * Any remaining command line arguments are processed and an instance of the ServerEnvironment is created. This object encapsulates environmental information available via the command line or system properties; things like where the root of the AS dist is; where the root of the server instance is; where the configuration file is, etc. Later this information is made available to all services in the system via the ServerEnvironmentService. * An object implementing the Bootstrap interface (specifically, the org.jboss.as.server.BootstrapImpl class) is created  and configured and its bootstrap() method is invoked. h3. Service-based Boot The most important thing BootstrapImpl does is create an instance of the JBoss MSC library's ServiceContainer interface. A service container manages a set of running services. A service is simply a thing that can be started and stopped, with start and stop performed via methods specified in the JBoss MSC Service interface. A service also exposes a value of some type T via the Service interface's public T getValue() method. The value type T specified by the service is used by default by consumers of the service, and should represent the public interface of the service. It may or may not be the same as the implementing type of the service. The ServiceContainer provides an API for managing services -- configuring and installing them, removing them, triggering start and stop, looking up already installed services, etc. Configuring a service can involve expressing the dependencies the service has on other services and asking that the service container inject the value of depended-upon services into the service before starting it. If a service depends upon another service, that other service must be successfully started before the service container will invoke the dependent service's start method. If for some reason the depended-upon service needs to be stopped, the service container will invoke the dependent service's stop method first. The ServiceContainer maintains an internal thread pool. In order to achieve highly performant management of large numbers of inter-related services, activities related to starting and stopping services are performed as a series of concisely scoped tasks, with the threads in the thread pool used to execute those tasks. For example, executing a service's start method would be a task performed by a thread in the ServiceContainer's thread pool. Because of this fact, +it is important to recognize that any activity related to starting and stopping services will be highly multi-threaded. For example, you can never assume that the thread that asks the service container to install a service will be the thread that calls its start method.+ So, at this point in our boot, we have in place two of the four main architectural elements discussed in the "AS Core" section of the "High Level Overview" above: a modular classloading environment provided by the jboss-modules library, and a service container framework provided by the jboss-msc library. Up to this point in the AS boot, all activity has been on a single thread, the JVM's main thread. In the BootstrapImpl.bootstrap() method, things get more interesting, since much of the remaining boot work involves installing services, with the ServiceContainer's thread pool threads doing the most of that work. BootstrapImpl.bootstrap() installs two services: * ControlledProcessStateService. This service provides access to a simple enum value showing the current running state of the server (STARTING, STOPPING, RUNNING, RESTART_REQUIRED, RELOAD_REQUIRED). This is the only service that once started should not be stopped until the VM is being shut down. * ApplicationServerService. This is the root service for the application server; all other services in one way or another depend upon it. When you use the CLI to perform the :reload operation, the server handles that request by telling the service container to stop this service, which has the effect of stopping all other services that depend upon it. Then once it is stopped, the service container is told to start the service again. The ApplicationServerService starts a number of other services in its start method. The most significant of these is the ServerService. h3. The ServerService and the Controller Boot Thread ServerService brings in the 3rd and 4th of the four primary components of the core AS listed in the "High Level Overview" above -- the extensible management layer and the deployment framework. For those of you familiar with the " https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Extending+JBoss+AS+7 Extending JBoss AS 7" document, ServerService performs many of the same kinds of activities an Extension implementation performs in its initialize(ExtensionContext context) method, but for the core AS management model: * registers resource definitions, attributes definitions and OperationStepHandlers for the core AS managed resources * registers core DeploymentUnitProcessors ServerService implements Service&lt;ModelController&gt;. A ModelController is the central execution point for management operations in a managed AS process (i.e. a server or a HostController in a managed domain.) In its start method, ServerService spawns a separate thread, the "Controller Boot Thread", which is responsible for coordinating the remainder of the boot. It does the following primary tasks * Triggers the parsing of the server configuration file (e.g. standalone.xml) into a list of management operations that should be executed by the ModelController to bring the server's running configuration in line with the xml configuration * Passes those management operations into the ModelController's execute method. The ModelController uses the Controller Boot Thread to handle execution of many of the steps involved in handling those operations. * Blocks until all services added into the runtime as part of handling those management ops have either started or failed to start. * Logs the completion of boot. The tasks of the Controller Boot Thread are spelled out in further detail below. h4. XML Parsing, Extension Loading, Extension Parsing Initialization The task of an XML parser for an AS7 configuration document (e.g. standalone.xml, domain.xml, host.xml) is to populate a list of management operations that should be executed by the ModelController to bring the process' running configuration in line with the xml. Each of those management operations has the same format as would be read off the wire if the CLI had sent an operation request to the server to invoke an equivalent operation. The parser for the core AS xml namespace has some special behavior when it comes to parsing an &lt;extension&gt; element in the xml: * The name attribute of the element is the name of a JBoss Modules module that contains an implementation of the org.jboss.as.controller.Extension interface * Once the name is parsed, the parser asks JBoss Modules to load the module * Once the module is loaded, the java.lang.ServiceLoader mechanism is used to load the module's implementation of the Extension interface. * The initializeParsers(ExtensionParsingContext context) on that Extension implementation is invoked. That allows the extension to register XML parsers for the XML namespaces supported by the subsystem(s) the extension provides. * When the core AS xml parser subsequently encounters a &lt;subsystem&gt; element in the configuration document, the xml namespace of the element is determined, and the appropriate parser registered by some Extension is used to parse that portion of the document. h4. Execution of Boot Management Operations, Extension Initialization Once xml parsing is complete, a list of management operations is ready for execution by the ModelController. Each operation has the same format (address, operation name, parameters) as would be read off the wire if the CLI had sent an operation request to the server to invoke an equivalent operation after boot. The Controller Boot Thread asks the ModelController to execute the operations as a unit, with each individual operation acting as a step in the overall unit of work. Execution process in 3 stages, with all steps in the overall unit completing a stage before execution on the next stage begins. (This execution pattern applies whenever any operation or atomic list of operations is invoked, not just during boot.) * Stage MODEL -- the OperationStepHandler registered for each operation makes necessary updates to the server's internal configuration model, and, if necessary, registers a handler for the same operation for Stage RUNTIME. * Stage RUNTIME -- any OperationStepHandler registered in Stage MODEL for an operation accesses the JBoss MSC ServiceContainer and installs/removes/updates any relevant services. The ServiceContainer has its own thread pool and uses it to perform the necessary tasks to start and stop services. The thread executing the OperationStepHandler does not do this directly, and the handler implementation needs to recognize that service start/stop will be asynchronous. * Stage VERIFY -- A Stage.MODEL or Stage.RUNTIME handler can register a Stage.VERIFY handler that will only run once the ServiceContainer had completed all service modifications made in stage RUNTIME. A VERIFY handler can check that the runtime services completed successfully. Before the list of boot operations is passed into the ModelController, a check is done for operations that add extension resources (for example, using CLI syntax, /extension=org.foo.extension:add.) When one is found, the relevant Extension implementation's initialize(ExtensionContext context) method is invoked. This gives the Extension a chance to register its resource and attribute definitions and OperationStepHandlers with the core AS management layer before the boot operations are executed. h4. Wait for Service Container Stability and Boot Completion The final steps in the AS 7 boot are to wait while the JBoss MSC ServiceContainer processes the installation and start of all the services added by the handlers for the boot operations. As discussed in the introduction to the ServiceContainer above, the start of services is performed by threads in the ServiceContainer's internal thread pool. Services are not started by the Controller Boot Thread. However, the ServerService attaches a listener to the controller object for each service; using this the ServerService is able to track when all services have reached a stable state. The Controller Boot Thread uses this facility to block until the ServiceContainer has stabilized. At that point, all services are either started or failed, and boot is nearly complete. The Controller Boot Thread switches the state of the ControlledProcessState service from STARTING to RUNNING, writes a log message reporting that the boot is complete, and boot is finished. h2. Deployment Processing When you trigger deployment of some content, one of the management operations supported by the core AS management layer is invoked. The logic responsible for handling that operation will extract relevant information from the operation request (e.g. the name of the deployment) and will then install services into the AS's service container: * A Service&lt;VirtualFile&gt; implementation that provides an org.jboss.vfs.VirtualFile that represents the deployment content. * A Service&lt;DeploymentUnit&gt; (in this case RootDeploymentUnitService) that provides a DeploymentUnit for the deployment. A DeploymentUnit retains data which is persistent for the life of the deployment, and will later be passed into the various DeploymentUnitProcessor implementations that perform various actions to install the runtime services needed by the deployment. The RootDeploymentUnitService has injected into it a reference to all the DeploymentUnitProcessor (DUP) implementations that were registered by the core ServerService at boot or that have been registered by subsystems. The DUP implementations are grouped by the Phase of the deployment process in which they execute, and are numerically ordered within that phase. Deployment proceeds in phases. See the  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/server/deployment/Phase.java Phase enum for a listing of the phases. For each phase, a DeploymentUnitPhaseService representing that phase that is installed into the service container. Each phase service (save the first) depends on the phase service for the previous phase, and each phase service (save the last) in its start method installs the phase service for the next phase. The RootDeploymentUnitService in its start method installs the first phase service, which in turn depends on it the RootDeploymentUnitService. The effect of all this is if the RootDeploymentUnitService is stopped (e.g. by the undeploy management operation), this will trigger a requirement for the service container to first stop the first phase service, which will in turn trigger a requirement to first stop the next phase service, and so on all the way to the final phase service. The effect is the phase services will be stopped in reverse order from how they were started. The primary thing the phase services do in their start and stop methods is invoke the deploy and undeploy methods of each DeploymentUnitProcessor registered for their phase. The deploy method is invoked in phase service start and the undeploy method is invoked in stop. For each deploy/undeploy call the DUP is provided with a DeploymentPhaseContext that provides context to the call and gives the DUP access to the service container, allowing it to install or remove services.</body>

Tools and technologies h2. Java JBoss Tools requires Java 6. Ensure your JRE and JDK are compatible with Java 6 h2. Eclipse PDE/RCP JBoss Tools are a set of plugins for Eclipse. Then get your favourite recent version of Eclipse from here:  http://eclipse.org/downloads/ http://eclipse.org/downloads/ We recommand you using +Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers+. But you can also install PDE in any other installation of Eclipse: https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-18124-5-18511/installPDE.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-18124-5-18511/450-477/installPDE.png h2. SVN You'll need to install a recent version of SVN (1.6 or more recent). Then you should install SVN Tools in Eclipse.  You are free to choose your favourite Eclipse plugin and SVN connector by yourself, however, curret author of this page recommands using Subversive (part of the Eclipse latest release site) with SVNKit connector. Feel free to install Subversive extensions for other projects, it's always helpful. h2. Tips for productivity and quality Here are some highly recommanded plugins that will make your more efficient when inside the IDE h3. Install Code Recommanders Provides additional snippets, templates and smart completion. Not intrusive. You can find it on the "Juno" update-site or the current Eclipse release site. h3. Static analysis Static analysis will detect bug very early and will save you minutes of debug every day. Using it will make you and your colleagues happier. It tells you while typing code that you may have a bug. No need to wait for running test or CI reports to detect this. h4. Enable all JDT warnings JDT provides very good static analysis, and can prevent you from writing bugs. You simply have to turn all "ignored" advices to "warning" in Window &gt; Preference &gt; Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Errors/Warning. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-18124-5-18512/jdtWarnings.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-18124-5-18512/450-431/jdtWarnings.png h4.

Install PMD for Eclipse http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pmd-eclipse http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pmd-eclipse h3. Coverage Coverage answers to the question "What is tested or net?". JBoss Tools CI builds provide Jacoco reports for coverage by unit tests (file name is jacoco.exec). This file can easily be analyzed inside Eclipse on your Java editor using EclEmma plugin:  http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclemma-java-code-coverage http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclemma-java-code-coverage h1. Get source Each JBoss Tools component is now its own GitHub repo:  https://github.com/jbosstools/ https://github.com/jbosstools/ h2. To work on a specific component The easiest way to get started is to check out source for only the module you wish to work on, and import Java projects from this part of the source tree. Example: * I  want to fix a bug in CDI component of JBT: git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-server.git and import plugins and tests projects from plugns/* and tests/* h1. Set up a target platform Target platforms (TP) are aimed at specifying what are the dependencies allowed and used to write, compile and execute code. *Target Platform=Build Path + Default Runtime Classpath.* We provide several TP that have different purpose. We do set up some default TP for development, that you should use. h2. Import target platforms Import into your Eclipse workspace JBoss Tools target platforms from GitHub: git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build.git You can then build a specific target platform like this: cd jbosstools-build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR1a/; mvn clean install h2. Choose and use a target platform Then go into Window &gt; Preference &gt; Plug-in development &gt; Target Platform. We recommend you to use *multiple.target* since it will contain all deps allowed from 3rd-party (Eclipse, Google...) *AND SOURCE BUNDLES*. If you don't depend on any other JBoss Tools project, please use *unified.target*. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-18124-5-18513/TP.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-18124-5-18513/450-333/TP.png h1. Run JBoss Tools and Tests from your IDE Once Target Platform is configured, you can easily give a try to your plugins using +Run As &gt; Java Application.+ You can also run automated tests from your IDE using +Run As... &gt; JUnit Plugin Tests+.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>My main concern was if we had to generate patches from sources instead of using a binary. As long as patches are generated from binaries, we won't have checksum issues. This could be a "nice to have" feature but I'd prefer to postpone that when we have deeper insights on how patches are generated and used instead of introducing more complexity from the start.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>Fair enough; I have no argument with that philosophy at all. I think a lot of one off patches will be generated from source though. The support people will checkout the code for the version being patched, make whatever changes, and then build. The result of that build will be the --updated-dist used by the patch-gen tool. I could be wrong though; they may build jars and then copy them into a pristine dist and use that as their --updated-dist. Or they could skip the copy, use the dist produced by the build, but use the specified-content approach in the patch-config.xml. We'll see!</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Developing for JBoss	Tools</header>
    <body>JBoss Tools is a large conglomerate of plugins and components from many different locations. This page will help committers and hackers navigate the process of setting up a development environment, contribute patches, and navigate any approval processes required. *Development Environment* The first thing any developers will want to know is  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18124 How to set up your development environment. This involves choosing which eclipse you'll want to install, your choices of java, subversion, eclipse target platform, which parts of the svn tree to checkout, and how to run tests from inside your IDE. *Building JBoss Tools * Not all contributors will want to go through the trouble, but, if you really want to make sure your changes work the same in PDE's runtime environment (inside eclipse) as they do from a tycho build, which is the build system we use, you'll also want to try to build your project via the command line. You'll be able to set up your first builds by reading How to build JBoss Tools with Maven 3 (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16604). All committers are expected to build their component locally and verify the tests still pass before committing any major patches. Sometimes, running your test suite in PDE vs in Tycho (command line build) have different results in the test suite. This is unfortunate, but it *does* happen. If you're getting inconsistant results, and really need to figure out what's going wrong, you'll want to read about  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15209 Using Eclipse for Remote Debugging Tycho Build. *Submitting / Committing patches* All commits should reference a jira. All committers are required to have a jira target in every svn commit message. This helps keep our history easy to trace back through when searching for regressions. This helps keep us aware of what use cases caused the regression, and what to look out for and re-test when reverting or re-fixing an issue. Without a jira reference, if "fixing" one regression might create a new one, we'll have no way to find out why the change was committed in the first place, or what the change thought it was fixing. In general, the process for submitting / committing a patch is: 1) Open a jira describing the bug 2) Attach the patch to the jira. 3) If you are a core developer,       a) simply commit the patch. Otherwise,       b) assign the issue to the component lead asking for approval and assistence in committing. 4) Resolve the issue as "done". Make sure to target the fix version accurately. Try to make sure your description, or at least a closing comment, reference exactly how to replicate the issue, so that QE can verify that the issue is fixed. This also helps maintain the integrity of our code. *What happens after a commit?* For those very curious contributors, core developers, or testers, This Image (/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-18462-4-18759/HowWeBuild_Diagram.png) shows what happens in our infrastructure upon a commit. In short, a hudson jobs get kicked off to build the component, and rebuild any components that depend on it, and push all changes to update sites. You can get a good look at what update sites are used and where over at this (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18462) article. Knowing what update site to use is very useful for anyone using bleeding-edge nightly builds. *Documentation* Committers and component owners are expected to keep their documentation up to date.They will also need to learn how to  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-13341 Build their Documentation. *Other development tasks* Working with branches is also a bit complicated, since our build system may (depending on the flags used) install items into your maven repository. The Working with Branches (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17497) article will be very helpful here. * * There are other more complicated development tasks that require much more approvals than a simple commit. Creating or removing top-level components from our svn tree have processes associated with them (or will soon  ;) ). Moving plugins, tests, or features between components also require such approvals. * * 1) Adding a new top-level component: Approval Process and Technical Process (TODO) 2) Adding a plugin, feature, or test, to a component: Approval Processt (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-21382) and Technical Process (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373) (TODO) 3) Deleting a plugin, feature, or test, from a component: Approval Process and Technical Process (TODO) 4) Deleting a top-level component: Approval Proces and Technical Process (TODO) 5) Moving a plugin, feature, or test, from one component to another: Approval Process and Technical Process (TODO) 6) Adding a different component as a dependency to your component.  Approval Process and Technical Process (TODO) 7) Addition of external dependencies requiring an adjustment to target platform: Approval Process and Technical Process (TODO) Some of these tasks may not seem complicated, but, they still require wide distribution and notification on the proper mailing lists, and in some cases, followup jiras to the build team. While adding a component as a dependency to your plugin might seem simple, it has the potential to cause circular dependencies, or simply cause  extra builds and waste resources. Often, the build team needs to be alerted to these changes to adjust their cascading builds scripts and properly position your jobs where they belong. *Maintenance and Rampdown procedures* * * Maintenance releases typically contain only bug-fixes, with no additional features. While there is no official process declared yet, in general, maintenance patches require approval from PM or at the very least another committer on the same component. During rampdown for a major release, such as during candidate releases, similar restrictions are in place. Look here for more information in the future. During maintenance releases, all forms of api breakage are forbidden. While there is often debate as to what exactly constitutes an api breakage, this  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2 eclipse document can help identify what constitutes api breakages and what doesn't. One thing to be aware of is that adding a public or protected method or field to any class that may subclassed DOES constitute a breakage. In theory, a subclass may have a method or field of the same name or signature. However the risk for these situations will be evaluated separately and may still be allowed into maintenance if the risk is low.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Authentication Service</header>
    <body>h1. Authentication Service This article is do describe the new authentication service being added to AS7 to support security context proagation and connection re-authentication.  Until the component is complete this article should be considered work in progress. Due to the dependencies involved this service is developed as a stand alone project that will be subsequently integrated into the application server, most likely the security subsystem. h3. Project Structure The project (will) provide(s) the following: - h4. Authentication Service This is the core service running within the application server, this service is associated with all supported security realms and handles the authentication requests and the providing of the authenticated identities internally. h4. Server API Fer secured services looking to use the identities an API will be provided for direct access to the service.  A permissions check on the SecurityManager (if any) will be performed to verify the call should be allowed, user code must not be able to interact with the service unless that permission is granted. The server API may also provide an API that can be mapped to domain management operations to allow the state of the authentication service and the connection to be managed. h4. Internal Client API On the client side calls will be made to the remote authentication service using the defined protocol over Remoting - to simplify the use of the protocol this will be wrapped by an API - however this is most likely not the API that the clients will use to manage the associated identities. h4. Public Client API This is the API that will be used by client applications to manipulate the identities associated with the current connection, use cases are being identified and the resulting API will be to solve those use cases. h4. Versioned Remoting Protocol The protocol itself will live in it's own module, client and server side of the protocol will be written in parallel to ensure they remain in synch.  h3. Remoting Protocol The protocol is a versioned protocol, this means that the client and server will negotiate to use the most up to date protocol that both sides understand.  The only exception to this is that both sides will also allow for versions to be excluded either through configuration, their APIs or by system properties - the reason for this is that if a vulnerability or bug is found in a version of the protocol it can be excluded - this is applicable even for older versions as you may not want a client to force the use of an older version with a known issue. The versioning will also indicate if the protocol version is from a Final release or an intermediate release, backwards compatibility is only maintained within a protocol once it has reached the final state. h3. Application Server Integration h4. Configuration Items to be configured within the application server: - The service itself is a generic service, initially this is being used for EJB invocations however this can potentially be used for all services so the configuration of the service needs to be central - I would suggest within the security subsystem. The service will only be installed if the configuration is present. * Available Realms * Advertise Realms?  Should clients be able to request a list of available realms. * SASL Configuration - the capabilities of the realms guide this but additional overrides may be needed. * Caching configuration - validity periods? limit per connection? h4. EJB Container The EJB container will need to be modified so that if a request is received with a token ID then the Server API should be used to obtain that identity and run the request as that identity. Where a call is being made to a remote server there needs to be some form of switch to enable propagating the identity to the remote server, this most likely needs an API option and a configuration option to enable it. h4. EJB Clients The EJB client side in conjunction with the public client API will need to support the client side management and switching of identities and the passing of the selected token with the method invocation. h4. Security Realms The security realms now need to be updated as to support this feature a user authenticating to the server needs to be able request an alternative id for the authorization decisions.</body>

    <body>So I have read how to dynamically re-write the web service soap address https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/JBWS/Advanced+User+Guide https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/JBWS/Advanced+User+Guide JBoss 7.0.2 soap rewrite issue https://community.jboss.org/thread/198473 https://community.jboss.org/thread/198473 Web services configuration 7.1.x https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Web+services+configuration https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Web+services+configuration soap:address rewrite in 7.1.1. Final https://community.jboss.org/message/734787#734787 https://community.jboss.org/message/734787 and I can set through server properties (host and port), or &lt;wsdl-host&gt;jbossws.undefined.host&lt;/wsdl-host&gt; However my case is that I want the service to be exposed via the web server. So, one might say then IP and Port should be webserver ip:80 but my case is a little more complicated a) I have 2 web servers utilizing mod_cluster to loadbalance and failover http requests to my 2 JBoss server b) Both my servers contain the web service The aim is to have requests to the webservice exposed via the webservers (ie. URL rewrite has to cater for this)  and the web servers be able to loadbalance the requests. I am unsure how both can be achieved because a) The web server loadbalances AJP requests to 8009 b) The server rewrites the URL of my web service to 8080 and of course only one can be written there Maybe it is easy as the JBoss web will re-direct the requests from AJP 8009 to 8080 but wanted to be certain if it is just that simple</body>

    <body>This file appears to be created during the JBoss build itself, only later on in the build cycle.  Because I started with a vanilla maven repository, it would make sense that this file wouldn't be present due to build ordering.  Would it be possible to alter the build order so that spec-api is build prior to Arquillian, or is there a transitive dependency from spec-api to arquillian TestNG Integration? If so, perhaps pulling that test out and executing it in its own module after spec-api is built would be an answer.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Missing file from Nexus preventing build of Arquillian TestNG Integration</header>
    <body>This file is created by the spec-api module, which is created much later in the build process. The way I see it, there are two possible solutions: 1. Move the arquillian modules to after the spec-api module. 2. Create a module specifically for arquillian-testng and execute that module immediately after spec-api is built.  The only other module that has a dependency on jboss-as-arquillian-testng-integration is test-suite which runs after spec-api. Also, all of the other Arquillian modules build fine, and there are numerous dependencies on the other arquillian modules in the build process.  With this in mind, I think option 2 is probably best. Either way, I think this deserves a Jira. I can implement whichever solution you folks would like and submit a patch to the ticket tomorrow. The only reason I found this was because I started the build with a from a blank .m2/repository. If Jenkins isn't clearing out the .m2/repository prior to the build that then this would have only shown up the first time a build was done. After that, the file produced by spec-api would be installed into the repository and the problem would have gone away. Thoughts? -- Mike Van Apache Software Foundation, Committer</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JAR blacklist for	deployment</header>
    <body>Countless times that I've seen, a JBoss system JAR somehow gets accidentally deployed to the EAR/WAR file that we are trying to launch on JBoss. Instead of giving a warning or an error stating that your web app contained this system jar on accident, it will instead lead you down several different misleading scenarios trying to fix the issue: Class Not Found errors are very common because of the conflicting objects in the class loader, but you also sometimes get a wonderfully nested exception causing you to waste a lot of time before only realizing... oops! doh. duh! there's jboss-ee.jar. This especially happens when a new developer takes over some old project. While attempting to resurrect the build process for an older application, it's actually pretty common to accidentally deploy a system jar or two. While getting the maven dependencies back working, it's common to forget to set a scope to "provided." Or Eclipse when you include JBoss as a user library, you may forget to tell Eclipse not to write custom libraries to the deployment. We should create a blacklist of JAR MANIFEST.MF files that will at very least generate something like: [WARN] YOU CHECKING IN A BLACKLISTED JAR. YOU ARE LIKELY AN IDIOT. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BE AN IDIOT? What do you guys think? If you like it I'll generate a new feature request and a Pull Request.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: JAR blacklist for	deployment</header>
    <body>First of all, thanks for the feedback. I'm glad you think it's a good idea. So as a follow up: what do you I'm looking for your opinions on the best strategy for coming up with the best default list of blacklisted JARs. In other words, JARs that are NEVER ok to have in your deployment. I need to: a) how to check to see if a JAR has been blacklisted. b) getting a list of blacklisted JARs My ideas for (a): * Collect store a SHA1 checksum for all blacklisted JARs and store in text file *conf/blacklist.properties*. Load the checksum list as a dictionary during server startup. Validate SHA1 checksum for JARs deployed to verify none match a blacklisted JAR from the dictionary. * Just store the MANIFEST.MF for all blacklisted JARs in a special directory within *conf/blacklisted-jar-manifests*. During deployment, check all JAR manifests don't match a blacklisted one. * Instead of blacklisting JARs, blacklist certain Classes that if found in any JAR within your deployment will cause the warning. ----&gt; This is the one I'm leaning towards. My ideas for (b): List of all JBoss system JARs: For AS4-6: Blacklist all JARs in client/jboss*.jar, server/default/lib/jboss*.jar, and server/all/lib/jboss*.jar That is a good default list for now. Any ideas on this? </body>

    <body>Instead, you need to convert the URL into a filesystem path (which hopefully will work) and then do: I haven't tried this. The bigger problem is the fact that you are going to be writing to the module. That means when we patch the module and we attempt to detect if the user has modified the module so we can require that we approve the override, we're going to see that the module doesn't have the same hash as the original one did when we prepared the patch.</body>

    <body>Of course, any modifications made to the ear at runtime will be lost when the patch is applied, since the old version of the module will no longer take precedence on the module path and will not be used. I recommend you talk to the portal folks about how I recommended they deal with a requirement to use an exploded deployment. In their case it was user-modifiable and couldn't be deployed from inside a module. Better yet, just write to the data/ dir or something and don't write inside the ear.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Connection Re-Authentication and Security Propagation [DRAFT / Work In Progress]</header>
    <body>h2. Introduction The purpose of this article is to outline the problems that we are attempting to solve and the solution currently being considered, this work is being tracked under the following Jira issue: - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5901 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5901 Currently for remote EJB invocations (Actually all invocations to the server but in this case EJB invocations are the priority) a Remoting connection is established by the client, early in establishing this connection the remote client performs authentication using SASL - once authenticated the authentication is valid for the life of the connection.  As EJB invocations are received the identity on this connection is the identity used for the EJB call. The following diagram illustrates the exising calls for remote EJB clients: - https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19891/Existing+Calls+%281%29.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19891/Existing+Calls+%281%29.png The established connection here is a Remoting connection, the connection itself is independent of any service being accessed and on establishing the connection authentication is performed using the associated realm.  Subsequently when the client connects to the EJB Container and sends a request to a deployed EJB the identity used for the EJB call is the identity taken from the underlying connection.  As the authentication takes place as the connection is established the only way for the clients to send in requests as an alternative user is to establish a new connection as the new user. A second scenario is where the call is also passed from one server to another: - https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19892/Existing+Calls+C--S--S.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19892/Existing+Calls+C--S--S.png In this second scenario there is now a connection from the first server to the second server, this connection also requires authentication and the call to the EJB on the second server runs as the identity of this second connection. These two diagrams illustrate the problems to be solved: - * For a client to run as different identities different connections are required for each identity. * For a server to server call the identity on the second server is the identity of the connection and not the original caller. h3. Remoting Authentication Before reviewing alternative solutions it is worth describing the decisions relating to the authentication of the actual connection as at the very minimum it is desirable that we do not undermine this with a solution that allows interception of the exchanges in such a way that either passwords are revealed or items are revealed that could be basis for a plain text attack. When a client attempts to connect to the Remoting connection a challenge is sent back to the client containing a list of supported authentication SASL mechanisms that the client can select from to attempt to authenticate, the client selects on and attempts the authentication.  If authentication succeeds then the client can then request to connect to the service it wished to use, if not the client is re-challenged with the list of mechanisms and this is repeated until the client either successfully authenticates or the list is exhausted. The SASL mechanisms that are offered are selected based on the capabilities of the backing user store - as an example if we have a user store what we can query to obtain the users password or a pre-prepared hash of their password we offer the client the Digest-MD5 mechanism - however if we can only verify a supplied password but not generate the hashes required for Digest based authenitcation then PLAIN is offered as a mechanism. A second SASL mechanism that we also support is the External mechanism, this mechanism is a special mechanism in that it automatically authenticates as an identity associated with the surrounding connection - currently we use this for ClientCert style authentication where after a TLS connection is established authentication will then proceed based on the clients certificate. Another mechanism that we are currently adding support for is GSSAPI, this is a mechanism that authenticates a user by the use of authentication tokens with no exchange of passwords between the points involved in the authentication process. The ability to authenticate using these different approaches where we can reduce the places where either passwords or replayable tokens are visible is the key reason why we do not want to introduce those kind of vulnerabilities in the solution to the two problems being described here. h2. Proposed Solutions This section describes the solutions currently considered and where appropriate describes why those solutions are currently discounted, at this point this is intended to be for discussion rather than a final definitive decision. h3. Solution from Previous Releases In previous AS releases unless a custom RMI socket was used the connections to the application server were not authenticated, instead the username and credential would be passed along with the EJB invocation and intercepted before the call reached the EJB - the supplied information would then be used to authenticate the remote user before allowing the call to proceed. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19893/Previous+AS+Calls.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19893/Previous+AS+Calls.png Where a client wanted to run as multiple identities that was fine as for each invocation a different username and password could be set for the call. This approach also potentially allowed for the security context to be passed onto subsequent servers as the contents from this message invocation are available. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19894/Previous+AS+Calls+C--S--S.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19894/Previous+AS+Calls+C--S--S.png Whilst this approach does solve the problem of being able to switch identities and propagate identities it suffers from the problem that the users password is sent in the clear so should we undertake a similar solution for AS7 it would undermine the protection available from the currently available SASL mechanisms, in addition to this it is assuming that a username / password based authentication is always the approach we will want to take even though there are now alternative mechanisms in common use. h3. Reauthenticate The Connection As the calls are executed as the identity of the connection one approach could be to allow the client side to initiate a re-authentication of the connection so that a different identity can be used. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19895/Reauthenticate+Whole+Connection.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19895/Reauthenticate+Whole+Connection.png Whilst this would allow a client to switch identities and it could potentially be implemented using the SASL mechanisms the biggest issue here is if the client is multi-threaded and wants to run as multiple identities concurrently.  At best the client would need to maintain a pool of connections one for each identity in use and if all identities could be used at once then it is no better than the current situation. The multi threaded client issue is also made worse in the server to server case where sharing a single connection would be a major benefit in reducing the resources used. For the server to server case there is also the issue regarding how is the users identity propagated to the second server, for this possible solution the multi-threaded client problem appears to be sufficiently blocking so will cover that in subsequent solutions.</body>

    <body>A Question regarding the JVM spec and how javassist is expected to handle it. I’ve an interface IMyFactory extending the Remote interface. It declares a method foo() which declares throws RemoteException so will be deemed as remotable API The implementing class implements the method but *doesn’t* declare itself as throwing the remote. Code wise the JVM picked this method as valid Remote API Javassist when interrogated class MyFactory.foo() method doesn’t provide any data on its being a throwing RemoteException *Questions* 1. The JVM spec defines a method by its name and properties, not by its exception throwing. In addition it allows an implementing method to declare less “throws” then its super / defining interface without loss of polymorphism 1. e.g. this foo() implementer is deemed the same as in the interface. Why wont javassist provide me the exception data defined in the Interface’s CtClass ?    2) Is there a “recoursive” API in javassist that will wllow me to intergoate a method up to its interface definition to see if some one above it has defined it to be an         Throwable thrower or do I need to implement such search myself ? *Code example:* 1. 1.

About 6 GB of free disk space if you want to run all integration tests for (JBoss AS, Seam and Web Services Tools) - *requires VPN access* 4. subversion client 1.6.X  (should work with lower version as well, but newer versions may not work as expected) h3. Maven and Java Make sure your maven 3 is available by default and Java 1.6 is used. mvn -version should  print out something like *Apache Maven 3.0.3* (r1075438; 2011-02-28 12:31:09-0500) *Java version: 1.6.0_25*, vendor: Sun Microsystems Inc. *Java home: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_25/jre* Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8 OS name: "linux", version: "2.6.42.3-2.fc15.x86_64", arch: "amd64", family: "unix" h3. Maven settings Follow https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15170  these instructions to add reference to JBoss Repositories into your settings.xml. You'll also probably need access to the SNAPSHOT repository.

To work around this, just build them locally: cd /tmp; svn co http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/ mvn install -U -f build/parent/pom.xml mvn install -U -f build/tycho-plugins/pom.xml mvn install -U -f build/target-platforms/pom.xml -Pjbosstools-maximum,jbosstools-minimum h3. Maven &amp; Java Memory Configuration To configure the amount of memory used by Maven, you can define MVN_OPTS as follows, either in the mvn / mvn.bat script you use to run Maven, or set as global environment variables. Here's how to do so for  http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=262465 Fedora,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables Ubuntu,  http://forums.techarena.in/windows-xp-support/1152405.htm Windows,  http://www.digitaledgesw.com/node/31 OSX. set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m h2. Verify or Install ? +mvn verify+ will perform all build and test steps, but it won't install the bundles in your local repository. +mvn install+ does install in you local repository. When an eclipse-plugin is installed in your repo, it is always used as default when resolving dependency. It is not possible to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, +mvn verify+ is to be prefered to +mvn install+. However, if you want to build stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use +mvn install+. In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if your use-case requires it. h2. About Target Platform and related profiles The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from this TP are allowed to be used in code. If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&amp;summary=Add%20[YOUR%20REQ]%20to%20Target%20Platform&amp;components=12310540&amp;issuetype=13&amp;Create=Create open a ticket to request it. Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's up to you to choose the one that match your needs: h3. Using published Target Platform definition (Recommanded) unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target Platfrom repository. * Pros:* No additional thing to do than invoking Maven * Always up-to-date * Cons: Speed - (to evaluate) Consume it by adding* +-Punified.target+* to you Maven invocation command-line h3. Or, getting a local copy of the Target Platform * Pros: Speed +++ * Cons: Step to be repeated whenever  https://source.jboss.org/browse/JBossTools/trunk/build/target-platform/unified.target target platform changes h4. Get it h5.  Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder on your disk. For convenience, the easiest is to unzip into jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/, since that's where the Maven or Ant process will by default operate. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url:       http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/e420-wtp340.target.zip e420-wtp340.target.zip (current minimum TP)       http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/e421-wtp341.target.zip e421-wtp341.target.zip (current maximum TP) and then unzip it : unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/my jbosstools/build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR0c/local/target/REPO/   or unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/my jbosstools/build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR1a/local/target/REPO/ *(Note that the default path used for &lt;local.site&gt; will change every time a new target platform is released which is a significant change over the previous (eg., SR1, SR2), so if this breaks because the default not points at an empty folder, it's time to get a new TP! Hurray for build-time notification you're using an old target platform!)* h5. OR, use Maven+Ant to get it In that case, you also need Ant 1.8.2 or later*.* cd jbosstools/build/target-platform mvn clean install -Pget.local.target The get.local.target profile will resolve the target platform file, multiple.target, as a p2 repository on your local disk in ~/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/. It may take a while, so you're better off from a speed point-of-view simply fetching the latest zip [5]. However, if you want to see what actually happens to create the TP (as done in Hudson) this is the approach to take. Since the Maven profile is simply a wrapper call to Ant, you can also use Ant 1.8 or later directly: cd jbosstools/build/target-platform ant help # show usage instructions h4. Use it h4. As Maven mirror (Recommended) Once you get the target platform available locally, you can use it instead of the remote sites to save time. For this, we can simply use Tycho target-platform mirroring:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors So you can simply edit to your ~/.m2/settings.xml the definition of the repositories to mirror: |  | | &lt;settings&gt;      &lt;mirrors&gt; &lt;!-- IMPORTANT: Sites in target platforms: must not have trailing slash! --&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/e420-wtp340.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/e421-wtp341.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/jbds600-e420-wtp340.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/jbds600-e421-wtp341.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;     &lt;/mirrors&gt; &lt;/settings&gt; | h4. OR, with local profiles (DEPRECATED) Just add -*P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///path/to/target/repository/* *NOTE:* You must specify a path starting with *file:///* (three or more slashes) to avoid errors such as "+p2.core.ProvisionException URI has an authority component+". Examples *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site *-Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/* &gt; build.all.log.txt h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platform and want to test it locally. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. This is only necessary when the TP change, prior to 3.3.Beta3 svn co http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk jbosstools cd jbosstools/build/parent mvn clean install ...

Building Individual Components Locally Via Commandline h3. Build a component resolving to a recent aggregation build for other JBT dependencies (Recommanded) * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * Speed to resolve deps: + * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons:* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change. More risk to get out of sync than with the staging site. Tracked by  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 example: *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-staging-aggregate* h3. Build a component resolving to the latest CI builds for other JBT dependencies * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change * Speed to resolve deps: - This profile is the one use for CI builds on Hudson. *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-nightly-staging-composite* h3. Build a component along with all its dependencies from sources ("bootstrap" build) This will build exactly what you have locally * Pros:* You are sure of the version of sources that is used for your JBT dependencies * You don't loose time in resolving your JBT deps * Cons:* You need sources for your dependencies too * You often build more stuff that what you really want to test cd ~/trunk/build mvn verify  -P unified.target -*P jmx-bootstrap* h2. Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean verify -P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/    or mvn3 clean verify  -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/ &gt; build.all.log.txt If you downloaded the zip and unpacked is somewhere else, use -Dlocal.site=file:///.../ to point at that folder instead h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-57-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-57-13876/310-276/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-57-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-57-13877/450-259/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: +clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file://home/nboldt/tmp/JBT_REPO_Indigo/+ Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-57-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-57-13878/450-540/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-57-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-57-13879/450-538/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-57-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-57-13880/450-539/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-57-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-57-13881/450-542/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-57-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-57-13882/450-347/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/runtime.site.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., Runtime Detection depends on JBoss Common, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. Dealing with timeouts for tests (To be rewritten soon...)  http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during indigo builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - HornetQ issue while started on 7.1.3.Final</header>
    <body>After suceesful jboss AS 7.1.3.Final startup on standalone-full configuration some warning regarding disconnection on hornetq occurs. It's raw start-up with no changes and no deployments. Do anyone had such similar issues? Once I remove connection pooling this warning will disapear but would be good to know what's the issue.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - How to use modules with ServiceLoader....</header>
    <body>Hi, we switched recently to JBoss 7(from 5:) We have some "strange" design. Our ear application is using Java ServiceLoader service to load some, let's say, plugins from "plugins" folder we created in profile directory. We can change these jars only during server restart. Now what I want to reach using jBoss 7. - I'd like to be able to redeploy "plugins" jar on the fly i.e. using Maven jboss-as-plugin. - Have possibility to drop the jars in the deployment folder to redeploying them. - Maybe utilize the JBoss modules framework to do this(but I'm affraid of these dependencies and modules.xmls etc. seams to complicated) So mainly is there a possibility to redeploy jars on the fly? Can I create one module, with all plugins inside, just to enable loading from main ear's ServiceLoader?(the ear will need only one dependency to this module with all plugins) What exactly are the "dynamic modules" how can I use them, static are copyied to "modules" folder, what about these dynamic ones? Isn't the easiest solution just to use extracted ear and copy/ overwrite the plugins in the /lib folder? What if the plugins formerly loaded only throught ServiceLoader have dependencies on the ear's libraries? Can ear have dependency on a module and the module dependency back to the ear??? What exactly happens when module is loaded, is just the module classpath added to the dependent ear's classpath??? When I some how redeploy the module will it stop the parent ear file? Sorry for so many question, that are not so clear, because I have mixed so much things together, but just starting to understand this area. But any hints how can I "Hot deploy" plugins, probably using jboss module, are really appreciated. Best regards to all of you. M.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Connection Re-Authentication and Security Propagation [DRAFT]</header>
    <body>h2. Introduction The purpose of this article is to outline the problems that we are attempting to solve and the solution currently being considered, this work is being tracked under the following Jira issue: - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5901 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5901 Currently for remote EJB invocations (Actually all invocations to the server but in this case EJB invocations are the priority) a Remoting connection is established by the client, early in establishing this connection the remote client performs authentication using SASL - once authenticated the authentication is valid for the life of the connection.  As EJB invocations are received the identity on this connection is the identity used for the EJB call. The following diagram illustrates the exising calls for remote EJB clients: - https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19891/Existing+Calls+%281%29.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19891/Existing+Calls+%281%29.png The established connection here is a Remoting connection, the connection itself is independent of any service being accessed and on establishing the connection authentication is performed using the associated realm.  Subsequently when the client connects to the EJB Container and sends a request to a deployed EJB the identity used for the EJB call is the identity taken from the underlying connection.  As the authentication takes place as the connection is established the only way for the clients to send in requests as an alternative user is to establish a new connection as the new user. A second scenario is where the call is also passed from one server to another: - https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19892/Existing+Calls+C--S--S.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19892/Existing+Calls+C--S--S.png In this second scenario there is now a connection from the first server to the second server, this connection also requires authentication and the call to the EJB on the second server runs as the identity of this second connection. These two diagrams illustrate the problems to be solved: - * For a client to run as different identities different connections are required for each identity. * For a server to server call the identity on the second server is the identity of the connection and not the original caller. h3. Remoting Authentication Before reviewing alternative solutions it is worth describing the decisions relating to the authentication of the actual connection as at the very minimum it is desirable that we do not undermine this with a solution that allows interception of the exchanges in such a way that either passwords are revealed or items are revealed that could be basis for a plain text attack. When a client attempts to connect to the Remoting connection a challenge is sent back to the client containing a list of supported authentication SASL mechanisms that the client can select from to attempt to authenticate, the client selects on and attempts the authentication.  If authentication succeeds then the client can then request to connect to the service it wished to use, if not the client is re-challenged with the list of mechanisms and this is repeated until the client either successfully authenticates or the list is exhausted. The SASL mechanisms that are offered are selected based on the capabilities of the backing user store - as an example if we have a user store what we can query to obtain the users password or a pre-prepared hash of their password we offer the client the Digest-MD5 mechanism - however if we can only verify a supplied password but not generate the hashes required for Digest based authenitcation then PLAIN is offered as a mechanism. A second SASL mechanism that we also support is the External mechanism, this mechanism is a special mechanism in that it automatically authenticates as an identity associated with the surrounding connection - currently we use this for ClientCert style authentication where after a TLS connection is established authentication will then proceed based on the clients certificate. Another mechanism that we are currently adding support for is GSSAPI, this is a mechanism that authenticates a user by the use of authentication tokens with no exchange of passwords between the points involved in the authentication process. The ability to authenticate using these different approaches where we can reduce the places where either passwords or replayable tokens are visible is the key reason why we do not want to introduce those kind of vulnerabilities in the solution to the two problems being described here. Authentication is only presently performed on establishing the connection and is considered valid for the life of the connection. h4. SASL As described above we are using SASL for the negotiated authentication process between the client and the server, there are a couple of areas of SASL that either we don't use or we only use in a limited way that we can potentially take advantage of for some of this work. h5. Authorization Id For all mechanisms supported by SASL there is both an authentication id and an authorization id in the request. * *authentication id* - This is the ID of the user actually performing the authentication i.e. this is the identity of the user we are comparing the password against. * *authorization id* - This is the identity that we want requests to run as, i.e. this is the identity that we load the roles for. Presently we mandate that both of these identities are the same so whilst users authenticate as themselves they can only request that the requests are run as themselves as well. This now means that for a server account say 'ServerA' we are saying that we know that 'ServerA' has the capability to authenticate the remote users so we can now configure a sub-set of the users that 'ServerA' can now ask that requests are executed on behalf of.  h5. External The external SASL mechanism is a special SASL mechanism that uses something from the connection for the authentication step, presently use this mechanism to authenticate based on the clients certificate after a TLS connection had already been established - we can do this as the TLS negotiation process also went through a verification process using the trust store to verify that the clients certificate is trusted. When looking at the existing connections one area of solutions that will be explored below is to consider repeating the SASL process within an already authenticated connection.  The External mechanism could then have another role to play in that now there is already an authenticated user associated with the connection (for these issues most likey authenticated as a server) - combined with the authorization ID as discussed above a server could authenticate using this mechanism and specify the authorization id without having to repeat the full authentication process that was performed as the connection was established. h5. GSSAPI This one is not a mechanism we are currently using but are close to being able to enable this feature - in short this is enabling Kerberos based authentication which also includes identity propagation capabilities without needing to drop to using the authorization id.  For anyone really serious about security context propagation I would most likely recommend this approach - however this is very dependent on the related infrastructure so may not be a suitable as a one size fits all solution. h5. Callback Handlers Where SASL is used clients are expected to provide a CallbackHandler that will be called by a mechanism to request information that is required to make the call, the idea being that these CallbackHandlers contain no data and pro-actively prompt for these values ony if they are actually required.  Although at some point we would like to review the CallbackHandler API due to some deficiencies in the current API that is not a priority here. h4. Multi Realm Support Presently within JBoss AS7 a single realm is used for the authentication process as the connection is established, there is a desire to support multiple realms however multiple realms on connecting to the server is currently outside the scope of this feature being considered. However if we implement a solution that uses any form of authentication then that solution should allow for the authentication to be against different realms.  The feasibility and details for this should be considered in more depth with the selected solution. h2. Proposed Solutions This section describes the solutions currently considered and where appropriate describes why those solutions are currently discounted, at this point this is intended to be for discussion rather than a final definitive decision. h3. Solution from Previous Releases In previous AS releases unless a custom RMI socket was used the connections to the application server were not authenticated, instead the username and credential would be passed along with the EJB invocation and intercepted before the call reached the EJB - the supplied information would then be used to authenticate the remote user before allowing the call to proceed. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19893/Previous+AS+Calls.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19893/Previous+AS+Calls.png Where a client wanted to run as multiple identities that was fine as for each invocation a different username and password could be set for the call. This approach also potentially allowed for the security context to be passed onto subsequent servers as the contents from this message invocation are available. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19894/Previous+AS+Calls+C--S--S.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19894/Previous+AS+Calls+C--S--S.png Whilst this approach does solve the problem of being able to switch identities and propagate identities it suffers from the problem that the users password is sent in the clear so should we undertake a similar solution for AS7 it would undermine the protection available from the currently available SASL mechanisms, in addition to this it is assuming that a username / password based authentication is always the approach we will want to take even though there are now alternative mechanisms in common use. h3. Reauthenticate The Connection As the calls are executed as the identity of the connection one approach could be to allow the client side to initiate a re-authentication of the connection so that a different identity can be used. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19895/Reauthenticate+Whole+Connection.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19895/Reauthenticate+Whole+Connection.png Whilst this would allow a client to switch identities and it could potentially be implemented using the SASL mechanisms the biggest issue here is if the client is multi-threaded and wants to run as multiple identities concurrently.  At best the client would need to maintain a pool of connections one for each identity in use and if all identities could be used at once then it is no better than the current situation. The multi threaded client issue is also made worse in the server to server case where sharing a single connection would be a major benefit in reducing the resources used. Above where the existing Remoting authentication is described the capabilties relating to the authorization id and the External mechanism are described, for a server to server connection we could use both of these to re-authenticate the connection to switch the authorization id to the id we wish to run as - however in a server to server environment this one identity at a time per connection issue becomes even greater. h3. Authentication On Invocation Moving beyond re-authenticating the whole connection another posibility is to add authentication to the actual invocation, above the previous approach of bundling credentials with an invocation was illustrated but another option now would be to add SASL authentication to the invocation process. For the connection re-authentication of a single client the requests would be intercepted like this: - https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19897/SASL+Per+Request.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19897/SASL+Per+Request.png The authentication could be optional with one of the following being used to enable it for a request: - * A flag from the client indicating that they want the authentication to occur. * A failed authorization check indicating the current client does not have the required permissions so now give them an opportunity to switch to an identity that does. Alternatively it could be mandatory for the request and where no switch is required the client could use the External mechanism to ask that the current invocation is executed as the previously authenticated identity. For the client to server scenario it would be most likely that the client is using the SASL mechanisms that perform a full authentication i.e. one of the username password mechanisms with the client knowing the usernames and password of each of the identities it wishes to use.  However if the authorization ID capability is supported there is nothing to stop clients from using it should their user be allowed to do so. A server to server call would not look like: - https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19898/SASL+Per+Request+C--S--S.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19898/SASL+Per+Request+C--S--S.png The client to server portion of the call is described above but the server to server portion of the call would either be dependent on the authorization id and possibly the External mechanism capabilties or the set up would be using GSSAPI end to end to make use of the propagation capabilities of GSSAPI.  Either way existing connections are now re-used without introducing a serialization of requests over the connections as multiple requests could be executed as different users concurrently. One point to keep in mind is that although the diagram only shows one client calling the first server there could in fact be many clients calling that server each with their own connection to the server and then a single connection between the servers. There are a couple of down sides for this approach. * The additional SASL challenge is deep within the protocol of the service being called, if we wanted to repeat this for further protocols e.g. JNDI, management, JMX etc... then it will need to be implemented again for each of these. * Where on the client side a CallbackHandler may be used to supply credentials to the client side of a selected SASL mechanism - if the authentication is using a one time password the client will be prompted to supply this on each invocation. h3. Authentication Service This solution is to add a new additional service to the server, clients can choose to call this service perform a SASL authentication, recieve a token after authentication is complete and pass this token in subsequent request to ask that the invocation containing the token is executed as the authorization id from the SASL authentication previously completed. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19899/Auth+Service.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19899/Auth+Service.png Within this solution the majority of the new interactions are handled using this new 'Authentication Service' this service is responsible for handling a new SASL authentication process and returning an authentication token to the client.  It is anticipated that a process like this would support all SASL authentication mechanisms currently supported including different authorization IDs and the alternative use of the External mechanism also described above. As in the previous solution it is anticipated that the client would be using mechanism based on having the required information to perform the authentication as different users however it is possible that the client could have the ability to request a different authorization id. A small change is still required for the EJB invocation in that the token needs to be passed with the request, intercepted and the real identity that token maps to retrieved from the Authentication Service. The server to server case then looks like this: - https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/19900/Auth+Service+C--S--S.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/19900/Auth+Service+C--S--S.png For the server to server call as with the previous solution the server could either make use of the External mechanism with a different authorization ID when calling the authentication service or the server could use GSSAPI if it has a forwardable GSSAPI identity - either way the server recieves back a token which it then uses on the EJB invocation. Should other services on the server require the ability for security context propagation then the same service would be used and the only part that would need to be repeated is the passing of this security token. h5. Token Management By introducing a token we do not want to be introducing anything that now can be used in any form of attack based on intercepting these packets, here we have a couple of options: - * Tie the token to the connection, replays over a different connection will be rejected - clients that re-connect will have to re-establish the connections.* This does have an implication if a CallbackHandler is in use on the client, this may be required to cache the username and password whilst being aware of any one time password requriements. * Investigate some form of key exchange for insecure connections so the client and server can generate their own secrets, exchange them and then allow the client to prove that it can legitimatly use the token it supplied.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Web Development] - HTTPS Redirect URL	Problem</header>
    <body>I have HTTP to HTTPS redirect working correctly on our JBOSS 5.0.1 Server by adding the following to web.xml: &lt;security-constraint&gt; &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;       &lt;web-resource-name&gt;Secure Content&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;       &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;       &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;       &lt;user-data-constraint&gt;       &lt;transport-guarantee&gt;CONFIDENTIAL&lt;/transport-guarantee&gt;       &lt;/user-data-constraint&gt; &lt;/security-constraint&gt; The problem is that the URL in the response does not work correctly on all of our user's networks. If I go to  http://example.com/ http://example.com, I get redirected to  https://example.com:7000/ https://example.com:7000 That url does not work for all of our users.

You have two way: 1) You configure the port in Jboss 80 or 443 2) You install Apache and configure mod_jk mod_proxy mod_cluster as load balancing</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - How create a new	deployer?</header>
    <body>Hi All, I would like to create a new deployer for the following use case: I would like to create a file, preferably an XML file, which contains a "bundle name" (not to confuse with OSGi bundles, though), and a list of JAR's, WAR's, or EAR's that should be deployed. All those artifacts to be deployed should be specified by a URI, e.g. "file:/home/myname/deployments/my-new-app-1.0.0.jar" or "mvn:org.mydomain.app/myapp/1.0.0/war". The file should then be picked up by my new deployer and then the list of all those artifacts should be resolved (found) according to the URI. Here is my question: Are there any HOWTO's, examples, or other documentation that describes how to implement a new deployer in JBoss AS7? It would even be helpful if someone could point me to some existing implementations? I looked at the current source and tried to figure out how the deployer for the "*-ds.xml" files was implemented, but it is hard for me to see how this would be hooked into the overall JBoss deployment subsystem? Any help or pointers would be much appreciated.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - writing own standalone module that needs legacy log4j support</header>
    <body>This is yet another log4j thread - however, I think its different than most that have been posted - at least I can't find the answer to my specific use case - so don't roll your eyes just yet  :) I am not writing an EAR, WAR, whatever. I am writing a standalone module (it has a Main-Class in it - its just like what the org.jboss.as.cli module does) and I am deploying it as just a module. I start the server via something like "java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp &lt;module paths&gt; org.my.module" (this is similar to how the jboss CLI script starts the CLI) However, my module code is using some legacy libraries that use both commons-logging with log4j underneath (there is a log4j.xml that I want to be used to configure the logging). I do NOT get any ClassNotFound or similar errors, the code runs "ok" - only, I do not see any of log messages coming out in the console or the file (I have both appenders defined in log4j.xml). In my modules.xml, I do have a dependency on modules org.apache.commons.logging, org.apache.log4j, org.jboss.logmanager and org.jboss.logging. My module does NOT have any of those jars inside of it (that is, my module does not contain the log4j.jar or the commons-logging.jar - since I have a dependency declared for them, I did not put them in my module). Does this make sense? Any ideas on how I get this to work?  Oh, and where exactly is log4j getting is configuration if not from my module's own logj4.xml?</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: writing own standalone module that needs legacy log4j support</header>
    <body>My guess is that the log4j.xml isn't being picked up. Where exactly is that located? Adding -Dlog4j.debug=true system property while starting the server might help in understanding that (you'll see the system.out messages from log4j, telling you what it's upto).</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: writing own standalone module that needs legacy log4j support</header>
    <body>You'll need to do a Couple Things to make it work.  Our log4j is modified for the purpose of forwarding through the LogManager.  So step one is, you'll have to make sure your module has a dependency on "org.jboss.logmanager" with 'services="import"' set. Next, I believe you'll have to configure a LogManager-style logging.properties in your module as our log4j won't be configuring itself.  Once you do these things you *should* get some output.</body>

  <mail>
    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: writing own standalone module that needs legacy log4j support</header>
    <body>Thanks folks. So, I got it to work by adding the org.jboss.logmanager with services=import in modules.xml and I put a logging.properties file in the root directory of my module's main jar file. I did do both of those before, but not at the same time which is why it wasn't working for me :-) So, making sure I do both of those fixed the problem. Note that having a log4j.xml doesn't matter - I don't have a log4j.xml and things still worked.</body>

It is not possible to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, +mvn verify+ is to be prefered to +mvn install+. However, if you want to build stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use +mvn install+. In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if your use-case requires it. h2. About Target Platform and related profiles The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from this TP are allowed to be used in code. If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&amp;summary=Add%20[YOUR%20REQ]%20to%20Target%20Platform&amp;components=12310540&amp;issuetype=13&amp;Create=Create open a ticket to request it. Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's up to you to choose the one that match your needs: h3. Using published Target Platform definition (Recommanded) unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target Platfrom repository. * Pros:* No additional thing to do than invoking Maven * Always up-to-date * Cons: Speed - (to evaluate) Consume it by adding* +-Punified.target+* to you Maven invocation command-line h3. Or, getting a local copy of the Target Platform * Pros: Speed +++ * Cons: Step to be repeated whenever  https://source.jboss.org/browse/JBossTools/trunk/build/target-platform/unified.target target platform changes h4. Set up h5.  Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder on your disk. For convenience, the easiest is to unzip into jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/, since that's where the Maven or Ant process will by default operate. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/target-platform_3.3.indigo.SR2/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/target-platform_3.3.indigo.SR2/+*&lt;actualFilename&gt;*+.target.zip and then unzip it here (the default path for -Dlocal.site, which means you can call maven with +*-Plocal.site*+ and not need to pass in +*-Dlocal.site=file:///path/to/some/other/folder/*+ as well): unzip *.target.zip -d jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/ *(Note that the default path used for &lt;local.site&gt; will change every time a new target platform is released which is a significant change over the previous (eg., SR1, SR2), so if this breaks because the default not points at an empty folder, it's time to get a new TP! Hurray for build-time notification you're using an old target platform!)* h5. OR, use Maven+Ant to get it In that case, you also need Ant 1.8.2 or later*.* cd jbosstools/build/target-platform mvn clean install -Pget.local.target The get.local.target profile will resolve the target platform file, multiple.target, as a p2 repository on your local disk in ~/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/. It may take a while, so you're better off from a speed point-of-view simply fetching the latest zip [5]. However, if you want to see what actually happens to create the TP (as done in Hudson) this is the approach to take. Since the Maven profile is simply a wrapper call to Ant, you can also use Ant 1.8 or later directly: cd jbosstools/build/target-platform ant help # show usage instructions h4. Use Just add -*P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///path/to/target/repository/* *NOTE:* You must specify a path starting with *file:///* (three or more slashes) to avoid errors such as "+p2.core.ProvisionException URI has an authority component+". Examples *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site *-Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/* &gt; build.all.log.txt h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platform and want to test it locally. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. This is only necessary when the TP change, prior to 3.3.Beta3 svn co http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk jbosstools cd jbosstools/build/parent mvn clean install ... [INFO] Reactor Summary: [INFO] [INFO] JBoss Tools Target Platform Definition ............ SUCCESS [0.724s] [INFO] JBoss Tools Parent ................................ SUCCESS [0.461s] ... *NOTE: You need not fetch the entire JBoss Tools tree from SVN (or Git (http://divby0.blogspot.com/2011/01/howto-partially-clone-svn-repo-to-git.html)).* *Instead, you can just fetch the build/ folder and one or more component folders, then as before,* *build the parent pom. After that, go into the component folder and run maven there (#runmavenpercomponent).* mkdir jbosstools cd jbosstools svn co  http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/ http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build svn co  http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/ http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/jmx cd jbosstools/build/parent mvn clean install ...

Building Individual Components Locally Via Commandline h3. Build a component resolving to a recent aggregation build for other JBT dependencies (Recommanded) * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * Speed to resolve deps: + * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons:* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change. More risk to get out of sync than with the staging site. Tracked by  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 example: *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-staging-aggregate* h3. Build a component resolving to the latest CI builds for other JBT dependencies * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change * Speed to resolve deps: - This profile is the one use for CI builds on Hudson. *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-nightly-staging-composite* h3. Build a component along with all its dependencies from sources ("bootstrap" build) This will build exactly what you have locally * Pros:* You are sure of the version of sources that is used for your JBT dependencies * You don't loose time in resolving your JBT deps * Cons:* You need sources for your dependencies too * You often build more stuff that what you really want to test cd ~/trunk/build mvn verify  -P unified.target -*P jmx-bootstrap* h2. Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean verify -P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/    or mvn3 clean verify  -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/ &gt; build.all.log.txt If you downloaded the zip and unpacked is somewhere else, use -Dlocal.site=file:///.../ to point at that folder instead h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-61-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-61-13876/310-276/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-61-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-61-13877/450-259/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: +clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file://home/nboldt/tmp/JBT_REPO_Indigo/+ Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-61-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-61-13878/450-540/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-61-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-61-13879/450-538/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-61-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-61-13880/450-539/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-61-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-61-13881/450-542/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-61-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-61-13882/450-347/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/runtime.site.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., Runtime Detection depends on JBoss Common, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during indigo builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

For convenience, the easiest is to unzip into jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/, since that's where the Maven or Ant process will by default operate. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url:      http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/e420-wtp340.target.zip e420-wtp340.target.zip (current minimum TP)      http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/e421-wtp341.target.zip e421-wtp341.target.zip (current maximum TP) and then unzip it : unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/my jbosstools/build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR0c/local/target/REPO/   or unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/my jbosstools/build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR1a/local/target/REPO/ *(Note that the default path used for &lt;local.site&gt; will change every time a new target platform is released which is a significant change over the previous (eg., SR1, SR2), so if this breaks because the default not points at an empty folder, it's time to get a new TP! Hurray for build-time notification you're using an old target platform!)* h5. OR, use Maven to get it Starting from jbosstools-builds: cd target-platforms/&lt;choose_a_target_to_build&gt;/multiple mvn install By default, a Maven profile +multiple2repo+ is enabled. You can see the result repo in target/multiple.target.repo. This output repo can be used as a mirror for unified.target. It may take a while, so you're better off from a speed point-of-view simply fetching the latest zip [5]. However, if you want to see what actually happens to create the TP (as done in Hudson) this is the approach to take. h4. Use it as Maven mirror Once you get the target platform available locally, you can use it instead of the remote sites to save time. For this, we can simply use Tycho target-platform mirroring:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors As example, you can simply edit to your ~/.m2/settings.xml the definition of the repositories to mirror: (replace /ho,e/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/.... by a path where your local repository actuaaly stands) &lt;settings&gt;      &lt;mirrors&gt; &lt;!-- IMPORTANT: Sites in target platforms: must not have trailing slash! --&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/e420-wtp340.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/e421-wtp341.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/jbds600-e420-wtp340.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/jbds600-e421-wtp341.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;     &lt;/mirrors&gt; &lt;/settings&gt; h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platform and want to test it locally. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. This is only necessary when the TP change, prior to 3.3.Beta3 svn co http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk jbosstools cd jbosstools/build/parent mvn clean install ...

Building Individual Components Locally Via Commandline h3. Build a component resolving to a recent aggregation build for other JBT dependencies (Recommanded) * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * Speed to resolve deps: + * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons:* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change. More risk to get out of sync than with the staging site. Tracked by  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 example: *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-staging-aggregate* h3. Build a component resolving to the latest CI builds for other JBT dependencies * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change * Speed to resolve deps: - This profile is the one use for CI builds on Hudson. *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-nightly-staging-composite* h3. Build a component along with all its dependencies from sources ("bootstrap" build) This will build exactly what you have locally * Pros:* You are sure of the version of sources that is used for your JBT dependencies * You don't loose time in resolving your JBT deps * Cons:* You need sources for your dependencies too * You often build more stuff that what you really want to test cd ~/trunk/build mvn verify  -P unified.target -*P jmx-bootstrap* h2. Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean verify -P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/    or mvn3 clean verify  -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/ &gt; build.all.log.txt If you downloaded the zip and unpacked is somewhere else, use -Dlocal.site=file:///.../ to point at that folder instead h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13876/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13877/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: +clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file://home/nboldt/tmp/JBT_REPO_Indigo/+ Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13878/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13879/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13880/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13881/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13882/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/runtime.site.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., Runtime Detection depends on JBoss Common, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. Dealing with timeouts for tests (To be rewritten soon...)  http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during indigo builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

To work around this, just build them locally: cd /tmp; svn co http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/ mvn install -U -f build/parent/pom.xml mvn install -U -f build/tycho-plugins/pom.xml mvn install -U -f build/target-platforms/pom.xml -Pjbosstools-maximum,jbosstools-minimum h3. Maven &amp; Java Memory Configuration To configure the amount of memory used by Maven, you can define MVN_OPTS as follows, either in the mvn / mvn.bat script you use to run Maven, or set as global environment variables. Here's how to do so for  http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=262465 Fedora,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables Ubuntu,  http://forums.techarena.in/windows-xp-support/1152405.htm Windows,  http://www.digitaledgesw.com/node/31 OSX. set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m h2. Verify or Install ? +mvn verify+ will perform all build and test steps, but it won't install the bundles in your local repository. +mvn install+ does install in you local repository. When an eclipse-plugin is installed in your repo, it is always used as default when resolving dependency. It is not possible to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, +mvn verify+ is to be prefered to +mvn install+. However, if you want to build stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use +mvn install+. In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if your use-case requires it. h2. About Target Platform and related profiles The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from this TP are allowed to be used in code. If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&amp;summary=Add%20[YOUR%20REQ]%20to%20Target%20Platform&amp;components=12310540&amp;issuetype=13&amp;Create=Create open a ticket to request it. Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's up to you to choose the one that match your needs: h3. Using published Target Platform definition (Recommanded) unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target Platfrom repository. * Pros:* No additional thing to do than invoking Maven * Always up-to-date * Cons: Speed - (to evaluate) Consume it by adding* +-Punified.target+* to you Maven invocation command-line h3. Or, getting a local copy of the Target Platform * Pros: Speed +++ * Cons: Step to be repeated whenever  https://source.jboss.org/browse/JBossTools/trunk/build/target-platform/unified.target target platform changes h4. Get it h5.  Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder on your disk. Just remember to update your  #settings.xml settings.xml file to point at the location where you unpacked it. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url:      http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/e420-wtp340.target.zip e420-wtp340.target.zip (current minimum TP)      http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/e421-wtp341.target.zip e421-wtp341.target.zip (current maximum TP) and then unzip it : unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/jbosstools-build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR0c/multiple/target/multiple.target.repo/   or unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/jbosstools-build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR1a/multiple/target/multiple.target.repo/ h5. OR, use Maven to build it Starting from  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build/ jbosstools-build: cd target-platforms/&lt;choose_a_target_to_build&gt;/multiple mvn install By default, a Maven profile +multiple2repo+ is enabled. You can see the result repo in +target/multiple.target.repo+. This output repo can be used as a mirror for unified.target. It may take a while, so you're better off from a speed point-of-view simply fetching the latest zip [5]. However, if you want to see what actually happens to create the TP (as done in Hudson) this is the approach to take. # h4. Use it as a Maven mirror Once you get the target platform available locally, you can use it instead of the remote sites to save time. For this, we can simply use Tycho target-platform mirroring:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors As example, you can simply edit to your ~/.m2/settings.xml the definition of the repositories to mirror: (replace /home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/.... by a path where your local repository actuaaly stands) &lt;settings&gt;      &lt;mirrors&gt; &lt;!-- IMPORTANT: Sites in target platforms: must not have trailing slash! --&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/e420-wtp340.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/e421-wtp341.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/jbds600-e420-wtp340.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/jbds600-e421-wtp341.target&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;     &lt;/mirrors&gt; &lt;/settings&gt; h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platform and want to test it locally. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. This is only necessary when the TP change, prior to 3.3.Beta3 svn co http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk jbosstools cd jbosstools-build/parent mvn clean install ... [INFO] Reactor Summary: [INFO] [INFO] JBoss Tools Target Platform Definition ............ SUCCESS [0.724s] [INFO] JBoss Tools Parent ................................

After that, go into the component folder and run maven there (#runmavenpercomponent).* mkdir jbosstools cd jbosstools svn co  http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/ http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build svn co  http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/ http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/jmx cd jbosstools-build/parent mvn clean install ...

Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd jbosstools-build mvn clean install -gs ~/.m2/settings.xml | tee build.all.log.txt (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\jbosstools-build    or Remember to adjust your  #settings.xml settings.xml file to specify where you have your local target platform mirror built (or where you downloaded &amp; unpacked a target platform zip. Windows users, if you don't have a .m2 folder, see  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081617/missing-maven-m2-folder this article. h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13876/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13877/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: +clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file://home/nboldt/tmp/JBT_REPO_Indigo/+ Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13878/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13879/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13880/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13881/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13882/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/runtime.site.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., Runtime Detection depends on JBoss Common, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. Dealing with timeouts for tests (To be rewritten soon...)  http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during indigo builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

For this, we can simply use Tycho target-platform mirroring:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors As example, you can simply edit to your ~/.m2/settings.xml the definition of the repositories to mirror: (replace /home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/.... by a path where your local repository actuaaly stands) &lt;settings&gt;      &lt;mirrors&gt; &lt;!-- IMPORTANT: Sites in target platforms: must not have trailing slash! --&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt; http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/REPO http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/e420-wtp340.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt; http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/REPO http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/e421-wtp341.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt; http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/REPO http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/jbds600-e420-wtp340.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt; http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/REPO http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/jbds600-e421-wtp341.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;     &lt;/mirrors&gt; &lt;/settings&gt; h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platforms and want to test local changes. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP definitions from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. See  #maven-nexus-resolution-problems Building Parent Pom &amp; Target Platforms Locally h2. Building Individual Components Locally Via Commandline h3.

Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd jbosstools-build mvn clean install -gs ~/.m2/settings.xml | tee build.all.log.txt (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\jbosstools-build    or Remember to adjust your  #settings.xml settings.xml file to specify where you have your local target platform mirror built (or where you downloaded &amp; unpacked a target platform zip. Windows users, if you don't have a .m2 folder, see  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081617/missing-maven-m2-folder this article. h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13876/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13877/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: +clean install -B -fae -e+ Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13878/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13879/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13880/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13881/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-62-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-62-13882/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools-server/site/target/server.site-*.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools-server/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., jbosstools-server depends on jbosstools-base, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. Dealing with timeouts for tests (To be rewritten soon...)  http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during indigo builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf +</body>

Maven &amp; Java Memory Configuration To configure the amount of memory used by Maven, you can define MVN_OPTS as follows, either in the mvn / mvn.bat script you use to run Maven, or set as global environment variables. Here's how to do so for  http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=262465 Fedora,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables Ubuntu,  http://forums.techarena.in/windows-xp-support/1152405.htm Windows,  http://www.digitaledgesw.com/node/31 OSX. set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m h2. Verify or Install ? +mvn verify+ will perform all build and test steps, but it won't install the bundles in your local repository. +mvn install+ does install in you local repository. When an eclipse-plugin is installed in your repo, it is always used as default when resolving dependency. It is not possible to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, +mvn verify+ is to be prefered to +mvn install+. However, if you want to build stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use +mvn install+. In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if your use-case requires it. h2. About Target Platform and related profiles The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from this TP are allowed to be used in code. If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&amp;summary=Add%20[YOUR%20REQ]%20to%20Target%20Platform&amp;components=12310540&amp;issuetype=13&amp;Create=Create open a ticket to request it. Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's up to you to choose the one that match your needs: h3. Using published Target Platform definition (Recommanded) unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target Platfrom repository. * Pros:* No additional thing to do than invoking Maven * Always up-to-date * Cons: Speed - (to evaluate) Consume it by adding* +-Punified.target+* to you Maven invocation command-line h3. Or, getting a local copy of the Target Platform * Pros: Speed +++ * Cons: Step to be repeated whenever  https://source.jboss.org/browse/JBossTools/trunk/build/target-platform/unified.target target platform changes h4. Set up h5.  Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder on your disk. For convenience, the easiest is to unzip into jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/, since that's where the Maven or Ant process will by default operate. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/target-platform_3.3.indigo.SR2/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/target-platform_3.3.indigo.SR2/+*&lt;actualFilename&gt;*+.target.zip and then unzip it here (the default path for -Dlocal.site, which means you can call maven with +*-Plocal.site*+ and not need to pass in +*-Dlocal.site=file:///path/to/some/other/folder/*+ as well): unzip *.target.zip -d jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/ *(Note that the default path used for &lt;local.site&gt; will change every time a new target platform is released which is a significant change over the previous (eg., SR1, SR2), so if this breaks because the default not points at an empty folder, it's time to get a new TP! Hurray for build-time notification you're using an old target platform!)* h5. OR, use Maven+Ant to get it In that case, you also need Ant 1.8.2 or later*.* cd jbosstools/build/target-platform mvn clean install -Pget.local.target The get.local.target profile will resolve the target platform file, multiple.target, as a p2 repository on your local disk in ~/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/. It may take a while, so you're better off from a speed point-of-view simply fetching the latest zip [5]. However, if you want to see what actually happens to create the TP (as done in Hudson) this is the approach to take. Since the Maven profile is simply a wrapper call to Ant, you can also use Ant 1.8 or later directly: cd jbosstools/build/target-platform ant help # show usage instructions h4. Use Just add -*P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///path/to/target/repository/* *NOTE:* You must specify a path starting with *file:///* (three or more slashes) to avoid errors such as "+p2.core.ProvisionException URI has an authority component+". Examples *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site *-Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/* &gt; build.all.log.txt h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platform and want to test it locally. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. This is only necessary when the TP change, prior to 3.3.Beta3 svn co http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk jbosstools cd jbosstools/build/parent mvn clean install ... [INFO] Reactor Summary: [INFO] [INFO] JBoss Tools Target Platform Definition ............ SUCCESS [0.724s] [INFO] JBoss Tools Parent ................................

Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13876/310-276/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13877/450-259/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: +clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file://home/nboldt/tmp/JBT_REPO_Indigo/+ Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13878/450-540/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13879/450-538/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13880/450-539/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13881/450-542/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13882/450-347/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/runtime.site.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., Runtime Detection depends on JBoss Common, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during indigo builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Bumping slf4j version?</header>
    <body>Hello, I noticed that AS7 7.1.1-final ships with a slf4j 1.6.1 module. There are some bugfix upgrades in the 1.6.x branch, so I wonder if you would consider bumping this version - at least for the 7.2 or next. I do know that this version is pretty independend from deployed bundles, deployments or modules but it would be good to have a on-default current environemnt. With that in mind, the 1.7.x is supposed to be API compatible but adds the additional compile feature for variable argument lists. So I would like to see a 1.7.x slf4j-api dependency in the modules especially since it makes less dependency differences for users wanting to compile explicitely for AS7 environemnt.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: ClientLoginModule	support</header>
    <body>Tarek, you have raised 2 questions/issues here: 1) How to use ClientLoginModule on the remote client side to propagate a client side JAAS login information to the server during connection authentication 2) Once a remote connection has been established with the server using a specific credential, how to switch the credential on that remote connection, for subsequent usages of that connection. #2 is currently not possible and that's what Darran meant when he said work is in progress to try and support it. However, if you are looking for an example on how to do #1 then I just added an example to the quickstart guides here  https://github.com/jaikiran/quickstart/tree/client-login-module/ejb-remote https://github.com/jaikiran/quickstart/tree/client-login-module/ejb-remote. You can run that quickstart to see it working. But you can even read the javadoc on this class and the referenced classes to understand how it all works  https://github.com/jaikiran/quickstart/blob/client-login-module/ejb-remote/client/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/ejb/remote/client/callbackhandler/CustomServerLoginHandshakeCallbackHandler.java#L40 https://github.com/jaikiran/quickstart/blob/client-login-module/ejb-remote/client/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/ejb/remote/client/callbackhandler/CustomServerLoginHandshakeCallbackHandler.java#L40. I won't be able to write up an article on this today but plan to do soon. But I guess, those javadoc should give you can idea of how it can be achieved. If you have further questions, feel free to ask.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: ClientLoginModule	support</header>
    <body>Hi Jaikiran, I kind of worked around 1 but with a serious kludge which involved caching various InitialContexts based on credentials. Your method is most definitley more elegant. Thank you for putting the time in this. One thought that kept coming back is with the whole notion of "fixing" the credentials at connection establishment time and effectively do away with credential propogation at call time. I do see why to a certain extent and reworked our code to work with this model. You guys truly do a fantastic job. Please keep it up.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>I've been thinking about giving some history to the user to know how patching affected its installation. The most essential info is to let him know which patches have been applied and when. When a patch is applied to the installation, I store a timestamp file in the .metadata/history/patchX. When the user query the system, we look at the patch info service, fill the history for the CP (if it applies) and the previous CPs and one-offs (if it applies). Thinking about this raises some questions about patches metadata. Can we apply multiple CP one after the othe (e.g. CP for 6.0.1-&gt;6.0.2 then CP for 6.0.2-&gt;6.0.5) or can we apply only 1 CP per installation? It's my understanding that applying a CP invalidates all the applied one-offs but I can not find this stated anywhere, am I mistaken? If one-offs can only have been applied to the current CP (or the base version)., that means that in the history, only CPs have a cumulative file containing the *previous cumulative* (renaming the file to previous-cumulative makes it simpler to understand) I've come up with a simple concrete example where: - a base version has been installed - CP patch-00-CP has been applied - CP patch-01-CP has been applied - one-off patch-XX-oneoff has been applied - one-off patch-YY-oneoff has been applied we end up with the following directory layout: patches/ |-- patch-00-CP |   |-- bundles |   `-- modules |-- patch-01-CP |   |-- bundles |   `-- modules |-- patch-XX-oneoff |   |-- bundles |    `-- modules |-- patch-YY-oneoff |   |-- bundles |    `-- modules `-- .metadata     |-- cumulative (file content =&gt; 'patch-01-CP')     |-- references     |   `-- patch-01-CP (file content =&gt; [patch-01, patch-02])     `-- history         |-- patch-00-CP         |   |-- timestamp         |   `-- misc (patch' "root" for misc content)         |     `-- bin         |          ` standalone.sh (file backup)         |-- patch-01-CP         |   |-- previous-cumulative         |   |-- timestamp         |   `-- misc         |-- patch-XX-oneoff         |   |-- timestamp         |   `-- misc         `-- patch-YY-oneoff             |-- timestamp             `-- misc * .metadata/cumulative file correspond to the current cumulative version. If no CP have been applied (the installation is at its base version), this file does not exist. * history/patch-00-CP has not previous-cumulative since it's been applied to base version * .metadata/references/XXX files correspond to a given cumulative version and contains a list of the patches that have been applied on top of the CP (one per line) * history/XXX/timestamp file contains a ISO-8601 data corresponding to the time the patch has been applied. * history/XXX/misc is the "root" directory for backup of modified/removed misc content To build the history, we have to browse: 1) the .metadata/cumulative &amp; history/XXX/previous-cumulative to build the successive CP (if more than one can be applied) 2) the references/XXX of the current cumulative to have the history of the one-off applied patches I also have a question about rollback. From the spec, I understand we want to rollback to a previous point in history. But we will not provide a way to rollback a given patch. Is that correct?</body>

    <body>h3. Project Information | - Roadmap (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7/component/12313823) - Issue Tracking (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7) - Source Code:      - Authoritative master: https://github.com/jbossas/console      - Most recent: https://github.com/jbossas/console/tree/develop - Hacking the Codebase (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16607) - Releases (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47610) If you are looking for stable build, then you should consider the jbossas/console repository. Current development however, takes place on the "develop" branch. Stable milestones will be merged onto "master" with every release. | Jenkins:  https://hudson.jboss.org/hudson/job/AS7ManagementConsole/lastBuild/buildStatus  (https://hudson.jboss.org/hudson/job/AS7ManagementConsole/lastBuild/) | h2. Extension Mechanism In relation to  http://hbraun.info/2012/09/web-console-architecture-future-directions/ http://hbraun.info/2012/09/web-console-architecture-future-directions/ * GWT Composition Build time, lowest common denominator, based on building blocks but manual plumbing We have an example of this mechanism implemented already:  https://github.com/heiko-braun/composite-ui https://github.com/heiko-braun/composite-ui * Plugin descriptiors Abstract model, relies on fixed schema (DMR metadata+UI properties), fixed set of supported traits, can be consumed by many clients * Runtime extensions Applicable to both options above. Removes compile time dependecy. h3. Layered Projects Some projects already integrate/extend the AS7 console. || *Project Name* || *Repository* || *Status* || | Switchyard | https://github.com/rcernich/jbossas-console/tree/master-hbraun | Does build on a previous version. Should update to &gt;1.5.0 | | Teiid | https://github.com/teiid/teiid-web-console | Implements the most current version (1.5.0-SNAPSHOT) | | | | | h2. UI design &amp; Interaction Patterns General UI design issues and ideas are collected here. h2. Requirements, Ideas, Nice-to-Have || || *Desc* || | C0100 | The UI must be able to dynamically render model elements based solely upon its predefined description (the description may (and probably often will) include UI-specific elements to give "hints" to the renderer; i.e. 0 lines of XHTML is better than 10) (note that AS8 descriptions are likely to be more robust and easier to produce than AS7) | | C0200 | The UI must provide (or work with) a mechanism by which multi-step tasks (so-called "wizards") can be defined and subsequently rendered for specific model element types, such that these operations may be automatically associated with their corresponding model elements (even better if the task metadata were reusable by other tools e.g. CLI) | | C0300 | Using these tools it should be possible to generate UIs on many platforms (GWT, Swing, iOS/Android, maybe JON, maybe third-party mgmt tools, ???) which all look, act, and "feel" as similar as possible | | C0350 | RHQ/JON upstream.

See+  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-13341 Building JBoss Tools Documentation.* h2. Environment Setup h3. Prerequisistes 1. Java 1.6 SDK 2. Maven 3.0.3 3. About 6 GB of free disk space if you want to run all integration tests for (JBoss AS, Seam and Web Services Tools) - *requires VPN access* 4. subversion client 1.6.X  (should work with lower version as well, but newer versions may not work as expected) h3. Maven and Java Make sure your maven 3 is available by default and Java 1.6 is used. mvn -version should  print out something like *Apache Maven 3.0.3* (r1075438; 2011-02-28 12:31:09-0500) *Java version: 1.6.0_25*, vendor: Sun Microsystems Inc. *Java home: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_25/jre* Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8 OS name: "linux", version: "2.6.42.3-2.fc15.x86_64", arch: "amd64", family: "unix" h3. Maven settings Follow https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15170  these instructions to add reference to JBoss Repositories into your settings.xml. You'll also probably need access to the SNAPSHOT repository. So here is what you should see in your ~/.m2/settings.xml *What if Maven can't find the upstream artifacts in Nexus?* Sometimes, Maven can't find the upstream artifacts - parent pom, tycho plugins, minimum (Juno SR0) or maximum (Juno SR1 or later) target platforms. To work around this, just build them locally: cd /tmp; svn co  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/ mvn install -U -f build/parent/pom.xml mvn install -U -f build/tycho-plugins/pom.xml mvn install -U -f build/target-platforms/pom.xml -Pjbosstools-maximum,jbosstools-minimum h3. Maven &amp; Java Memory Configuration To configure the amount of memory used by Maven, you can define MVN_OPTS as follows, either in the mvn / mvn.bat script you use to run Maven, or set as global environment variables. Here's how to do so for  http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=262465 Fedora,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables Ubuntu,  http://forums.techarena.in/windows-xp-support/1152405.htm Windows,  http://www.digitaledgesw.com/node/31 OSX. set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m h2. Verify or Install ? +mvn verify+ will perform all build and test steps, but it won't install the bundles in your local repository. +mvn install+ does install in you local repository. When an eclipse-plugin is installed in your repo, it is always used as default when resolving dependency. It is not possible to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, +mvn verify+ is to be prefered to +mvn install+. However, if you want to build stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use +mvn install+. In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if your use-case requires it. h2. About Target Platform and related profiles The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from this TP are allowed to be used in code. If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&amp;summary=Add%20[YOUR%20REQ]%20to%20Target%20Platform&amp;components=12310540&amp;issuetype=13&amp;Create=Create open a ticket to request it. Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's up to you to choose the one that match your needs: h3. Using published Target Platform definition (Recommanded) unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target Platfrom repository. * Pros:* No additional thing to do than invoking Maven * Always up-to-date * Cons: Speed - (to evaluate) Consume it by adding* +-Punified.target+* to you Maven invocation command-line h3. Or, getting a local copy of the Target Platform * Pros: Speed +++ * Cons: Step to be repeated whenever  https://source.jboss.org/browse/JBossTools/trunk/build/target-platform/unified.target target platform changes h4. Set up h5.  Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder on your disk. For convenience, the easiest is to unzip into jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/, since that's where the Maven or Ant process will by default operate. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/target-platform_3.3.indigo.SR2/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/target-platform_3.3.indigo.SR2/+*&lt;actualFilename&gt;*+.target.zip and then unzip it here (the default path for -Dlocal.site, which means you can call maven with +*-Plocal.site*+ and not need to pass in +*-Dlocal.site=file:///path/to/some/other/folder/*+ as well): unzip *.target.zip -d jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/ *(Note that the default path used for &lt;local.site&gt; will change every time a new target platform is released which is a significant change over the previous (eg., SR1, SR2), so if this breaks because the default not points at an empty folder, it's time to get a new TP! Hurray for build-time notification you're using an old target platform!)* h5. OR, use Maven+Ant to get it In that case, you also need Ant 1.8.2 or later*.* cd jbosstools/build/target-platform mvn clean install -Pget.local.target The get.local.target profile will resolve the target platform file, multiple.target, as a p2 repository on your local disk in ~/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/. It may take a while, so you're better off from a speed point-of-view simply fetching the latest zip [5]. However, if you want to see what actually happens to create the TP (as done in Hudson) this is the approach to take. Since the Maven profile is simply a wrapper call to Ant, you can also use Ant 1.8 or later directly: cd jbosstools/build/target-platform ant help # show usage instructions h4. Use Just add -*P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///path/to/target/repository/* *NOTE:* You must specify a path starting with *file:///* (three or more slashes) to avoid errors such as "+p2.core.ProvisionException URI has an authority component+". Examples *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site *-Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/* &gt; build.all.log.txt h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platform and want to test it locally. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. This is only necessary when the TP change, prior to 3.3.Beta3 svn co http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk jbosstools cd jbosstools/build/parent mvn clean install ... [INFO] Reactor Summary: [INFO] [INFO] JBoss Tools Target Platform Definition ............ SUCCESS [0.724s] [INFO] JBoss Tools Parent ................................ SUCCESS [0.461s] ... *NOTE: You need not fetch the entire JBoss Tools tree from SVN (or Git (http://divby0.blogspot.com/2011/01/howto-partially-clone-svn-repo-to-git.html)).* *Instead, you can just fetch the build/ folder and one or more component folders, then as before,* *build the parent pom. After that, go into the component folder and run maven there (#runmavenpercomponent).* mkdir jbosstools cd jbosstools svn co  http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/ http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build svn co  http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/ http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/jmx cd jbosstools/build/parent mvn clean install ...

Building Individual Components Locally Via Commandline h3. Build a component resolving to a recent aggregation build for other JBT dependencies (Recommanded) * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * Speed to resolve deps: + * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons:* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change. More risk to get out of sync than with the staging site. Tracked by  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 example: *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-staging-aggregate* h3. Build a component resolving to the latest CI builds for other JBT dependencies * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change * Speed to resolve deps: - This profile is the one use for CI builds on Hudson. *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-nightly-staging-composite* h3. Build a component along with all its dependencies from sources ("bootstrap" build) This will build exactly what you have locally * Pros:* You are sure of the version of sources that is used for your JBT dependencies * You don't loose time in resolving your JBT deps * Cons:* You need sources for your dependencies too * You often build more stuff that what you really want to test cd ~/trunk/build mvn verify  -P unified.target -*P jmx-bootstrap* h2. Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean verify -P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/    or mvn3 clean verify  -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/ &gt; build.all.log.txt If you downloaded the zip and unpacked is somewhere else, use -Dlocal.site=file:///.../ to point at that folder instead h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-53-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-53-13876/310-276/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-53-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-53-13877/450-259/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: +clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file://home/nboldt/tmp/JBT_REPO_Indigo/+ Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-53-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-53-13878/450-540/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-53-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-53-13879/450-538/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-53-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-53-13880/450-539/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-53-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-53-13881/450-542/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-53-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-53-13882/450-347/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/runtime.site.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., Runtime Detection depends on JBoss Common, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. Dealing with timeouts for tests (To be rewritten soon...)  http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during indigo builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>Multiple CPs can be applied one after another. This would be a typical progression for a long lasting installation, e.g. start with EAP 6.1.0 then apply 6.1.1 then later 6.2.0, then later 6.2.1 etc. Technically, a patch could be generated that takes the installation all the way from 6.1.0 to 6.2.1, but whether that would be done for any particular release combination is up to the folks creating and distributing patches. Yes, applying a CP invalidates all the applied one-offs. What's in thie previous-cumulative file?   Just the name of the applied to version? I think we are going to need to store the patch.xml, which contains that information plus much more. That or something similar. For sure we are going to need to store the hashes of any files changed in a one-off patch, plus data about any misc file changes that the user elected not to have applied. We'll need this information for when we apply a CP on top of a one-off patch. The CP will include existing-hash data for the *base version* against which it was built, but when we check for modifications (i.e. conflicts) we will need to compare against what was in the one-off patch. In that case the existing-hash data in the patch.xml file will not be the relevant hash; the tool will need figure out from the patch history what the expected existing-hash is for what's actually installed. I regard being able to roll back XX but not YY as being a nice to have, but not a requirement, particularly for this first version. However, I'd like us to consider how to do it and try to design for it, even if we don't in the end formally support it. My instinct is that an algorithm that can take the patch content, the history, the current installation, and arguments from the user declaring how to handle conflicts and use that data to figure out what to do with each file in the installation -- that would be the most robust algorithm, the one less likely to have big "oops" holes in it that we'd discover later.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Design of AS7	multi-JSF feature</header>
    <body>*About multi-JSF* Currently, AS7 ships with two JSF implementations, a JSF 2.1 implementation and a JSF 1.2 implementation.  A web application can select which implementation is used by including a context param in web.xml.  By default, it uses the JSF 2.1 imlementation. "multi-JSF" allows installation of multiple JSF implementations (and versions) on the same AS7 server.  The goal is to allow use of any JSF implementation (MyFaces or Mojarra) and any version of those implementation from JSF 1.1 all the way up to the experimental JSF 2.2 versions.  This is far superior to the old WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL method because JSF jars do not need to be bundled with the webapp.  More importantly, "multi-JSF" provides an implementation that is fully integrated with the container.  This means more efficient annotation processing, lifecycle handling, and other integration advantages. *How it works* The way multi-JSF will work is that for each JSF version, a new slot is created in the modules path under *com.sun.jsf-impl*, *javax.faces.api*, and *org.jboss.as.jsf-injection*.  When the jsf-subsystem is started, it scans the module path to find all the installed JSF implementations.  When the JSF subsystem deploys a web app containing the specified context param, it adds the slotted modules to the deployment.  Here is an example of the context param for the latest milestone of Mojarra 2.2: &lt;context-param&gt;    &lt;param-name&gt;org.jboss.jbossfaces.JSF_CONFIG_NAME&lt;/param-name&gt;    &lt;param-value&gt;mojarra-2.2.0-m05&lt;/param-value&gt; &lt;/context-param&gt; *How a JSF implementation is installed* A single JSF implementation is installed using a  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18945 CLI deployment archive.  This archive includes the required jars and module.xml files.  It also includes CLI scripts for installing/uninstalling the JSF impls using the  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4265 CLI module command.  You execute the installation archive like this: The install script inside the archive looks like this: *How the CLI deployment archives are created* A CLI deployment archive for a JSF implementation/version is created using a standalone maven project.  To create an archive with the project, you  call it like this: This pulls in the JSF resources and creates the install/uninstall scripts.  It is all bundled together in an archive (zip) file that is renamed with a .cli extension. My current thinking is that we might not need to release the maven project that creates the CLI deployment archives.  There is a finite number of JSF implementations and versions.  So we could simply create all the possible archives and make them available for download.  I suspect that the total number of these is less than 50.  However, the current implementation relies on a particular version of the jsf-injection module that ships with AS7.  So it really means about 50 archives each time the jsf-injection module changes.  I might be able to eliminate the inclusion of jsf-injection in the future. *Demo* I've attached a copy of install-mojarra-2.2.0-m05.cli and install-myfaces-2.1.8.  You can unzip to take a look at it.  You can even deploy it with the latest nightly build of AS7.   This will let you see how the modules are installed.   I'm not quite done with updates to the jsf-subsystem, so you can't see multi-jsf in action on a webapp yet.  If you want to try it out though, let me know.  I can upload a working version to my github account.</body>

    <body>The previous cumulative file is just part of the snapshot information we persist in the history. For one-offs it points to the current cumulative patch-id, for CPs to the previous. We might want to use that for consistency checks or perhaps just remove the redundant information in case we don't need it in the end. Yes, we are going to backup the patch.xml and misc contents as part of the patches/patch-id (then it could also get re-applied). Since we have the rollback patch.xml we should have all the information we need to detect the points in history where a content item was overriden. Regarding rollbacks i am less worried about the contents, rather the configuration backups. Perhaps we should provide 2 different operations - one for rolling back to YY, which would also rollback XX and a "reset" operation which will also restore the configuration.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Design of AS7	multi-JSF feature</header>
    <body>*About multi-JSF* Currently, AS7 ships with two JSF implementations, a JSF 2.1 implementation and a JSF 1.2 implementation.  A web application can select which implementation is used by including a context param in web.xml.  By default, it uses the JSF 2.1 imlementation. "multi-JSF" allows installation of multiple JSF implementations (and versions) on the same AS7 server.  The goal is to allow use of any JSF implementation (MyFaces or Mojarra) and any version of those implementation from JSF 1.1 all the way up to the experimental JSF 2.2 versions.  This is far superior to the old WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL method because JSF jars do not need to be bundled with the webapp.  More importantly, "multi-JSF" provides an implementation that is fully integrated with the container.  This means more efficient annotation processing, lifecycle handling, and other integration advantages. *How it works* The way multi-JSF will work is that for each JSF version, a new slot is created in the modules path under *com.sun.jsf-impl*, *javax.faces.api*, and *org.jboss.as.jsf-injection*.  When the jsf-subsystem is started, it scans the module path to find all the installed JSF implementations.  When the JSF subsystem deploys a web app containing the specified context param, it adds the slotted modules to the deployment.  Here is an example of the context param for the latest milestone of Mojarra 2.2: &lt;context-param&gt;    &lt;param-name&gt;org.jboss.jbossfaces.JSF_CONFIG_NAME&lt;/param-name&gt;    &lt;param-value&gt;mojarra-2.2.0-m05&lt;/param-value&gt; &lt;/context-param&gt; *How a JSF implementation is installed* A single JSF implementation is installed using a  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18945 CLI deployment archive.  This archive includes the required jars and module.xml files.  It also includes CLI scripts for installing/uninstalling the JSF impls using the  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4265 CLI module command.  You execute the installation archive like this: The install script inside the archive looks like this: *How the CLI deployment archives are created* A CLI deployment archive for a JSF implementation/version is created using a standalone maven project.  To create an archive with the project, you  call it like this: This pulls in the JSF resources and creates the install/uninstall scripts.  It is all bundled together in an archive (zip) file that is renamed with a .cli extension. My current thinking is that we might not need to release the maven project that creates the CLI deployment archives.  There is a finite number of JSF implementations and versions.  So we could simply create all the possible archives and make them available for download.  I suspect that the total number of these is less than 50.  However, the current implementation relies on a particular version of the jsf-injection module that ships with AS7.  So it really means about 50 archives each time the jsf-injection module changes.  I might be able to eliminate the inclusion of jsf-injection in the future. *Demo* I've attached a copy of install-mojarra-2.2.0-m05.cli and install-myfaces-2.1.8.cli.  You can unzip to take a look at it.  You can even deploy it with the latest nightly build of AS7.   This will let you see how the modules are installed.   I'm not quite done with updates to the jsf-subsystem, so you can't see multi-jsf in action on a webapp yet.  If you want to try it out though, let me know.  I can upload a working version to my github account.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>Yes, for history purpose, I think it's important to tell the user which version the patch has been applied to (among all the acceptable &lt;applies-to-version&gt; of the patch). He would want to know what will be the resulting version of a rollback prior to perform it. This contradicts the previous sentence about cumulative patches invalidating all one-off patches. The way I represent the patches is a stack composed of 3 different parts on top of each others:              +--------------------+              |  one-off patches   | * always applied at the top of a base version or a cumulative patch              |                    | * can be empty if no one-off patches have been applied              +--------------------+              | cumulative patches | * stack of applied cumulative patches              |                    | * can be empty if no cumulative patches have been appplied              +--------------------+              |    base version    | * the base version of this AS7 installation              +--------------------+ * always present The stack is ordered by the date at which the patch has been applied, the most recent applied patch is at the top. This is a correct representation if a CP invalidates one-off patches. eg to patch with a new CP, we must first rollback all the applied one-off patches (whether it's part of the patch procedure or an user intervention is to be determined). Playing a bit with a show-history command, I'd expect to have an outcome such as: [standalone at localhost:9999 core-service=patching] :show-history     "outcome" =&gt; "success",         "one-offs" =&gt; [                 "patchID" =&gt; "patch-xyz",                 "applied-to" =&gt; "7.2.3",                 "applied-at" =&gt; "YYYY MM DD, HH:mm"                 "patchID" =&gt; "patch-abc",                 "applied-to" =&gt; "7.2.3",                 "applied-at" =&gt; "YYYY MM DD, HH:mm"         ],         "cumulatives" =&gt; [                 "patchID" =&gt; "patch-YYY",                 "resulting-version" =&gt; "7.2.3",                 "applied-to" =&gt; "7.2.1",                 "applied-at" =&gt; "YYYY MM DD, HH:mm"                 "patchID" =&gt; "patch-XXX",                 "resulting-version" =&gt; "7.2.1",                 "applied-to" =&gt; "7.2.0",                 "applied-at" =&gt; "YYYY MM DD, HH:mm"         ],         "base-version" =&gt; "7.2.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT" what do you think of this "stack" representation of the patches? Is it correct?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Creating a custom HTTPSConnector is JBOSS AS 7.1</header>
    <body>I need to extend the default HTTPS connector in JBOSS AS 7.1 and add some custom code. Are there any examples I can look into to get started ? &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:web:1.2" default-virtual-server="default-host" native="false"&gt; &lt;connector name="https" protocol="HTTP/1.1" scheme="https" socket-binding="https" enable-lookups="false" secure="true"&gt;              &lt;ssl name="ssl"              key-alias="test"              password="nextgen!"              certificate-key-file="/Users/sarul/jboss-as-7.1.3.Final/standalone/configuration/test.keystore"              protocol="TLSv1"              verify-client="false"/&gt;             &lt;/connector&gt;               &lt;connector name="http" protocol="HTTP/1.1" scheme="http" socket-binding="http"/&gt;             &lt;virtual-server name="default-host" enable-welcome-root="true"&gt;                 &lt;alias name="localhost"/&gt;                 &lt;alias name="example.com"/&gt;             &lt;/virtual-server&gt;         &lt;/subsystem&gt; I guess my questions at this point are, 1. Which class implements the default HTTPS connector highlighted above ? 2. Is this class extensible ? Where can I find an example to do that ? 3.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Creating a custom HTTPSConnector is JBOSS AS 7.1</header>
    <body>Looks like the way to do this is write a custom protocol handler class (extending any of the standard handlers like org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol) and specifying that class name in the protocol attribute as follows, &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:web:1.2" default-virtual-server="default-host" native="false"&gt; &lt;connector name="https" protocol="*com.yourcompany.infra.CustomHttpsHandler*" scheme="https" socket-binding="https" enable-lookups="false" secure="true"&gt;              &lt;ssl name="ssl"              key-alias="test"              password="nextgen!"              certificate-key-file="/Users/sarul/jboss-as-7.1.3.Final/standalone/configuration/test.keystore"              protocol="TLSv1"              verify-client="false"/&gt;             &lt;/connector&gt;               &lt;connector name="http" protocol="HTTP/1.1" scheme="http" socket-binding="http"/&gt;             &lt;virtual-server name="default-host" enable-welcome-root="true"&gt;                 &lt;alias name="localhost"/&gt;                 &lt;alias name="example.com"/&gt;             &lt;/virtual-server&gt;         &lt;/subsystem&gt; This seems to work for me so far.</body>

To work around this, just build them locally: cd /tmp; svn co http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/ mvn install -U -f build/parent/pom.xml mvn install -U -f build/tycho-plugins/pom.xml mvn install -U -f build/target-platforms/pom.xml -Pjbosstools-maximum,jbosstools-minimum h3. Maven &amp; Java Memory Configuration To configure the amount of memory used by Maven, you can define MVN_OPTS as follows, either in the mvn / mvn.bat script you use to run Maven, or set as global environment variables. Here's how to do so for  http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=262465 Fedora,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables Ubuntu,  http://forums.techarena.in/windows-xp-support/1152405.htm Windows,  http://www.digitaledgesw.com/node/31 OSX. set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m h2. Verify or Install ? +mvn verify+ will perform all build and test steps, but it won't install the bundles in your local repository. +mvn install+ does install in you local repository. When an eclipse-plugin is installed in your repo, it is always used as default when resolving dependency. It is not possible to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, +mvn verify+ is to be prefered to +mvn install+. However, if you want to build stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use +mvn install+. In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if your use-case requires it. h2. About Target Platform and related profiles The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from this TP are allowed to be used in code. If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&amp;summary=Add%20[YOUR%20REQ]%20to%20Target%20Platform&amp;components=12310540&amp;issuetype=13&amp;Create=Create open a ticket to request it. Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's up to you to choose the one that match your needs: h3. Using published Target Platform definition (Recommanded) unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target Platfrom repository. * Pros:* No additional thing to do than invoking Maven * Always up-to-date * Cons: Speed - (to evaluate) Consume it by adding* +-Punified.target+* to you Maven invocation command-line h3. Or, getting a local copy of the Target Platform * Pros: Speed +++ * Cons: Step to be repeated whenever  https://source.jboss.org/browse/JBossTools/trunk/build/target-platform/unified.target target platform changes h4. Set up h5.  Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder on your disk. For convenience, the easiest is to unzip into jbosstools/build/target-platform/REPO/, since that's where the Maven or Ant process will by default operate. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url:       http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/e420-wtp340.target.zip e420-wtp340.target.zip (current minimum TP)       http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/e421-wtp341.target.zip e421-wtp341.target.zip (current maximum TP) and then unzip it : unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/my jbosstools/build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR0c/local/target/REPO/   or unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/my jbosstools/build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR1a/local/target/REPO/ *(Note that the default path used for &lt;local.site&gt; will change every time a new target platform is released which is a significant change over the previous (eg., SR1, SR2), so if this breaks because the default not points at an empty folder, it's time to get a new TP! Hurray for build-time notification you're using an old target platform!)* h5. OR, use Maven+Ant to get it In that case, you also need Ant 1.8.2 or later*.* cd jbosstools/build/target-platform mvn clean install -Pget.local.target The get.local.target profile will resolve the target platform file, multiple.target, as a p2 repository on your local disk in ~/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/. It may take a while, so you're better off from a speed point-of-view simply fetching the latest zip [5]. However, if you want to see what actually happens to create the TP (as done in Hudson) this is the approach to take. Since the Maven profile is simply a wrapper call to Ant, you can also use Ant 1.8 or later directly: cd jbosstools/build/target-platform ant help # show usage instructions h4. Use Just add -*P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///path/to/target/repository/* *NOTE:* You must specify a path starting with *file:///* (three or more slashes) to avoid errors such as "+p2.core.ProvisionException URI has an authority component+". Examples *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site *-Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/* &gt; build.all.log.txt h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platform and want to test it locally. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. This is only necessary when the TP change, prior to 3.3.Beta3 svn co http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk jbosstools cd jbosstools/build/parent mvn clean install ... [INFO] Reactor Summary: [INFO] [INFO] JBoss Tools Target Platform Definition ............ SUCCESS [0.724s] [INFO] JBoss Tools Parent ................................

Building Individual Components Locally Via Commandline h3. Build a component resolving to a recent aggregation build for other JBT dependencies (Recommanded) * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * Speed to resolve deps: + * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons:* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change. More risk to get out of sync than with the staging site. Tracked by  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 example: *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-staging-aggregate* h3. Build a component resolving to the latest CI builds for other JBT dependencies * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change * Speed to resolve deps: - This profile is the one use for CI builds on Hudson. *cd jmx* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-nightly-staging-composite* h3. Build a component along with all its dependencies from sources ("bootstrap" build) This will build exactly what you have locally * Pros:* You are sure of the version of sources that is used for your JBT dependencies * You don't loose time in resolving your JBT deps * Cons:* You need sources for your dependencies too * You often build more stuff that what you really want to test cd ~/trunk/build mvn verify  -P unified.target -*P jmx-bootstrap* h2. Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd build (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\build mvn3 clean verify -P local.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/    or mvn3 clean verify  -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file:///C:/trunk/build/target-platform/REPO/ &gt; build.all.log.txt If you downloaded the zip and unpacked is somewhere else, use -Dlocal.site=file:///.../ to point at that folder instead h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/indigo/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-56-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-56-13876/310-276/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-56-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-56-13877/450-259/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: +clean install -U -B -fae -e -Plocal.site -Dlocal.site=file://home/nboldt/tmp/JBT_REPO_Indigo/+ Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-56-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-56-13878/450-540/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-56-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-56-13879/450-538/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-56-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-56-13880/450-539/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-56-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-56-13881/450-542/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-56-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-56-13882/450-347/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/runtime.site.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools/trunk/runtime/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., Runtime Detection depends on JBoss Common, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. Dealing with timeouts for tests (To be rewritten soon...)  http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during indigo builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

    <body>How are you using the datasource? I don't think you should need any more configuration besides the datasource in standalone.xml (and you might want to use a pool-name without slashes: e.g. EPCISDBPool).Try java:jboss/datasources/EPCISDB for the name</body>

    <body>Anil and Pedro. (08:36:43 AM) asaldhan: psilva: discuss status of each project. we then can do checkpoints (08:36:53 AM) asaldhan: https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/SECURITY/SecurityProjectsArchitecture (08:36:57 AM) asaldhan: psilva: pl-idm (08:37:10 AM) psilva: asaldhan: you start ? (08:37:58 AM) asaldhan: psilva: for LDAP binding - if the attributes being searched are only custom attributes, then all the users have to be checked. Large data sets, this is a problem.  Need to bring in a cache  (like hibernate 2nd level cache) (08:38:20 AM) asaldhan: psilva: apart from that, pl-idm ldap binding is fine. (08:38:29 AM) asaldhan: psilva: wdyt about jpa? (08:38:56 AM) asaldhan: psilva: pl-idm configuration builders need 2nd look (08:39:10 AM) psilva: asaldhan: jpa is fine. we have creation of users, roles, queries, membership, groups. And query of users, groups, memberships, roles. (08:39:28 AM) ***asaldhan is going to capture all of this in a pbox dev thread. (08:39:29 AM) psilva: asaldhan: the main issue i see with pl-idm are the undefined points along the code .... (08:39:48 AM) ***asaldhan says pl-idm is ready for checkpoint release (08:39:58 AM) psilva: asaldhan: like the IM x IS linkage, some TODOs in the code, duplicated/ambiguos methods, etc. .. (08:40:07 AM) asaldhan: psilva: yeah. (08:40:17 AM) asaldhan: psilva: some methods dont make sense. we need to discuss them. (08:40:23 AM) psilva: asaldhan: +1 (08:40:40 AM) psilva: asaldhan: another point is create a idm example app ... (08:40:47 AM) asaldhan: UserQuery.executeQuery(UserQuery) can go into recursive stack overflow (08:41:06 AM) asaldhan: psilva: right.  we can get viliam to update his idm jquery app too (08:41:19 AM) psilva: asaldhan: yeah ... only the executeQuery() solves the problem ... and this goes to all query interfaces .. (08:41:28 AM) psilva: asaldhan: cool (08:41:52 AM) asaldhan: psilva: PL CDI.  shane checkpointed.  we dont need changes, right? (08:42:29 AM) psilva: asaldhan: until now, no .... (08:42:35 AM) asaldhan: psilva: ok. (08:42:50 AM) asaldhan: psilva: pb CDI (08:44:06 AM) psilva: asaldhan: pb-cdi is fine, i think. i had simplified the config for the PL-IDM support. we have authc and authz, idm to load roles, PL-IDM IdentityManager is exposed to that users can work with it, etc ... (08:44:45 AM) psilva: asaldhan: need to see with the aerogear guys if what we have is enough ... (08:45:02 AM) psilva: asaldhan: i was doing some small changes, will commit later ... (08:49:04 AM) psilva: asaldhan: one important point IMO, is that we need to review the pb-core for PL-IDM native support  ... (08:49:54 AM) asaldhan: psilva: right. (08:50:26 AM) asaldhan: psilva: as a developer, you work in an environment with CDI and without CDI. (08:50:34 AM) asaldhan: psilva: like you may be in tomcat without CDI. (08:50:42 AM) asaldhan: psilva: in that case, he should use pb-core directly. (08:50:51 AM) asaldhan: psilva: if he has CDI enabled, then he should go pb-cdi. (08:50:58 AM) asaldhan: psilva: wdyt? (08:51:15 AM) psilva: asaldhan: agree .. (08:51:26 AM) asaldhan: psilva: people will ask this question (09:16:28 AM) psilva: asaldhan: i was looking to support EL expressions with authorization annotations .... wdyt ? (09:18:17 AM) asaldhan: psilva: regular expressions should be fine.  But ideally they should just use drools, right? (09:18:37 AM) asaldhan: psilva: externalized authz is powerful. No need to change code. (09:19:34 AM) psilva: asaldhan: i agree, but it can be an alternative, more simple to use (not drools dependencies, config, etc) ...</body>

    <body>Hi everyone, I am immigrating jboss4.2.6 -&gt; jboss7 and I have a few questions about the JAAS authentification part. In jboss4, I implements my own WebAuthentication who extends the WebAuthentication class to provide the authentication functions, like this +  @Override+ +  // other login methods+ I understand that in jboss7 the class +WebAuthentication+ has been removed as Servlet 3 provides some login module and WebAuthentication was redundant. However, I am lost. I am using Iceface 1.8.2 / seam2.2 with my application. Iceface 1.8.2 has dependence on servlet-api 2.4/2.5. * Could I use iceface 1.8.2 with servlet-api-3 ? * Are there any examples of the programmatic login implementation of servlet 3 ? Does anybody have any advices ? or are there any examples ? Many thanks in advance.</body>

    <body>Yes, I thought it probably has to do soemhow with the lastest check-ins regarding JSF integration. I'm using the same standalone-full.xml as before. Based on the standard with some modifications for my need. I execute a "diff myconfig/standalone-full.xml build/target/.../configuration/standalone-full.xml" at the end of the process and compare this diff with a saved one to see, if there are new differences that need to be handeled. But the diff did not show any new or changed lines today. My standalone-full already contains |      | &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:jsf:1.0"/&gt; |</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - No EJB receiver available for handling - reconnect</header>
    <body>After several searches, I could not find a solution to my problem. This is my scenario: I have two server applications (A, B), application 'A' is the server and 'B' is the client, ie 'B' consumes the service 'A'. So far it works well, the problem is when I stop the application 'A' and starting again, now in the application 'B' when I try to lookup the EJB application 'A' error occurs: My class that does the lookup: @Stateless @RolesAllowed("ROLE_ADMIN")                                                           // bean                                   // class                       The application 'B' can no longer find the reference of EJB application 'A'. Only works if you restart the application 'B'. Is there a setting to fix this? Without having to restart the application 'B'? If anyone can help me, I'll be very happy. Thank you!</body>

I have this in my web.xml - Servlet API 2.3, &lt;!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN" " http://java.sun.com/dtd/ http://java.sun.com/dtd/*web-app_2_3*.dtd"&gt; In some JSP's, no import statements available for classes like 'java.util.Date', 'java.util.Iterator' etc. In weblogic, these classes get implicitly imported and getting executed fine. In JBoss this throws error like 'Unable to compile class for JSP ... Date cannot be resolved to a type'. I can manually add the necessary import statements in my JSP to make it work fine, but just curious if there is a way in JBoss to achieve implicit package import similar to weblogic.</body>

    <body>The difference is that the script in the archive is executed as a single composite operation. So, looks like the driver is not yet available when the datasource is added.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Wicket and JBoss</header>
    <body>I have a desktop computer at home which all of my development work, but I also have a laptop that will function as a mobile development platform. I'm attempting to get my jboss-as7.1.1 installation on RackSpace to serve my application at my sub-domain.  I have been researching for days trying to figure out how to even use JBoss.  As far as I can tell, there isn't a how to on this.  I can deploy my app to my local server, but it always goes to localhost:8080.  If this is a fully functional root directory type app, why the need for the port number in the domain?  Is there a way to remove this so that my app is just sitting at localhost/ ?  This begs the question: how do you deploy to a specific location? The documentiation seems to be wonderful for someone who has used JBoss before, but not for beginners like me. Thanks for any help you can offer a newbie.</body>

    <body>Excellent!  That takes care of the first item.  Thank you, Stuart! Changing the port did the trick, but it seems like everything is still relative to the root of the domain.  Whether port 8080 or just 80, I'm not able to figure out how to distinguish between a sub-domain and a root.  If I wanted a blog app at blog.mydomain.com and everything else at www.mydomain.com, how would I tell JBoss to do that?</body>

After this method am calling multithreading i.e. +transactionQueueListener[i].start()+ +and inside thread am using the same remote object (+objRemote+) which is declared as public static, whenever am trying to call the method inside the bean by using the remote object i.e.+ +objRemote.ReadTxnFromInputQueueString("inputqueue1"); am getting the exception+ for thread call if am using +thread.run();+ means everything is working am able to call remote method in the bean and result is getting. since am using multi threading i have to use start() method for calling thread.</body>

    <body>Hi there. We are migrating from JBoss5 to JBoss7 and faced the same problem. Thread-A creates the InitContext and does the JNDI EJB lookup and creates the instance of the EJB remote inferface. Thread-A can invoke methods via the EJB remote interface. Thread-B gets the reference of the EJB remote interface. But if Thread-B tries to invoke a method via the EJB remote interface following exception is thrown: Exception in thread "xxx" java.lang.IllegalStateException: No EJBReceiver available for node name oliver2 at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientContext.requireNodeEJBReceiver(EJBClientContext.java:613) at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientContext.requireNodeEJBReceiverContext(EJBClientContext.java:648) at org.jboss.ejb.client.ReceiverInterceptor.handleInvocation(ReceiverInterceptor.java:71) at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientInvocationContext.sendRequest(EJBClientInvocationContext.java:181) Of course accessing the remote interface is serialized via synchronized blocks. I use the same Context properties like  https://community.jboss.org/people/bijoyjp Bijoy James.  Under JBoss5 this has been working. How I can Thread-B allow using the remote interface, which was created from Thread-A? Thanks in advance for any help.</body>

    <body>ok, this is my scenario: I have two server applications (A and B), that communicate via JMS, both using JAAS for user authentication. EJBs for each system uses security JBOSS via @ RolesAllowed ("ROLE_ADMIN"), works just fine so far, I have seen the JASS set up right, and added the 'ApplicationRealm'. The problem is in a third application, a client jar (swing application) that must communicate with the application B. In this third application, when I attempt to lookup remote EJB application B, the lookup to work but when I call a method that must use the EJB, the specified error occurs. ﻿</body>

    <body>I recommend to use the jboss-ejb-client.properties (and not the remoting-project URL remote://... which is deprecated) Have a look to  https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/EJB+invocations+from+a+remote+client+using+JNDI https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/EJB+invocations+from+a+remote+client+using+JNDI Does this work? The reason is that AS7 is a new implementation andtherefor the ejb-client works different, specially in case of multithreading. There is a JIRA with enhancements  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/EJBCLIENT-34 EJBCLIENT-34 for this, but it is not finished right now.

    <body>Hi Wolf-Dieter During testing I faced something really strange. If my multithreading remote client runs under JRE 1.6.0_27 everything is fine, as I confirmed. But if I let run the same remote client under other JRE versions like 1.6.0_21 or 1.6.0_34, after some remote method invocations I get again the IllegalStateException: No EJBReceiver available for node name oliver2 This is the StackTrace: java.lang.IllegalStateException: No EJBReceiver available for node name oliver2 at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientContext.requireNodeEJBReceiver(EJBClientContext.java:613) at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientContext.requireNodeEJBReceiverContext(EJBClientContext.java:648) at org.jboss.ejb.client.ReceiverInterceptor.handleInvocation(ReceiverInterceptor.java:71) at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientInvocationContext.sendRequest(EJBClientInvocationContext.java:181) at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBInvocationHandler.doInvoke(EJBInvocationHandler.java:136) at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBInvocationHandler.doInvoke(EJBInvocationHandler.java:121) at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBInvocationHandler.invoke(EJBInvocationHandler.java:104) That means I still have a problem. What does it really mean that “No EJBReceiver” is available? What can I do to make an “EJBReceiver” available? Can I increase something in the JBoss EBJClient? And really strange is the different between the JRE versions on client side. My JBoss runs under JDK 1.6.0_27 or JDK 1.6.0_34, but this make no different.</body>

    <body>The client context will be initialized by the jboss-ejb-client.properties and/or the InitialContext. In fact for both there is a list of available server-connections. If you do a lookup(...) the client create a Proxy based on the Remote interface (notice there is no server access as this was in previous versions!) If you use the proxy and execute a method the list of servers are hunted whether it can handle the request (EJB identificator is [ejb:]app/modul/bean!view) All possibilities are given to a selector class (default is Random....) to choice one of the posibilities. If there are none you get such Exception reasons: * no EJB with that name deployed * no server available  (for this ejb) * connection closed by error (should be reopend if possible) If you run the same code in different JVM versions, your behaviour looks like a JVM bug (nio), What if you use the last Java7 (I would prefer that for AS7) Could you reproduce it with a upstream compilation (As7.2.X or 7.1.3)? You might set logging org.jboss.ejb.client=TRACE to see more informations</body>

    <body>I think now my problem solved and its working fine. I used below code   /*   * jar name is JMSRa */ If am not using jndiContext.close();  means my application is not working, I don’t kno what’s the reason And "jboss-ejb-client.properties" in the client application class path also. In the “jboss-ejb-client.properties” file I used below properties      remote.connections=default      remote.connection.default.host=localhost      remote.connection.default.port=4447      remote.connectionprovider.create.options.org.xnio.Options.SSL_ENABLED=false      remote.connection.default.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS=false Thanks for  https://community.jboss.org/people/wdfink Wolf-Dieter Fink and  https://community.jboss.org/people/olli24 Oliver Katzer for your  valuable helps</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JBoss AS 7 Startup	time</header>
    <body>Dear JBoss AS community, This question is about deploying the jbpm5 web applications to the AS 7 . The jbpm5 project provides totally six WARs to be deployed on the AS 7 . However , I have to  wait about 10 minutes for all these six WARS to deploy successfully. I found that these six WARs will be exploded to about 1GB data during the deployment .It may be one of the reasons about the long deployment time. So , I want to ask (1) Jboss give me the impression that it is lightening fast and has the http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/#speed  blazing fast start-up time . So I suspect that  is it normal or take too long? If it is nornaml , any ways to reduce the deployment time? (2) Most importantly , I find that whenever the jboss restart, all six WARs will be  exploded again to about 1GB data  even there are no changes in these WARs.  Can I configure JBoss such that it can detect if there are changes in these WARs , and only deploy the "delta" instead of all  six WARs every time during startup  ? Thanks  :)</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Bpmn2 custom elements</header>
    <body>Hello everybody. I'm new to bpmn2 development and I had an assignment to add some custom elements to an eclipse plugin of jbpmn. I downloaded the source code and started to look around. I need to add elements like Email Task and Log Task that are in a package apart called org.eclipse.bpmn2.modeler.extras. So I created my own package to include my elements. I changed a code a little bit and it works but the problem is that when I reopen the editor it shows me a raw Task figure. But the thing is that a native Email Task element becomes the raw Task figure as well, loosing it's envelope image in the upper left corner. Than i looked in bpmn2 diagram file and it's xml representation of Email Task is the same of that of a normal Task, same thing with my element.      &lt;bpmn2:task id="Task_2" drools:taskName="email" name="Email Task"/&gt;      &lt;bpmn2:task id="Task_3" drools:taskName="dutyBinding" name="MyCustomElement"/&gt; I tried to replicate UserTask element because it is the one that works the way I would to, like but I can't get it to work. I'd prefer to have a package apart like modeler.extras but any way would do.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: How to programatically manage 1, 000 to 6, 000 outbound ejb connections in JBoss7?</header>
    <body>Hi James, you are right and not alone in this point, there are several issues around migrating 'EJB-calls'. the EJB is identified by it's name '+ejb:&lt;app&gt;/&lt;module&gt;/distinct-name&gt;/&lt;Bean&gt;!&lt;View&gt;+' and the selector will try one of the available references. It is not possible to select a special server/bean with the current implementation. With the management API you are able to create remote connections, but AFAIK you need to restart the server (which is also possible via CLI if you use doamain mode). But from my perspective this looks also not feasible  :( There are several changes in progress but they are still not finished. I think there will be an enhancement that the application can have more control about the EJB-selection without such configuration and direct access to the JBoss specific API classes. You might watch the following JIRA's  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/EJBCLIENT-34 EJBCLIENT-34  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5047 AS7-5047 Also I'm working on some quickstarts in this area, you might watch  https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Contributing+a+Quickstart this documentation (keep in mind that the link might change for 7.2 and further releases). If there are enhancements I hope that I (or someone else) add this to the existing or some new quickstarts to the " http://www.jboss.org/developer JBoss Developer Framework" in time.</body>

    <body>Thanks you sir, for confirming my suspicions. We have been able to work around this for the time being by switching to a model where remote only contacts central.  Most of our functionality over EJB is remote looking up to central so with the exception of one corner case (which we are fixing with a rest service), we are able to proceed. -James</body>

    <body>Deploying a resource adapter archive in the deployments directory should work just as with any other archive deployment type (WAR, EAR ...). You will need to of course fully specify the deployment properties for your resource adapter in either the ra.xml or ironjacamar.xml files in the META-INF directory of your resource archive. Alternatively you can use the AS7 Admin GUI to do the deployment under the 'Managed Deployments' tab. HTH'</body>

    <body>Hi, In JBoss AS7, i'm using this: service:jmx:remoting-jmx://my_host_name:port to connect to either a standalone mode server or a domain mode server. In standalone mode: I can retreive the MBean jboss.as:deployment=myEar.ear, and then able to deploy, redeploy, undeploy or remove myEar.ear This works great ! However, In domain mode: I have 3-4 ears deployed on this server, belonging to different server groups. There is only a few MBeans (not interesting for deploying) availables, and mainly, no jboss.as:deployment=myEar.ear available, or any MBeans related to server-groups or cluster etc... I'm thinking that there must be a xml configuration file (domain.xml,host.xml,....) somewhere to offer the wanted MBeans ? Why standalone mode has the jboss.as:deployment MBean and not the domain mode ? JBoss AS7 is installed on Linux 2.6.32-279.5.2.el6.x86_64 Any idea ?</body>

    <body>Hi,      The whole concept of Domain mode is to have a centeralized controll over your whole domain.... Like deployment/Undeployment... etc. Everything should be achevable through Domain Controller  (Rather than contacting individual JBos Servers which are part of domain)      In Domain mode we have a concept of "server-groups"   (which are based on some profiles like ha, full-ha, full, default...etc).    We Target applications to "server-groups"   (Not to individual servers in Domain mode).   So definitely you will not see any such MBean on Individual Server which you can use to deploy an application on a JBoss instance which is running as part of Domain mode.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss ESB Development] - Pipeline interceptor	triggers multip</header>
    <body>I am working on a project that "sniffs" (intercepts) all messages that are being send through ESB. I use JBoss AS 6 with ESB 4.11. I am sending both esb-aware and JMS messages and everything works, but it seems that my interceptor intercepts every message mulptiple times. At the moment, the Interceptor class just prints the concent + some other stuff to console. When I send a message, it displays the sent message multiple times (3 times to be more specific). So my question is: *Why?*. Is this normal behavior? I have no clue where the mistake could be. I think that is could be one of these two options: 1) I have some error in my sending class, but I dont think thats the issue, since I use simply one serviceInvoker and my code is very similar to sample quickstarts. Standard output from gateway listeners also indicate that message is sent only ones... 2) Pipeline Interceptor intercepts the message multiple times, every time at a different stage of the pipeline. But how to test if this is the issue? My properties file section for interceptors looks like this: &lt;properties name="interceptors"&gt;     &lt;property name="org.jboss.soa.esb.pipeline.failure.interceptors" value="interceptor.Interceptor"/&gt;       &lt;property name="org.jboss.soa.esb.pipeline.instantiate.interceptors" value="interceptor.Interceptor"/&gt;     &lt;property name="org.jboss.soa.esb.pipeline.start.interceptors" value="interceptor.Interceptor"/&gt;     &lt;property name="org.jboss.soa.esb.pipeline.end.interceptors" value="interceptor.Interceptor"/&gt; &lt;/properties&gt; I tried to delete some of the properties but then it either doesnt intercept anything at all or it triggers multiple times! Thanks for any tips!</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - JTA 1.2	Implementation Work</header>
    <body>h1. WARNING: THIS IS NOT YET READY FOR REVIEW. This document discusses the outstanding issues and design decisions relating to our implementation of the JTA 1.2 specification. The JTA 1.2 Spec and JavaDoc can be obtained from  https://java.net/projects/jta-spec/sources/spec-source-repository/show here. The two major changes are @Transactional (EJB-like transaction annotations for managed beans) and @TransactionScoped (A CDI scope tied to the lifecycle of the active transaction). Each of these is covered in it's own section bellow. There are some smaller changes too, for which it is yet to be determinned if they require any code changes. These are all discussed in the "Other Changes" section. h3. @TransactionScoped Implementing a new context in CDI is relativly straight-forward. You just need to implement the javax.enterprise.context.spi.Context interface. Here's the pseudo code for this impl:         private TransactionalBeanStore //Maintains a map of transaction to asociated beans. Garbage collection method is open for discussion (see later)                       bean = (PassivationCapabale) contextual                return bean                create new bean                add bean to TransactionalBeanStore                return bean                    return null       h4. Design Decisions h6. Do we Implement from scratch or extend a Weld Abstract Context? Weld implements many different Contexts (SessionScoped, ApplicationScoped, RequestScoped, etc) and as a result many of the common implementation details have been abstracted into a largish class heirachy, making the actual implementations of the specific Contexts much simpler. We may be able to extend one of these Abstract Contexts. However, it's not clear to me exactly which one should be extended. Also, this would place a dependency on Weld, which I'm not sure is a good idea. I think it would be better to simply depend on the CDI API, so that our implemntatin remains portable. Also the implementation of the TransactionContext is quite simple, so we may be over-engineering the solution by extending a Weld Context. h6. How are the out-of-scope beans garbage-collected? The 'isActive' method ensures that the context is recognised as inactive, outside of an active transaction. However, the TransactionalBeanStore will collect garbage over time and so needs clearing at some point after the Context is no longer active. These are the current options that I think we have: * AfterCompletion hook.</body>

    <body>What I said was only partially correct. We call end on suspended RMs if delist hasn't been called. Having this happen for all RMs is easy, but we'd have to be aware of interface changes and semantic changes, since it is not backwardly compatible *unless* we have this as a configurable option. Worth considering though, since JTA 1.2 adoption will take a while.</body>

  <mail>
    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Re: JTA 1.2	Implementation Work</header>
    <body>You should implement the context from scratch. Weld has a clearly (and carefully) defined split between API/SPI and impl. If a class is in the weld-api or weld-spi, you can be sure that we follow the rules around deprecation and api stability, and do not change these apis from one micro release to another, and deprecate between minors etc. If it's in weld-impl, you can expect it to change without warning or recourse! You should be implementing AlterableContext as you are targeting CDI 1.1. This gives you a destroy callback, which may be useful for cleanup. Ask Stuart Douglas about activation. I would write @Transactional from scratch. Use @Priority to activate by default. The JTA spec should tell you what value to use.</body>

More generally, couldn't the interceptors go in a new module: ArjunaJTA/cdi This is because the raw jta/ module now has some dependencies that may not make sense in a standalone scenario (but would be acceptable in narayana-jta uber jar). It still a good question about when you can actually execute the test phase as you need the container to have its version of Narayana replaced, currently we have to do these tests in scripts/hudson/narayana.sh after we have built the AS with Narayana in it. Maybe these cdi integration tests  should be moved to qa/ somewhere (on a related note, perhaps the XTS tests should exist under there too)? The AS for example has a "testsuite" hierarchy for integration tests. Tom</body>

    <body>h3. Re: h3. How are the out-of-scope beans garbage-collected? I would say that the afterCompletion seems to be the most intuitive solution rather than a new SPI. As you say, this should be compatible with the wording around not being able to rely on the context at this point.</body>

    <body>Tom, Agreed. I've updated the doc. Same applies for the Context too. I'm not sure what moving them to QA would buy us? The reason why AS has them there is that they can have maven run them after the 'build' module has been built and thus the AS is available. We still have to complete a Narayana and WildFly build before we can run our integration tests. So we would still need to drive these tests from the script.</body>

    <body>h3. Re: What's the best way to enable this feature in WildFly? The Context needs to be enabled via a CDI Extension. I'm currently enabling this via a configuration file (javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension) placed in the META-INF of the application. I think this is the way to do this for applications that run in a simple CDI container. However, we can remove this burden for applications deployed to WildFly. It's quite simple to enable this Extension in a DeploymentProcessor of the transactions SubSystem. However, we would need to either, enable it for all deployments, or just those that use @TransactionScoped (I don't yet know how to detect this). Does enabling the extension when an application does not use it add overhead to the application? Maybe provide a way to disable it rather than enable it if so?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Re: JTA 1.2	Implementation Work</header>
    <body>Tom, Yes, I think I can use TransactionalException in the transaction interceptors. However, I was more thinking about what to do in the TransactionalContext. Here's an example: The TransactionalContext needs to lookup the transaction manager. If this fails, a javax.transaction.SystemException is thrown. This has to be handled (it extends Exception) and the Context interface does not declare that any checked exceptions can be thrown from its methods. Therefore I need to wrap the javax.transaction.SystemException in some unchecked transaction. TransactionalException is the only RuntimeException in the JTA 1.2 spec, so I'll just use whatever general unchecked exception we use in the JTA 1.1 implementation.</body>

    <body>Design notes for work on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-456 (formerly  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-444 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-444). My current development topic branch for this is  https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/tree/WFLY-456-audit-log https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/tree/WFLY-456-audit-log (More current than  https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/AS7-444 https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/AS7-444, note that these are personal branches; I make no guarantees not to change its commit history.)  This branch is based on work previously done by John Bailey. Design notes: 1) Processing location in OperationContext a) when done b) when decision to not proceed is made in OperationContext 2) Log record format: a) date b) read-only? c) boot? d) (if boot) version (as string???) e) rollback? f) userid (TODO get this somehow) g) uuid (for domain ops only, to track across processes) h) isServer? i) primary (domain or server) model hash j) if (!isServer) secondary (host) model hash k) overall hash l) num operations m) operations (one at a time) n) length of a-&gt;j (scan from end to last boot during validation; alternative is to write the length first and scan from beginning to last boot) 3) Index record format: a) overall hash 4) Mgmt operations a) truncate (back to last boot) i) don't discard previous; just write under a different file name b) read log (params -- from (default 0); batch-size (default 20; -1 means all)) c) validate log d) config changes 5) Validation: a) compare persisted model hash to current model b) scan back through log to last config-file-modified boot or version-change boot. We stop at version-change boot to avoid spurious validation problems resulting from changes in model construction across versions c) recreate by re-running ops -- validation problems a) need to verify model hash at each stage -- special controller that ignores all runtime ops   i) problem -- how to recreate domain ops involving remote slaves that don't exist?   ii) problem -- ops with attachments -- attachments won't exist   iii) this "special controller" could end up duplicating a lot of logic just for validation b) reads and runtime ops cannot be verified against model; it can only be confirmed that their hash is consistent with subsequent hashes in the log. Tamper resistant as modification would require modifying all subsequent log entries, but not tamper proof as this could be done. 6) Domain mode a) tracking requests from master to slaves apply a uuid to requests -- as a header include uuid in log record b) detecting host.xml config changes at boot problem -- can't detect host.xml config changes at boot, as model changes may be due to domain.xml stuff coming from the master so, independent domain and host logging but, what about non-model affecting ops? log twice? c) domain logging on slaves? only if --backup-dc is set? -- no simpler to just log d) remote-slave-only logging on master? yes, to maintain a complete record of what was done 7) Non-model-affecting ops a) re-calculating the model hash for all such ops is too expensive b) store the hash(es) in the ModelController along with the model c) provide the hash along with the model to OperationContext d) when model is updated recalc hashes 8) Config a) &lt;audit-log&gt; element b) part of &lt;management&gt; section c) resource is /core-service=audit-log d) attributes i) path (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) ii) relative-to (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) iii) log-read-only? iv) daily-rolling??? (hassle; tempting to defer to later release but it's probably necessary immediately) 9) Other issues a) disable logging overhead for dev scenarios   i) to disable it during initial boot (until whatever config element that turns it on/off is read) -- maintain log data in memory and only write on last boot op b) parallel boot handlers should not log c) fluctuating model hashes   i) if op took the controller lock, that lock ensures proper ordering of model hashes   ii) if op does not take controller lock (reads) earlier model hashes can intermix with later -- validation needs to account for this *Suggested configuration* Only relevant elements to audit logging have been included in the following examples. *+jboss-as-config (i.e. standlone.xml and host.xml)+ * This defines a set of audit-log-appenders which are referenced by the audit-log element.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Audit Logging Design	Notes</header>
    <body>Design notes for work on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-456 (formerly  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-444 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-444). My current development topic branch for this is  https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/tree/WFLY-456-audit-log https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/tree/WFLY-456-audit-log (More current than  https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/AS7-444 https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/AS7-444, note that these are personal branches; I make no guarantees not to change its commit history.)  This branch is based on work previously done by John Bailey. Design notes: 1) Processing location in OperationContext a) when done b) when decision to not proceed is made in OperationContext 2) Log record format: a) date b) read-only? c) boot? d) (if boot) version (as string???) e) rollback? f) userid (TODO get this somehow) g) uuid (for domain ops only, to track across processes) h) isServer? i) primary (domain or server) model hash j) if (!isServer) secondary (host) model hash k) overall hash l) num operations m) operations (one at a time) n) length of a-&gt;j (scan from end to last boot during validation; alternative is to write the length first and scan from beginning to last boot) 3) Index record format: a) overall hash 4) Mgmt operations a) truncate (back to last boot) i) don't discard previous; just write under a different file name b) read log (params -- from (default 0); batch-size (default 20; -1 means all)) c) validate log d) config changes 5) Validation: a) compare persisted model hash to current model b) scan back through log to last config-file-modified boot or version-change boot. We stop at version-change boot to avoid spurious validation problems resulting from changes in model construction across versions c) recreate by re-running ops -- validation problems a) need to verify model hash at each stage -- special controller that ignores all runtime ops   i) problem -- how to recreate domain ops involving remote slaves that don't exist?   ii) problem -- ops with attachments -- attachments won't exist   iii) this "special controller" could end up duplicating a lot of logic just for validation b) reads and runtime ops cannot be verified against model; it can only be confirmed that their hash is consistent with subsequent hashes in the log. Tamper resistant as modification would require modifying all subsequent log entries, but not tamper proof as this could be done. 6) Domain mode a) tracking requests from master to slaves apply a uuid to requests -- as a header include uuid in log record b) detecting host.xml config changes at boot problem -- can't detect host.xml config changes at boot, as model changes may be due to domain.xml stuff coming from the master so, independent domain and host logging but, what about non-model affecting ops? log twice? c) domain logging on slaves? only if --backup-dc is set? -- no simpler to just log d) remote-slave-only logging on master? yes, to maintain a complete record of what was done 7) Non-model-affecting ops a) re-calculating the model hash for all such ops is too expensive b) store the hash(es) in the ModelController along with the model c) provide the hash along with the model to OperationContext d) when model is updated recalc hashes 8) Config a) &lt;audit-log&gt; element b) part of &lt;management&gt; section c) resource is /core-service=audit-log d) attributes i) path (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) ii) relative-to (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) iii) log-read-only? iv) daily-rolling??? (hassle; tempting to defer to later release but it's probably necessary immediately) 9) Other issues a) disable logging overhead for dev scenarios   i) to disable it during initial boot (until whatever config element that turns it on/off is read) -- maintain log data in memory and only write on last boot op b) parallel boot handlers should not log c) fluctuating model hashes   i) if op took the controller lock, that lock ensures proper ordering of model hashes   ii) if op does not take controller lock (reads) earlier model hashes can intermix with later -- validation needs to account for this *Suggested configuration* Only relevant elements to audit logging have been included in the following examples. *+jboss-as-config (i.e. standlone.xml and host.xml)+ * This defines a set of audit-log-appenders which are referenced by the audit-log element.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Audit Logging Design	Notes</header>
    <body>Design notes for work on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-456 (formerly  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-444 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-444). My current development topic branch for this is  https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/tree/WFLY-456-audit-log https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/tree/WFLY-456-audit-log (More current than  https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/AS7-444 https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/AS7-444, note that these are personal branches; I make no guarantees not to change its commit history.)  This branch is based on work previously done by John Bailey. Design notes: 1) Processing location in OperationContext a) when done b) when decision to not proceed is made in OperationContext 2) Log record format: a) date b) read-only? c) boot? d) (if boot) version (as string???) e) rollback? f) userid (TODO get this somehow) g) uuid (for domain ops only, to track across processes) h) isServer? i) primary (domain or server) model hash j) if (!isServer) secondary (host) model hash k) overall hash l) num operations m) operations (one at a time) n) length of a-&gt;j (scan from end to last boot during validation; alternative is to write the length first and scan from beginning to last boot) 3) Index record format: a) overall hash 4) Mgmt operations a) truncate (back to last boot) i) don't discard previous; just write under a different file name b) read log (params -- from (default 0); batch-size (default 20; -1 means all)) c) validate log d) config changes 5) Validation: a) compare persisted model hash to current model b) scan back through log to last config-file-modified boot or version-change boot. We stop at version-change boot to avoid spurious validation problems resulting from changes in model construction across versions c) recreate by re-running ops -- validation problems a) need to verify model hash at each stage -- special controller that ignores all runtime ops   i) problem -- how to recreate domain ops involving remote slaves that don't exist?   ii) problem -- ops with attachments -- attachments won't exist   iii) this "special controller" could end up duplicating a lot of logic just for validation b) reads and runtime ops cannot be verified against model; it can only be confirmed that their hash is consistent with subsequent hashes in the log. Tamper resistant as modification would require modifying all subsequent log entries, but not tamper proof as this could be done. 6) Domain mode a) tracking requests from master to slaves apply a uuid to requests -- as a header include uuid in log record b) detecting host.xml config changes at boot problem -- can't detect host.xml config changes at boot, as model changes may be due to domain.xml stuff coming from the master so, independent domain and host logging but, what about non-model affecting ops? log twice? c) domain logging on slaves? only if --backup-dc is set? -- no simpler to just log d) remote-slave-only logging on master? yes, to maintain a complete record of what was done 7) Non-model-affecting ops a) re-calculating the model hash for all such ops is too expensive b) store the hash(es) in the ModelController along with the model c) provide the hash along with the model to OperationContext d) when model is updated recalc hashes 8) Config a) &lt;audit-log&gt; element b) part of &lt;management&gt; section c) resource is /core-service=audit-log d) attributes i) path (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) ii) relative-to (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) iii) log-read-only? iv) daily-rolling??? (hassle; tempting to defer to later release but it's probably necessary immediately) 9) Other issues a) disable logging overhead for dev scenarios   i) to disable it during initial boot (until whatever config element that turns it on/off is read) -- maintain log data in memory and only write on last boot op b) parallel boot handlers should not log c) fluctuating model hashes   i) if op took the controller lock, that lock ensures proper ordering of model hashes   ii) if op does not take controller lock (reads) earlier model hashes can intermix with later -- validation needs to account for this *Suggested configuration* Only relevant elements to audit logging have been included in the following examples. *+jboss-as-config (i.e. standlone.xml and host.xml)+ * This defines a set of audit-log-appenders which are referenced by the audit-log element. Currently encryption/tamper detection is not a requirement so all logs are done in clear text. If encryption/tamper detection later becomes a requirement this could be added by for example an audit-log-formatters section which configures whatever we would like to use for encryption/tamper detection and the file-audit-log-appender and syslog-audit-log-appender could individually be made to reference an audit-log-formatter.     &lt;xs:complexType name="domain-managementType"&gt;         &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                 Domain-wide default configuration settings for the management of standalone servers and a Host Controller.             &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;         &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;         &lt;xs:sequence&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="security-realms" minOccurs="0"&gt;                 &lt;xs:complexType&gt;                     &lt;xs:sequence&gt;                         &lt;xs:element name="security-realm" type="security-realmType" minOccurs="1"                                     maxOccurs="unbounded"/&gt;                     &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;                 &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;             &lt;/xs:element&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="outbound-connections" minOccurs="0"&gt;                 &lt;xs:complexType&gt;                     &lt;xs:sequence&gt;                       &lt;xs:element name="ldap" type="ldapType" minOccurs="1" /&gt; &lt;!-- TODO minOccurs only while ldap is only supported connection. --&gt;                     &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;                 &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;             &lt;/xs:element&gt;             &lt;xs:sequence minOccurs="0"&gt;                &lt;xs:element name="audit-log-appenders" type="audit-log-appendersType"/&gt;                &lt;xs:element name="audit-log" type="audit-logType"/&gt;             &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;         &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;     &lt;xs:complexType name="audit-log-appendersType"&gt;         &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                 Declaration of management operation audit logging appenders.             &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;         &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;         &lt;xs:choice minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded"&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="file-appender" type="file-audit-log-appenderType"/&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="syslog-appender" type="syslog-audit-log-appenderType"/&gt;         &lt;/xs:choice&gt;     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;     &lt;xs:complexType name="file-audit-log-appenderType"&gt;          &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                Configuration of a simple file appender for the audit log.

Tamper resistant as modification would require modifying all subsequent log entries, but not tamper proof as this could be done. 6) Domain mode a) tracking requests from master to slaves apply a uuid to requests -- as a header include uuid in log record b) detecting host.xml config changes at boot problem -- can't detect host.xml config changes at boot, as model changes may be due to domain.xml stuff coming from the master so, independent domain and host logging but, what about non-model affecting ops? log twice? c) domain logging on slaves? only if --backup-dc is set? -- no simpler to just log d) remote-slave-only logging on master? yes, to maintain a complete record of what was done 7) Non-model-affecting ops a) re-calculating the model hash for all such ops is too expensive b) store the hash(es) in the ModelController along with the model c) provide the hash along with the model to OperationContext d) when model is updated recalc hashes 8) Config a) &lt;audit-log&gt; element b) part of &lt;management&gt; section c) resource is /core-service=audit-log d) attributes i) path (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) ii) relative-to (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) iii) log-read-only? iv) daily-rolling??? (hassle; tempting to defer to later release but it's probably necessary immediately) 9) Other issues a) disable logging overhead for dev scenarios   i) to disable it during initial boot (until whatever config element that turns it on/off is read) -- maintain log data in memory and only write on last boot op b) parallel boot handlers should not log c) fluctuating model hashes   i) if op took the controller lock, that lock ensures proper ordering of model hashes   ii) if op does not take controller lock (reads) earlier model hashes can intermix with later -- validation needs to account for this *Suggested configuration* Only relevant elements to audit logging have been included in the following examples. *+jboss-as-config (i.e. standlone.xml and host.xml)+ * This defines a set of audit-log-appenders which are referenced by the audit-log element. Currently encryption/tamper detection is not a requirement so all logs are done in clear text. If encryption/tamper detection later becomes a requirement this could be added by for example an audit-log-formatters section which configures whatever we would like to use for encryption/tamper detection and the file-audit-log-appender and syslog-audit-log-appender could individually be made to reference an audit-log-formatter.     &lt;xs:complexType name="domain-managementType"&gt;         &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                 Domain-wide default configuration settings for the management of standalone servers and a Host Controller.             &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;         &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;         &lt;xs:sequence&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="security-realms" minOccurs="0"&gt;                 &lt;xs:complexType&gt;                     &lt;xs:sequence&gt;                         &lt;xs:element name="security-realm" type="security-realmType" minOccurs="1"                                     maxOccurs="unbounded"/&gt;                     &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;                 &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;             &lt;/xs:element&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="outbound-connections" minOccurs="0"&gt;                 &lt;xs:complexType&gt;                     &lt;xs:sequence&gt;                       &lt;xs:element name="ldap" type="ldapType" minOccurs="1" /&gt; &lt;!-- TODO minOccurs only while ldap is only supported connection. --&gt;                     &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;                 &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;             &lt;/xs:element&gt;             &lt;xs:sequence minOccurs="0"&gt;                &lt;xs:element name="audit-log-appenders" type="audit-log-appendersType"/&gt;                &lt;xs:element name="audit-log" type="audit-logType"/&gt;             &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;         &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;     &lt;xs:complexType name="audit-log-appendersType"&gt;         &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                 Declaration of management operation audit logging appenders.             &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;         &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;         &lt;xs:choice minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded"&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="file-appender" type="file-audit-log-appenderType"/&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="syslog-appender" type="syslog-audit-log-appenderType"/&gt;         &lt;/xs:choice&gt;     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;     &lt;xs:complexType name="file-audit-log-appenderType"&gt;          &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                Configuration of a simple file appender for the audit log.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Web Development] - Error 403 instead of	login page</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm working on an app with resteasy. The client (HTML, CSS, Javascript) reach the server via rest/json. When the session expires on server I see a message on JBoss Console: Entering logout ... logged out Subject Until now everything is ok. But when the client try to access the server after that through PUT or DELETE method, it receives an error 403. If the method is POST or GET it receives the login page. My problem is: I need to show a login page when the session expires since there are links in the app that the user doesn't have access and in that case the ajax receives 403. So, in the ajax, when I receive 403, I don't know if the session have expired or the user have tried to acess an unauthorized resource. The problem only appears with PUT and DELETE methods. Is it a bug?

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - exclude XMLSEC and	XALAN</header>
    <body>AS 7.1.1. I'm experiencing a version incompatibility between the XMLSEC (Santuario) and XALAN libraries used by Jboss. The error comes at the point where XMLSEC attempts to instatiate an XpathContext object. The XpathContext, in urn, has a private DTMManager which is being created by newInstance(). The newInstance returns an instance of org.apache.xml.dtm.ref.DTMManagerDefault which canot be cast to org.apache.xml.dtm.DTMManager. The XMLSecurityRuntimeException forgets to mention the original cause of ClassCastException. So, I'd rather use my own versions of XMLSEC and XALAN. I saw how JBoss uses it's own version of XMLSEC. It even replaces the version incorporated into the JDK. Here is the snippet from definition of javaee.api |      | &lt;module name="org.apache.santuario.xmlsec" export="true"&gt; | |          | &lt;exports&gt; | |              | &lt;include-set&gt; | |                  | &lt;path name="javax/xml/crypto"/&gt; | |                  | &lt;path name="javax/xml/crypto/dom"/&gt; | |                  | &lt;path name="javax/xml/crypto/dsig"/&gt; | |                  | &lt;path name="javax/xml/crypto/dsig/dom"/&gt; | |                  | &lt;path name="javax/xml/crypto/dsig/keyinfo"/&gt; | |                  | &lt;path name="javax/xml/crypto/dsig/spec"/&gt; | |              | &lt;/include-set&gt; | |          | &lt;/exports&gt; | |      | &lt;/module&gt; | I read the advice given at  https://community.jboss.org/message/637818#637818 https://community.jboss.org/message/637818 So, I tried my hand. In jboss-deployment-structure.xml I excluded the XmlSec used by Jboss &lt;jboss-deployment-structure&gt;     &lt;deployment&gt;         &lt;exclusions&gt;                            &lt;module name="org.apache.xalan" /&gt;                        &lt;module name="org.apache.santuario.xmlsec"/&gt;         &lt;/exclusions&gt;         &lt;dependencies&gt;             &lt;module name="javaee.api" &gt;                 &lt;imports&gt;                     &lt;exclude-set&gt;                              &lt;path name="org.apache.santuario.xmlsec"/&gt;                     &lt;/exclude-set&gt;                 &lt;/imports&gt;             &lt;/module&gt;                                &lt;/dependencies&gt;     &lt;/deployment&gt; &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt; For some reason, it did not work. I can still see in the stack trace xmlsec.1.5.1 which is the JBoss version Regards, Andrew</body>

    <body>Yes, the attachments are out of date.  The version I'm working on now does not package the jsf-injection jar in the *.cli file.   The jsf-injection jar actually does not need to be different for each slot.  It's the same bits.  The only difference is the JSF API slot that is listed as a dependency in the modules.xml for jsf-injection.  I can't really explain it well, but you should see a better version of the *.cli file soon and it will make sense. Long story short, this feature is considered a Tech Preview until at least the first version or two of WildFly comes out.  Stuff may break from version to version until we get things nailed down better.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - TransactionMonitoringAndVisualization</header>
    <body>h1. Transaction Monitoring and Visualization h3. Overview of the Tool The purpose of this project is to create a tool for monitoring the status of in-flight and complete transactions. The main aims of the tool are to help debug transaction related issues and also to provide insight into the running of the system. Essentially, the tool monitors a running system (or a log from a running system) and produces a detailed list of all transactions. A user may then select a particular transaction to see in more detail, including the participants involved in the transaction, the outcome of the transaction and the participants that influenced the outcome. The tool could be visual, showing a diagrammatic view of a transaction or may be command line based, producing a textual output (or maybe both). h3. What Problems does this solve? * Transaction Timeout detection. We frequently get support requests (via the forums or elsewhere) from users who are experiencing intermittent rollbacks of transactions due to timeout. It is not a simple matter for the user to figure out that this is what's happening. * Transaction Profiling. It may be relatively easy to detect transactions that are taking longer than desired to complete. However, diagnosing which party in the transaction is to blame is non-trivial. * Loops and Diamonds detection. In a distributed transaction it is possible to introduce a loop or a diamond without realizing. JTS may tolerate this, but distributed JTA and bridged WS-AT to JTA does not. Identifying this scenario is non-trivial and requires detailed internal knowledge of the TM. * Reasoning about the System Architecture. Producing an architectural diagram of a distributed transaction with many participants and servers is not an easy task.  Furthermore it can be error prone and could change based on the application inputs. The difficulty of this task is further compounded if multiple transaction types are involved (WS-AT, WS-BA, REST-AT, etc). This diagram is essential for reasoning about the current architecture and for considering improvements or changes. Also this diagram alone may not be enough without detailed profiling overlayed. * Analyzing Disk Syncs. One approach to improving the performance of a transaction is to reduce the number of disk syncs. The problem is that it is often difficult to calculate exactly how many you are performing and what delay each adds. h3. Who is the target audience? * End users, to diagnose their own issues * GSS, to diagnose customer issues * Architects, to analyze their system architecture * Those new to the field of transactions, learning what's going on. h3. How does it solve these problems? The tool analyses the server log and gathers data on every transaction ran. The tool could also support live updates for a server that is still running. The tool assumes that it can gather all its information from log statements. If it can't, we take the view that some logging is missing and then add it. We may also want the tool to support different log levels. For example, it may need a log level of TRACE to acquire full knowledge of the system. This may introduce too much of a performance overhead, so we may want to allow the tool to tollerate the reduced information provided by the less verbose log levels. In this case only basic information would be provided. h6. Querying feature The data can be queried to find out specific information. For example, show me all the transactions that rolled back. Given a rolledback transaction, the data should be available to diagnose exactly why it rolledback. Other things you may want to query by: * *Outcome*. Committed, Rolledback, heuristic, etc * *Type*. JTA, JTS, WS-AT, REST-AT, etc * *Duration*. Find all fast or slow transactions * *Inflight*. Show transactions currently inflight * *Stuck*. Inflight transactions that have been running for longer than Xms. * *Recovery*. All transactions that needed to be recovered. h6. Diagnostics The tool could also allow 'profiles' to be plugged in. A 'profile' is responsible for identifying common problems that we see users having. Hopefully these would allow issues to be identified earlier before they are passed further up the support chain. For example, we may create a 'profile' that searches over the data looking for loops or diamonds. Another could be responsible for identifying timeouts and maybe hinting at their cause. These 'profiles' would be created based on community demand. h6. Visualization In order to help architects reason about the system architecture, the tool could produce a visualization of a transaction of interest. A few diagrams should give you an idea of what the tooling could produce: https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-48255-8-20252/TXVisualCommitted%282%29.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-48255-8-20252/310-205/TXVisualCommitted%282%29.png Here we can see that a transaction was begun on Server1. It enlisted a DB and JMS queue locally and invoked a remote service on Server2. A second resource (DB2) was enlisted on Server2. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-48255-8-20253/TXVisualRollback.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-48255-8-20253/310-211/TXVisualRollback.png In this example we can see that the transaction rolled back because DB2 voted rollback. Other possible features: * *Participant types*. Display if the participant is one or two phase aware for JTA/JTS. Display the completion type (Participant/Coordinator) for WS-BA. * *    Resource types*. Whether it's a database or message queue and maybe include the name and version. * *Multiple Transaction Types*. Somehow depict the type of transaction (JTS, WS-AT, REST-AT, etc). * *Display Bridges*. Display when a transaction is bridged from one type to another * *In flight Transactions*. More useful for long running transactions; display the current status of each participant and update the display in real-time as the status changes. * *Recovery Status*. Show which resources crashed and the status of those resources already committed or recovered. h3. Reducing the amount of data It's likely that enabling all the required TRACE logging will generate too large a log, and slow the system down. Therefore to optimize this we could do a number of things: 1. Use Byteman to do the TRACE logging anyway (despite being turned off), for just the items we require 2. Use Byteman to somehow buffer up detailed logging in memory, for all transactions. This  is discarded for committed transactions and dumped to the log for failed transactions. 3. Update Narayana to dump a lot of data when the transaction fails. Same as the Byteman approach, but will be useful for more users. We should also reduce the amount of data held for 'identical' transactions. For example, we may have 1,000's of transactions that follow the same paths, interacting with the same resources. We should simply store this data once along with aggregate data for all the associated transactions. h3. Research Things to look into: *  http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.samples.doc%2Fae%2Fsample_jta.html http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.samples.doc%2Fae%2Fsample_jta.html* IBM seem to have an API for being notified of all completed transactions. *  https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/3/19/log2viz https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/3/19/log2viz *  http://logstash.net/ http://logstash.net/ h3. Example - log grepping Edit the log levels in standalone.xml setting the "com.arjuna" level to TRACE and the CONSOLE logger to TRACE. You'll then see a lot of logging produced by the transaction manager. Here's some interesting messages for different scenarios: h5.

Dev Test Phase: + hardening period + 1 month + ends Sept 6 QE Phase: + begins following September 6 end of Dev Test Phase h1. Tasks *General Tasks* - Provide a permission model, storage and API - Enable configuration of the permission model - Provide operations to retrieve permission meta data - Enforce permissions in core management compoments (mapping of permission model against resources) - Respect permissions  in web console (mapping of permission model against interaction units and use cases) - Respect permissions in CLI (mapping of permission model against command line syntax and use cases) *Component Breakdown* Core Management Compoments * * interface to decision point + information about resource access request + information about user + other information about request (time of day, interface, etc) misc op authorization + basic control over op execution write-attribute/undefine-attribute authorization add op authorization + trick here is cases where certain attributes can't be written ++ my instinct is to reject the add; no sophisticated rules read-attribute authorization read-resource authorization, output control to use response header to indicate content was filtered configuration of our default decision point user info configuration (what data to provide decision point, where to get it) read-resource-access op (an op to learn about user's ability to use API; based on read-resource-description) + uses ++ general information ++ allow caller to disable features that will be non-functional (e.g. buttons for misc ops that are not available) model-reference issues + general issue of resources in a tree being affected by other resources + server groups ++ user has rights to a resource that affects an SG, but not to the SG itself + hosts ++ similar issue ++ twist is host-specific config vs domain-wide config affecting server's on a host + others? + notion: enforce this at domain rollout time? ++ problem: what about an admin-only HC situation? -- no rollout Configuration propagation ++ master HC to slave JMX security + AS domains depend on core security, as they just delegate ++ provide some information about access mechanism + other mbeans ++ what policy? ++ what control point? Web Console + the interface structure doesn't necessarily refelct the model structure ++ i.e. some coarse grained interface compoments rely on a number of resources across the model + distinction between interface structure (interaction units) and DMR payload + suppression of interaction units can only be done if the screens properly bootstrap from the model ++ relates to "read-resource-access" ++ currently not the case and a major change (intended first prototype for AS8) + distinction between logical entities and resource tree structure ++ i.e. /subsystem=datasources is resource tree structure ++ datasource=ExampleDS is a logical entity within the tree structure ++ makes a diference for address pattern matching... + do we support security constraints for logical entities? (can see datasource "Foo" but not datasource "Bar") ++ relates to "model-reference issues". CLI + basic handling of low-level (should be ok) + disable high-level commands in advance? + ls -- high-level equivalent to read-resource Misc issues: sniffing for resources -- request a resource to learn it exists from the failure response h2. Permission Model + Should we aim for a mapping of resources onto a permission model? ++ Do we provide the permission model? ++ For a starting point see:  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47854 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/ManagementLayerAccessControl h1. Resource and Action Attributes The following describes attributes required as inputs to a authorization mechanism, which that mechanism would use to enforce some permission schemes we've heard of. The assumption was the authorization mechanism would be some form of Attribute Based Access Control, although the use of ABAC is not a requirement. The terms "Resource Attributes" and "Action Attributes" is derived from the XACML spec, which notes that "Information security policies operate upon attributes of subjects, the resource, the action and the environment in order to arrive at an authorization decision." This section is concerned with identifying relevant attributes of the management resources toward which an operations is targetted, as well as the relevant attributes of the operation itself. DMR API and Wireformat + separate static security meta data from dynamic runtime headers? ++ static: part of "read-resource-access" ++ dynamic: indication of enforced constraints as part of a DMR response (i.e suppressed elements) h4. Scheme 1: Monitor: -- read-only flag on the operation Configurator: -- Storage flag on attribute -- flag on operation to indicate runtime-only -- "security privileged" flag attribute -- "security privileged" flag on resource -- attribute value is a vault expression? Operator: -- Storage flag on attribute -- flag on operation to indicate runtime-only -- "security privileged" flag attribute -- "security privileged" flag on resource -- attribute value is a vault expression? Administrator -- resource address Deployer -- resource address Admin Security Manager -- I would consider the equivalent for us to be the ability to configure the access control policies -- resource address Auditor -- resource address h4. Scheme 2: Anonymous -- N/A Admin -- none; user is root Deployer seems equivalent to Scheme 3's read-write -- "security privileged" flag attribute -- "security privileged" flag on resource -- attribute value is a vault expression? Operator -- read-only flag on the operation -- resource-address -- operation name -- "security privileged" flag attribute -- "security privileged" flag on resource -- attribute value is a vault expression? Monitor -- read-only flag on the operation -- "security privileged" flag attribute -- "security privileged" flag on resource -- attribute value is a vault expression? h4. Scheme 3: Read-only -- read-only flag on the operation -- "security privileged" flag attribute -- "security privileged" flag on resource -- attribute value is a vault expression? Read-write -- "security privileged" flag attribute -- "security privileged" flag on resource -- attribute value is a vault expression? Privileged -- none; user is root This is basically equivalent to Scheme 2, without Scheme 2's "Operator". h4. Scheme 4: Administrator view or modify anything; deploy apps, perform lifecycle functions -- none; user is root Deployer view anything, deploy apps, perform lifecycle functions -- read-only flag on the operation -- resource-address -- operation name Operator view anything, perform lifecycle -- read-only flag on the operation -- resource-address -- operation name Monitor view anything -- read-only flag on the operation</body>

    <body>Hi Friends, We have licensed version of JBOSS called jboss-eap version 5.1 in production environment for our project. We are planning to use JBPM in our project for development and QA environment. We are planning to use BRMS in our production environment( as JBPM is not licensed one) once the development is completed in JBPM. My question here is if we want to use BRMS (licenced version) should we pay seperately for BRMS or  Is jboss-eap 5.1 license enough to use BRMS? Could you please clarify on the above questions?</body>

    <body>Two more thoughts to add: - 1 - Operations that go on to other things i.e. if an operation updates other attributes or calls other operations does it automatically have access or still perform access control check as the user? i.e. May want to stop a user from modifying indivudal attributes but let them call an operation that updates multiple at once. 2 - Pre-flight checks will be good but still need to consider the request may still fail authorization. A users group membership may not be static. Permissions on the server could be updated.</body>

    <body>h1. h1. Objective By early September to implement a simplified domain management access control solution (administrative security) suitable for both AS 8 and EAP 6.x. The primary objective is to establish a simple set of roles with which users can be associated, with clear sets of operation execution permissions associated with each role. The second critical objective is to develop an architecture for authorization that will allow for a much more generic/flexible authorization scheme to be implemented in future releases without breaking the simple scheme we do now. Actually providing a generic scheme is out of scope for AS 8. h1.

    <body>Thoughts on model-references. I'm going to outline different types of references, with suggestions for what rules could be enforced. What I'm getting at here is if we allow a more narrowly scoped variant of our standard roles (e.g. a person is an "Operator" but only for server-group "foo" or only for server host=x/server=y), how would those scoped permissions relate to other resources? Specifically for a given reference: Referrer to referent: a) does referrer need perms to validate existence of the referent? b) do rights to the referrer grant rights to the referent? For example, ability to write to referrer grants right to write referent Referent to referrer: a) does user require perms to referrer to change referent? b) do rights to the referent grant rights to the referrer? For example, ability to write to referent grants right to write referrer The types of references I considered and the answers I have have for the above questions: Misc references: Example: ejb to ispn cache Referrer to referent: a) no b) no Referent to referrer: a) no b) no References to secure resources: Example: remoting connector to security domain cache Referrer to referent: a) yes b) no Referent to referrer: a) no b) no Server group to profile: Referrer to referent: a) no b) configurable (config for a server-group-scoped role could have a flag) Referent to referrer: a) yes b) no Server group to socket-binding-group: Referrer to referent: a) no b) configurable Referent to referrer: a) yes b) no Server group to deployment: Referrer to referent: a) no b) configurable Referent to referrer: a) yes b) no Server group to deployment-override: Referrer to referent: a) no b) configurable Referent to referrer: a) yes b) no Server to server-group: Referrer to referent: a) no b) no (give user rights to server-group if this is desired) Referent to referrer: a) no b) no Server to socket-binding-group: Referrer to referent: a) no b) no Referent to referrer: a) no b) no I went through a bunch of different cases with the server-group and server ones, but for each type, the answers are the same.</body>

    <body>Reading through your examples again, I think this one shouldn't be supported: If you don't have the same rights on both ends (which is what the sentence implies) it should be considered an illegal constraint and access to the the referent not be granted.

  <mail>
    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Access control	notes</header>
    <body>Let's be concrete. If I have the right to *write* the "security-domain" attribute on a remoting subsystem connector resource, that does not require me as a user to have any rights to the security domain resource other than being able to be aware of its existence. It can be argued that I should also be required to have the ability to fully read the resource as well, although fundamentally it's the remoting subsystem code that needs that, not me as a user. In no way does it require that I be able to *write* to the security domain resource. So, I disagree that the same rights are required on both ends. I'm not so sure that even rights to a referent are black-and-white when it comes to rights to a referrer. Just because I can read a security domain config doesn't mean I can read the config of every resource that references it. Perhaps I should be able to see all references so I know what's affected by the resource. I'm going to think about this in terms of something more exact. That is, what exact permissions are we talking about on each side. For example "write" permission to a referent results in modifying the effective config of a referrer, and a permission to do that is necessary, but that's a different thing from a permission to write some other attribute of the referrer.</body>

    <body>For a standalone server, the security-subsystem leaks out to management security via this: https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/build/src/main/resources/docs/schema/jboss-as-config_2_0.xsd#L513 https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/build/src/main/resources/docs/schema/jboss-as-config_2_0.xsd#L513 Basically, the management security realm can delegate to a JAAS security domain configured in the subystem.

  <mail>
    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Access control	notes</header>
    <body>we just need to be clear about the distinction between application level security and domain level security. lack of separation leads to the question how the access control for different roles (i.e. operator vs admin security manager) can be realized. an operator should be able to modify the application level security but prevented from accessing the domain level security. now if evething resides with the secuirty subsystem, we would either need very fine grained access control rules or a strict separation. My gut feeling tells the later is more comprehensible.</body>

    <body>I can understand your point if view. IMO it depends on the question which use cases have precendence. I.e. think about a blank server configuration. Taken your example of a security domain and a remoting connector, you wold need to configure both ends. In this scenario I think we would agree that same rights on both ends (write access) are probably required. The example that you used builds on the assumption that one end is already configured. Precendence of use cases would mean that the foremost example will used to guide the design, not the later. The question is not what are the minimum security requirements, but what are permission are required at maximum. With regard to this I still believe, that whenever a reference is used as part of the configuration you'd require the same permissions on both ends to enable the full set of use cases that we can think of. IMO for reference this includes creation and removal of the the refernt in all cases. Does that make sense?</body>

    <body>"Ideally it should be the location of all security configuration. I do encourage moving the configuration to the security subsystem." The security subsystem is not available within the host controller process - this is the reason we can not use the security subsystem for domain management.  Having some form of subsystem support in the host controller is part of the much longer term plan - at that point yes re-using the subsystem will be desirable to ensure a unified security configuration across the whole AS but as it stands today moving the items to it is just not practical. Once subsystem support is available it would also be desirable to re-use the web susbystem to take advantage of any additional config there as well. This is horrible for threaded discussions - any chance we could move this to a mail thread?</body>

    <body>Another option could be. Split the JAAS configuration portion of the security subsystem into it's own schema.  Reference it from both the as config schema and the security subsystem schema and modify the portion of the security subsystem that operates on this to be able to parse these elements when defined in the security subsystem AND within a security realm.  That way instead of referencing the domain we could just define the login module stack directly in the realm. Using JAAS in the host controller has been problematic as well so would solve that problem for some users.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Access control	notes</header>
    <body>The fundamental difference between a couple of the role schemes we've looked at is how they deal with permissions for security privileged resources. Basically there are two variants: 1) An admininistrator role that effectively is root. 2) A split-responsibility setup, where there is an Administrator role that can deal with application level security, and an Admin Security Manager role that deals with administrative security. The rationale for the split-responsibility setup is different parts of an organization deal may deal with application level security versus administrative security; e.g. the application teams will deal with the former while core IT will deal with the latter. Some questions are: 1) Do we want to support separate roles for application level security vs administrative security? 2) If we do, can support for this be deferred to a subsequent iteration of this feature? 3) If we do, what changes are required to the underlying AS to allow a meaningful separation of the roles? The first question is open for discussion. I'll address the second in a later post. This post is focused on the 3rd. The way WildFly currently works, we cannot enforce a valid separation between application security management and core administrative security management. There are two basic issues: 1) Application-level security constructs (i.e. security domains in the security subsystem) leak into core administrative security via the ability to configure a core security-realm resource to delegate to a JAAS security domain configured in the subsystem. 2) Core security constructs leak into application security via a couple paths: a) Ability to reference core security realms from security subsystem security domains. b) Ability to reference a core security realm from a remoting subsystem connector. (There's also a twist where a managed domain server can be configured to use a remoting subsystem endpoint for it's management connection back to its Host Controller. I need to untangle the implications of that.) In a discussion with Darran and Heiko today, we discussed the following possible tasks for resolving these problems: A) Remove the need for referencing security subsystem security domains from the core security realm by adding support to security realms for the configuration elements currently only available via security domains (login modules etc). B) Remove the need for referencing core security realms from subsystem resources by adding the ability to configure security realms within the security subsystem. This would allow a clean separation between administrative security and application security. This direction would be contrary to a stated goal of doing everything in a security subsystem. However the intent would be the configuration elements would be consistent (with most code shared as well). Even with everything in a single security subsystem, if a clean separation of application security from administrative security is a valid long term requirement, the configuration of that single subsystem would have to have some construct to reflect that separation. Following this approach does not allow us to require incompatible changes in this first iteration of the feature. So, an existing config with references between core security realms and subsystem resources will have to still be supported. However, it is not required that we support configuring the new access control features with such a configuration. It is reasonable to require users who wish to enable access control to update their configs to use the new configuration options mentioned above. Enforcing this would lead to a 3rd task: C) Detect cases where access control is configured but the config uses legacy model reference that blur the lines between administrative security and application security. Reject such configurations. Thanks, Heiko, for driving the discussion that showed the need to clarify all this. Thoughts, everyone?</body>

    <body>Now for the second question: If we want to have a god-like role, then any "split" can be deferred from this iteration. We add the god-like role for this first iteration, and then in a later iteration we add a new role with only application level security permissions. Possibly we could add a 3rd with only administrative security permissions, if that was a valid use case. A twist on this is the "Auditor" role notion. An Auditor role is someone with read-only access to everything, but is the only person with access to the administrative audit resources. This approach ensures that a god-like administrator still has someone to watch over him/her. I don't think having an Auditor role either now or in the future precludes having an otherwise god-like Administrator role in the first iteration.</body>

Below are the stpes that i follwed. 1) Created Sample JBPM project and exported that project into jar file 2) Created Dynamic web project with sample Servlet and placed Sample JBPM jar into lib folder. a) Created object for ProcessMain class in Servlet class b) Calling the ProcessMain method to start the process. 3) Created a war file from the Dynamic web project and placed inside the Jboss RTRA instance 4) Placed required jars in Jboss ../jboss-eap-5.1.0\jboss-eap-5.1\jboss-as\server\RTRA\lib 4) Started the server once server starts servlet will be invoked and call the ProcessMain method to start the process but i am getting the below Error 2013/04/25_14:18.44.960 381091 ERROR [STDERR] (main:) java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to instantiate service for Class 'org.drools.compiler.BPMN2ProcessProvider' 2013/04/25_14:18.44.961 381092 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.drools.util.ServiceRegistryImpl.get(ServiceRegistryImpl.java:161) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.961 381092 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.drools.compiler.BPMN2ProcessFactory.loadProvider(BPMN2ProcessFactory.java:29) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.961 381092 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.drools.compiler.BPMN2ProcessFactory.getBPMN2ProcessProvider(BPMN2ProcessFactory.java:21) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.962 381093 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.drools.compiler.BPMN2ProcessFactory.configurePackageBuilder(BPMN2ProcessFactory.java:12) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.962 381093 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.drools.compiler.PackageBuilder.addKnowledgeResource(PackageBuilder.java:476) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.962 381093 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.drools.builder.impl.KnowledgeBuilderImpl.add(KnowledgeBuilderImpl.java:28) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.962 381093 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at com.test.ProcessMain.readKnowledgeBase(ProcessMain.java:28) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.962 381093 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at com.test.ProcessMain.processMain(ProcessMain.java:17) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.962 381093 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at com.test.TestServlet.init(TestServlet.java:17) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.962 381093 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapper.loadServlet(StandardWrapper.java:1048) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.963 381094 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapper.load(StandardWrapper.java:950) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.963 381094 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.loadOnStartup(StandardContext.java:4122) 2013/04/25_14:18.44.963 381094 ERROR [STDERR] (main:)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.start(StandardContext.java:4417) In windows, through eclipse i am able to run the program as stanalone, but in jboss its not working.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Designer characteristics</header>
    <body>[My config - jBPM 5.4.0.Final, Windows Server, 7 and 8. Eclipse Helios and Juno] Where possible I'd like to use Designer in preference to the Eclipse editor but it has a number of features which I'm finding are "spoiling my enjoyment"  :)  and I wondered if they are likely to change in the next release. Please be assured, these are not complaints and my aim is constructive. Here goes: * On my Windows set-up, Script tasks may start life as multi-line text, but always seem to end up being collapsed onto a single line which is awkward to work with.* The Eclipse tools seem to maintain multiline editing but for some reason this isn't the case in Designer. * Is this just a Windows/Unix file-ending issue? (related-  https://community.jboss.org/thread/223637 Problem with designer "losing" newline characters in Script Tasks) * I've not yet been able to import an existing BPMN process using the Designer Import BPMN feature. I can do so using the Eclipse-Drools-Guvnor toolchain but direct import fails, even for diagrams created for jBPM 5.3.* I can export a BPMN file created in Desinger and then reimport it back in, i.e. Designer is able understand it's own output. * (related -  https://community.jboss.org/thread/223567 Guvnor Designer Import BPMN error - "Could not find BPMNDI information") * After a few minutes of use I get a "Local history cleared" pop-up and after that point it appears very frequently and often intrusively. Although I can disable local history, it resets to "on" whenever I save my diagram which I tend to do quite frequently. Again this may be a quirk of my set-up but it quickly gets in the way. * On a more positive note, will we be able to define a template to be used by the automatic user task form generator? The current facility is very useful but it would be even better if I could include layouts specific to my project (company information, in-house styles etc.) My apologies if this feature already exists and I've just missed it! I wondered if these are likely to be addressed in the next release. I'm happy to raise Jira items if that's preferable. Best regards and thanks, Andy McC</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - AS7: Utilising masked passwords via the vault</header>
    <body>As far as I understood the concept, it is safe if used correctly. The keystore should not be located on the server machine. It should only be available to the server on startup. You may place it on a USB-dongle which is removed after complete startup. But you are right in that most people won't do that. On the other hand most people won't need that too.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Layered Distributions and Module Path Organization</header>
    <body>Note to self: The discussion of patching needs updating to reflect the possibility of changes associated solely with the identity, and not just with a layered distribution. An example of this would be product.conf or modules/layers.conf which belong to the identity. Unfortunately, it looks like the contents of the welcome-content dir will fit in this category as well. In AS 8 or later and EAP 7 hopefully we can move our default content into modules and reserve the welcome-content dir for user-provided content (or remove it altogether).</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Narayana	Release Process</header>
    <body>This page provides a list of instructions that must be done *in order* when doing a release of Narayana. h2. Check JIRA 1. Check all issues resolved. 2. Create next point release version if not exists - this is so you can push issues in step 3 below. 3. Unresolved issues should be resolved or pushed. h2. Check Hudson Ensure no test failures in the group of hudson tests, for the branch you intend to release. h2. Raise AS7 component upgrade request in Jira Prepare for a PR to update AS7. 1.  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7 2. create a new 'component update' issue.1. Ensure the module is set to 'transactions' 2. select an appropriate 'fix for'. 3. Assign it to yourself. h2. Do Release h3. Git Branches (4.17 and 5 only) Must be done first as the build-release-packages.xml relies on the tag being available cd $NARAYAN_SRC/scripts pre-release.sh &lt;next version, e.g: 5.0.0.M3&gt; h3. Create the AS7 pull request branch and roll the jbosstm/jboss-as branch to next SNAPSHOT (UN-TESTED COMMANDS!!) BRANCH=4_BRANCH AS_BRANCH=master JIRA=AS7-5815 CURRENT=4.17.2.Final NEXT=4.17.3.Final git clone git at github.com:jbosstm/jboss-as.git cd jboss-as git checkout $BRANCH git remote add upstream git://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as.git git pull --rebase --ff-only upstream $AS_BRANCH sed -i "s/$CURRENT-SNAPSHOT/$CURRENT/g" pom.xml git commit -am "Upgrade Narayana to $CURRENT" # should use git merge-base $BRANCH upstream/master # You will need to resolve som merge conflicts. Most likely around version numbers. git rebase -i HEAD~10 git checkout $BRANCH sed -i "s/$CURRENT/$NEXT-SNAPSHOT/g" pom.xml git commit -am "Upgrade Narayana to $NEXT-SNAPSHOT" git push origin $BRANCH h2.

Push Upstream Check that the pull request will work. *If it doesn't and it requires Narayana changes you *have* to rev the version number - DON'T attempt to re-release with the same version number:* JIRA=AS7-5815 CURRENT=4.17.2.Final git clone  mailto:git at github.com git at github.com:jbosstm/jboss-as.git cd jboss-as rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/jboss/jbossts rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/jboss/narayana ./build.sh clean install 1. Raise the pull request using our branch 2. Once merged, resolve the AS7 Jira issue. h2. JIRA Release 1. Close all issues for the release 2. Mark as released (Need admin permissions) h2. Update Website Update the Narayana community site: * Fix the Magnolia files* Open the website.jbosstm.documentation.4.16.5.Final.xml and website.jbosstm.downloads.4.16.5.Final.xml files * Edit the first line to change '&lt;sv:node sv:name="5.0.0.M2"' to replace the '.' with '_'.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Sharing jbpmContext with two different threads on jBPM3</header>
    <body>Hello everynone. My first post. I think I read every post about the jBpmContext and nothing gave me the solution... I'm using jBPM 3 with SEAM. I launch an asynchronous event which launches a ProcessInstance. I am using another asynchronous event to cancel the previously launched ProcessInstance. @Observer("builderObserver") .... @Observer("cancelBuilderObserver") ... But when I do jbpmConfig.getCurrentJbpmContext(); the value is null. It is probably due to different transactions. I just want to be able to end a processInstance using its id. Could you please help me? Thanks.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Remote Debugging for Eclipse Test Plug-in Running by Tycho</header>
    <body>When I report issue in bug tracking system about nightly build's JUnit test error I usually get simple answer that it is supposed to be working  because it is working on developer's workstation. After that routine conversation starts and it turns out that tests were running from development environment under Eclipse. Here I usually have to explain again and again that's not the same running tests from development environment and in build. The right way to make yourself sure your tests will work in most cases without errors in nightly build is to start tests the same way as nightly build does. It was not easy for JBoss Tools tests until we created experimental branch and switched to Maven Tycho project. That means it is fairly easy to run tests now. Basically you need to change current directory and execute maven install goal. If it runs in development environment and in maven your tests are good and in most cases it should be fine in nightly build. Problems begin if it runs in development environment but it doesn't in maven. In this scenario you need to debug tests running in Tycho somehow and fix it. Fortunately it can be done using Java remote debugging support. First of all you need to be sure you have built your sources you're going to debug and there is no differences between .java and  .class files. If you're going find problem from previous build just get right tagged version and build it before debugging session. There are two options to use remote debugger 1. Simple use of *-DdebugPort=8001* or what ever port you would like to use 2. Add full argLine for remote debugging configuration im pom.xml h1. Use debugPort system property (Recommended) To use this just add *-DdebugPort=&lt;portNumber&gt;* to your maven command line replacing &lt;portNumber&gt; for desired port and make sure you have the same port configured in your Remote Java Application configuration in Eclipse Debug Configuration dialog as it explained for second option below. h1. Or use Full argLine for Remote Debugging Configuration in pom.xml (Deprecated) Open pom.xml for your Eclipse Test Plug-in and add Java VM arguments like it shown below (actual port numbers, server names and  other parameters may be different, it depends from your environment) &lt;build&gt; &lt;plugins&gt; &lt;plugin&gt;     &lt;groupid&gt;org.sonatype.tycho&lt;/groupid&gt;        &lt;artifactid&gt;maven-osgi-test-plugin&lt;/artifactid&gt;        &lt;configuration&gt;             &lt;argLine&gt;-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8001,server=y,suspend=y&lt;/argLine&gt;        &lt;/configuration&gt;     &lt;/plugin&gt; &lt;/plugins&gt; &lt;/build&gt; This snipped configured for remote debugging in OpenJDK 6, if your is different you might need to read  #r1 [1] and configure it right for your JVM version. Configure java projects with sources you're going to debug in Eclipse and create Remote Java Application configuration in Eclipse Debug Configuration dialog. Fill 'host' and 'port' fields with the same values from pom.xml argLine element. Press Apply button to save your changes and start your test plug-in from terminal like $mvn install It will go through build process and finally you ll see something like [INFO] Expected eclipse log file: /home/eskimo/Projects/jbt-modular/jst/tests/org.jboss.tools.jst.web.kb.test/target/work/data/.metadata/.log [INFO] Command line: /bin/sh -c cd /home/eskimo/Projects/jbt-modular/jst/tests/org.jboss.tools.jst.web.kb.test &amp;&amp; /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java -Dosgi.noShutdown=false -Dosgi.os=linux -Dosgi.ws=gtk -Dosgi.arch=x86 -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8001,server=y,suspend=y -jar /home/eskimo/.m2/repository/p2/osgi/bundle/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher/1.0.201.R35x_v20090715/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher-1.0.201.R35x_v20090715.jar -data /home/eskimo/Projects/jbt-modular/jst/tests/org.jboss.tools.jst.web.kb.test/target/work/data -dev file:/home/eskimo/Projects/jbt-modular/jst/tests/org.jboss.tools.jst.web.kb.test/target/dev.properties -install /home/eskimo/Projects/jbt-modular/jst/tests/org.jboss.tools.jst.web.kb.test/target/work -configuration /home/eskimo/Projects/jbt-modular/jst/tests/org.jboss.tools.jst.web.kb.test/target/work/configuration -application org.codehaus.tycho.surefire.osgibooter.uitest -testproperties /home/eskimo/Projects/jbt-modular/jst/tests/org.jboss.tools.jst.web.kb.test/target/surefire.properties Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 8001 At this point build is waiting for you to attach remote debugger to the process because of using suspend=y in argLine element of your pom.xml file. So you need to return to eclipse and hit 'Debug' button in dialog opened before. Build will continue at this point and stop on your break points so you can find out what is wrong with tests during nightly build.

Words of Warning When building and debugging your code locally, be aware that your eclipse environment or target platform inside the running eclipse should match the environment used to launch your tests. When running locally via the *mvn clean verify* command, tycho will default to using a MINIMUM configuration for both building AND testing your code. To ensure the code is compiled, and tests are launched, against a SPECIFIC target platform, make sure to use the *-Pminimum or * *-Pmaximum* flags in your build command. When debugging from within eclipse, if your current environment does NOT match the environment tycho uses to launch your tests, you may experience many types of confusing behavior. The most obvious will be if the source code lines do not match up to what is being executed, but other problems such as inaccessible or unhit breakpoints, or illogical code flows, may confuse you for a very long time. If you are running your tests with a *-Pminimum* flag, ensure your eclipse is set up to use that configuration. Similarly, If you are running your tests with a *-Pmaximum* flag, make sure you are using an environment which matches that target platform. This will save you many hours  ;)</body>

    <body>Hi all! It was a long (very long) and difficult (I had to elarn everything from beginning) journey but finaly, I did it! My first android application is alive! And now it's your turn to test it and recommend what to improve (not just technical but also language mistakes!). I tried this app on 4 different emulators (tablet, big screen smartphone, 2 small screen smartphones) and with com.sample.evaluation. But I need real devices and real users. So if this app do something wrong, please tell me what were you doing (refreshing, starting instance, by which process). Here are some things I want to add later: 1. display flipping 2. diagram zoom in and out. 3. in list of instances show instance id as big text and proess id as small (I forgot about it and I don't want to export and sign .apk again with just this change) 4. optimize the s**t out of it. *Here is the .apk file* (and also in attachment) https://dl.dropbox.com/u/24366262/MainActivity.apk https://dl.dropbox.com/u/24366262/MainActivity.apk Just comment below if you want source code, I can post it on GitHub or somewhere. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-803704-20465/login.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-803704-20465/310-428/login.png screen 1: log in. first, you have to set up server (menu-&gt;set up server), then, you can log in. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-803704-20466/process.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-803704-20466/310-445/process.png screen 2: list of processes (well, process in this case), with opened Menu.

Does any one have an example war file I could take a look at, deploy locally? I could not get mysql working with the sample evaluation example working there was no start.demo.db task for eaxmple so I dont even have the tables installed in mydql.  I'm not sure how the persistnce stuff hangs toegther with task servers and process persistance.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Getting Node Name from Node Instance in jBPM 5.4</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm trying to get the node name for a process that at a given moment has a gateway making two tasks active simultaneasly. The problem is that when I get the NodeInstance collection it seems that it is not iterating correctly, when I use a do/while with a hasNext I enter a infinite loop and only one NodeName is obtained. Then I changed it for using size, and although the size is correct (in my case size is 2) the getNameName method always returns the same node name as if the iterator was always in the same place. Can you help me on this? Here is the code: The result of this code is: Number of nodes - 2 Digitalize Document - 0 Digitalize Document - 1 Instead of: Number of nodes - 2 Digitalize Document - 0 Insert data - 1 Thank you</body>

    <body>Yes, the sample install scripts are out of date since we changed the module path.   Thanks for bringing that to my attention. You have a couple of options.   You can change the value of the web.xml context param to myfaces-2.1.10 or you can change the default impl in the jsf subsystem.  Since you've apparently removed the defaault "main" impl and you've only got myfaces installed, you should change the default impl anyway. /subsystem=jsf/:write-attribute(name=default-jsf-impl-slot,value=myfaces-2.1.10) Then you don't need to declare org.jboss.jbossfaces.JSF_CONFIG_NAME in your web.xml.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Portal Development] - JBoss : create	custom roles</header>
    <body>Hi, I am working on a JBoss portal containing several pages. These pages and the user having acces to these pages are define in the "...-object.xml" (using the &lt;portal&gt; =&gt; &lt;page&gt; =&gt; &lt;security-constraint&gt; =&gt; &lt;policy-permission&gt; =&gt; &lt;role-name&gt;) Now I would like to modify this, in order for an administrateur to create a custom role from the application, without modifying the code and its xml. So instead of defining which role has access to each page in the "....-object.xml", I would like to define it in my database. I saw that I can set the &lt;role-name&gt; to &lt;unchecked/&gt; so every role has access to the page, but how can I then write in the code the differences of interface between users right and view? Do you know if it is possible to hide/show different pages (so tabs, inside the application) depending on the database data of the user using JBoss? Thank you, Grinn</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [Clustering Development] - mod_cluster SSL setup/implementation (JBoss AS --&gt; httpd)</header>
    <body>Hi, I have little problems with how the password attribute of the ssl element in the JBoss AS7 modcluster subsystem is used. Let's say we already have a truststore defined using system properties: &lt;system-properties&gt; &lt;property name="javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword" value="mypasswd"/&gt; &lt;/system-properties&gt; In addition I have different keystores for the client certificates with different passwords. If the password is used in the subsystem config, ModClusterSubsystemAdd.java (as shown below) will overwrite my settings which will lead to exceptions b/c my truststore cannot be read anymore. This fact gives me two options: 1. I will set a password in the ssl element This means I have to duplicate my already existing CA truststore and use the same password I am using for my client certificate keystore. 2. I do not set a password. My truststore can be read w/o modification, BUT my keystore has to use the default "changeit" password which needs considering due to security implications. This is in ModClusterConfig.java What I'd like to discuss is: 1. Guard the truststore password set in ModClusterSubsystemAdd.java 2. use the javax.net.ssl.keyStore* system properties like it's done for the javax.net.ssl.trustStore* ones What do you think?

    <body>A deployment scanner is quite a complex beast, particularly if you support exploded deployments. The code for ours is in  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/tree/master/deployment-scanner https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/tree/master/deployment-scanner particularly  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/deployment-scanner/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/server/deployment/scanner/FileSystemDeploymentService.java https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/deployment-scanner/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/server/deployment/scanner/FileSystemDeploymentService.java. That's all heavily dependent on the java.io.File API though, so to borrow from that and use an HTTP store would be a significant change. It also has a lot of logic related to the marker files we use. That could be omitted if you don't deal with exploded deployments. The biggest thing you can get out of that code is how it uses the core management APIs to actually do the deployment actions. These are the same things the CLI does under the covers.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - AS 7 Internal	Architecture Overview</header>
    <body>h2. High Level Overview At a coarse level, AS 7 consists of two main elements: * A core manageable service container based on modular classloading * Extensions to that core that provide the kind of functionality most users associate with an application server, like handling HTTP requests and managing transactions The AS distribution also includes two clients for the management interfaces it exposes (a CLI tool and a web-based admin console). The AS codebase also produces implementations of the SPIs published by the Arquillian project, allowing AS7 servers to run Arquillian-based tests. h3. AS Core The core of the AS consists of the following primary elements: * A modular classloading system provided by the jboss-modules library * A fast, highly scalable service container framework provided by the jboss-msc library * An extensible management layer that is meant to mediate access to the service container by logic that wants to add, remove and modify services. The management layer also provides a consistent, persistent, configuration model for the AS. The management layer involves* core elements, via the jboss-dmr library and the AS codebase's own controller, controller-client, deployment-repository, domain-management and network modules as well as parts of the server module * remote management capability via the protocol and domain-http modules * multi-server managed domains via the process-controller and host-controller modules * miscellaneous elements provided via the managment-client-content and platform-mbean modules * A deployment framework for coordinating installation of deployment content into the runtime. This is one of the things provided by the server module. h3. AS Extensions Most of the functionality that end users associate with an application server is provided AS extensions. Most of the modules in the AS7 codebase are extension implementations, with each extension providing a coherent set of functionality. Many extensions provide support for some aspect of the Java EE specifications. Extensions implement an interface (org.jboss.as.controller.Extension) that allows integration with the core AS management layer. Via that mechanism, extensions are able to * participate in the parsing and marshalling of the AS's configuration documents * register resources and operations to be exposed via the AS's management API * install services into the AS's service container * register deployment unit processors with the AS's deployment framework See the " https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Extending+JBoss+AS+7 Extending JBoss AS 7" document for more on extensions. See also  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 for more on how extending AS 7 differs from extending previous versions of JBoss AS. h2. AS7 Boot Process To better illustrate the AS 7 architecture, let's walk through the boot process for a standalone server. h3. Primordial Boot When you run bin/standalone.sh from the root of the AS 7 distribution, the final effect is to launch a JVM using the following essential command java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone If you start the AS and use the ps command to see the actual JVM launch command, you'll see a lot of JVM settings (-Xmx and the like) and a lot of system property settings, but the above bits are the key information. Let's break that down a bit: java -jar jboss-modules.jar We can see from this that the actual main class the VM will invoke isn't in a JBoss AS library at all; it's in jboss-modules.jar (specifically, the org.jboss.modules.Main class.) So, when you start the AS the first thing you are doing is setting up a modular classloading environment. -mp modules These are arguments passed to org.jboss.modules.Main.main(). The -mp is short for "module path" and the value is a path somewhat analogous to the value of an OS $PATH environment variable. Each item in the path is a location under which jboss-modules will look for a module when needed. If there is more than one item in the path, the items are searched in order, with the search ending as soon as the module is found. In this case there is only one item in the path -- the modules/ dir under the AS distribution root. org.jboss.as.standalone This is the name of a module located on the module path. This module will be loaded by jboss-modules. If you look in the modules/org/jboss/as/standalone/main/module.xml file in the AS distribution, you will see it includes this element: &lt;main-class name="org.jboss.as.server.Main"/&gt; When jboss-modules sees that element in the module.xml for the module passed to its main() method, it knows to load the specified class and to pass any remaining command line arguments into +its+ main() method. So, now we have a modular classloading enviroment set up, and the org.jboss.as.server.Main.main() method (found in the AS codebase's server module) has been invoked. The org.jboss.as.server.Main.main() method does a number of things, but two are most relevant for people who wish to understand how to develop the AS: * Any remaining command line arguments are processed and an instance of the ServerEnvironment is created. This object encapsulates environmental information available via the command line or system properties; things like where the root of the AS dist is; where the root of the server instance is; where the configuration file is, etc. Later this information is made available to all services in the system via the ServerEnvironmentService. * An object implementing the Bootstrap interface (specifically, the org.jboss.as.server.BootstrapImpl class) is created  and configured and its bootstrap() method is invoked. h3. Service-based Boot The most important thing BootstrapImpl does is create an instance of the JBoss MSC library's ServiceContainer interface. A service container manages a set of running services. A service is simply a thing that can be started and stopped, with start and stop performed via methods specified in the JBoss MSC Service interface. A service also exposes a value of some type T via the Service interface's public T getValue() method. The value type T specified by the service is used by default by consumers of the service, and should represent the public interface of the service. It may or may not be the same as the implementing type of the service. The ServiceContainer provides an API for managing services -- configuring and installing them, removing them, triggering start and stop, looking up already installed services, etc. Configuring a service can involve expressing the dependencies the service has on other services and asking that the service container inject the value of depended-upon services into the service before starting it. If a service depends upon another service, that other service must be successfully started before the service container will invoke the dependent service's start method. If for some reason the depended-upon service needs to be stopped, the service container will invoke the dependent service's stop method first. The ServiceContainer maintains an internal thread pool. In order to achieve highly performant management of large numbers of inter-related services, activities related to starting and stopping services are performed as a series of concisely scoped tasks, with the threads in the thread pool used to execute those tasks. For example, executing a service's start method would be a task performed by a thread in the ServiceContainer's thread pool. Because of this fact, +it is important to recognize that any activity related to starting and stopping services will be highly multi-threaded. For example, you can never assume that the thread that asks the service container to install a service will be the thread that calls its start method.+ So, at this point in our boot, we have in place two of the four main architectural elements discussed in the "AS Core" section of the "High Level Overview" above: a modular classloading environment provided by the jboss-modules library, and a service container framework provided by the jboss-msc library. Up to this point in the AS boot, all activity has been on a single thread, the JVM's main thread. In the BootstrapImpl.bootstrap() method, things get more interesting, since much of the remaining boot work involves installing services, with the ServiceContainer's thread pool threads doing the most of that work. BootstrapImpl.bootstrap() installs two services: * ControlledProcessStateService. This service provides access to a simple enum value showing the current running state of the server (STARTING, STOPPING, RUNNING, RESTART_REQUIRED, RELOAD_REQUIRED). This is the only service that once started should not be stopped until the VM is being shut down. * ApplicationServerService. This is the root service for the application server; all other services in one way or another depend upon it. When you use the CLI to perform the :reload operation, the server handles that request by telling the service container to stop this service, which has the effect of stopping all other services that depend upon it. Then once it is stopped, the service container is told to start the service again. The ApplicationServerService starts a number of other services in its start method. The most significant of these is the ServerService. h3. The ServerService and the Controller Boot Thread ServerService brings in the 3rd and 4th of the four primary components of the core AS listed in the "High Level Overview" above -- the extensible management layer and the deployment framework. For those of you familiar with the " https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Extending+JBoss+AS+7 Extending JBoss AS 7" document, ServerService performs many of the same kinds of activities an Extension implementation performs in its initialize(ExtensionContext context) method, but for the core AS management model: * registers resource definitions, attribute definitions and OperationStepHandlers for the core AS managed resources * registers core DeploymentUnitProcessors ServerService implements Service&lt;ModelController&gt;. A ModelController is the central execution point for management operations in a managed AS process (i.e. a server or a HostController in a managed domain.) In its start method, ServerService spawns a separate thread, the "Controller Boot Thread", which is responsible for coordinating the remainder of the boot. It does the following primary tasks * Triggers the parsing of the server configuration file (e.g. standalone.xml) into a list of management operations that should be executed by the ModelController to bring the server's running configuration in line with the xml configuration * Passes those management operations into the ModelController's execute method. The ModelController uses the Controller Boot Thread to handle execution of many of the steps involved in handling those operations. * Blocks until all services added into the runtime as part of handling those management ops have either started or failed to start. * Logs the completion of boot. The tasks of the Controller Boot Thread are spelled out in further detail below. h4. XML Parsing, Extension Loading, Extension Parsing Initialization The task of an XML parser for an AS7 configuration document (e.g. standalone.xml, domain.xml, host.xml) is to populate a list of management operations that should be executed by the ModelController to bring the process' running configuration in line with the xml. Each of those management operations has the same format as would be read off the wire if the CLI had sent an operation request to the server to invoke an equivalent operation. The parser for the core AS xml namespace has some special behavior when it comes to parsing an &lt;extension&gt; element in the xml: * The name attribute of the element is the name of a JBoss Modules module that contains an implementation of the org.jboss.as.controller.Extension interface * Once the name is parsed, the parser asks JBoss Modules to load the module * Once the module is loaded, the java.lang.ServiceLoader mechanism is used to load the module's implementation of the Extension interface. * The initializeParsers(ExtensionParsingContext context) method on that Extension implementation is invoked. That allows the extension to register XML parsers for the XML namespaces supported by the subsystem(s) the extension provides. * When the core AS xml parser subsequently encounters a &lt;subsystem&gt; element in the configuration document, the xml namespace of the element is determined, and the appropriate parser registered by some Extension is used to parse that portion of the document. h4. Execution of Boot Management Operations, Extension Initialization Once xml parsing is complete, a list of management operations is ready for execution by the ModelController. Each operation has the same format (address, operation name, parameters) as would be read off the wire if the CLI had sent an operation request to the server to invoke an equivalent operation after boot. The Controller Boot Thread asks the ModelController to execute the operations as a unit, with each individual operation acting as a step in the overall unit of work. Execution proceeds in 3 stages, with all steps in the overall unit completing a stage before execution on the next stage begins. (This execution pattern applies whenever any operation or atomic list of operations is invoked, not just during boot.) * Stage MODEL -- the OperationStepHandler registered for each operation makes necessary updates to the server's internal configuration model, and, if necessary, registers a handler for the same operation for Stage RUNTIME. * Stage RUNTIME -- any OperationStepHandler registered in Stage MODEL for an operation accesses the JBoss MSC ServiceContainer and installs/removes/updates any relevant services. The ServiceContainer has its own thread pool and uses it to perform the necessary tasks to start and stop services. The thread executing the OperationStepHandler does not do this directly, and the handler implementation needs to recognize that service start/stop will be asynchronous. * Stage VERIFY -- A Stage.MODEL or Stage.RUNTIME handler can register a Stage.VERIFY handler that will only run once the ServiceContainer had completed all service modifications made in stage RUNTIME. A VERIFY handler can check that the runtime service changes completed successfully. Before the list of boot operations is passed into the ModelController, a check is done for operations that add extension resources (for example, using CLI syntax, /extension=org.foo.extension:add.) When one is found, the relevant Extension implementation's initialize(ExtensionContext context) method is invoked. This gives the Extension a chance to register its resource and attribute definitions and its OperationStepHandlers with the core AS management layer before the boot operations are executed. h4. Wait for Service Container Stability and Boot Completion The final steps in the AS 7 boot are to wait while the JBoss MSC ServiceContainer processes the installation and start of all the services added by the handlers for the boot operations. As discussed in the introduction to the ServiceContainer above, the start of services is performed by threads in the ServiceContainer's internal thread pool. Services are not started by the Controller Boot Thread. However, the ServerService attaches a listener to the controller object for each service; using this the ServerService is able to track when all services have reached a stable state. The Controller Boot Thread uses this facility to block until the ServiceContainer has stabilized. At that point, all services are either started or failed, and boot is nearly complete. The Controller Boot Thread switches the state of the ControlledProcessState service from STARTING to RUNNING, writes a log message reporting that the boot is complete, and boot is finished. h2. Deployment Processing When you trigger deployment of some content, one of the management operations supported by the core AS management layer is invoked. The logic responsible for handling that operation will extract relevant information from the operation request (e.g. the name of the deployment) and will then install services into the AS's service container: * A Service&lt;VirtualFile&gt; implementation that provides an org.jboss.vfs.VirtualFile that represents the deployment content. * A Service&lt;DeploymentUnit&gt; (in this case RootDeploymentUnitService) that provides a DeploymentUnit for the deployment. A DeploymentUnit retains data which is persistent for the life of the deployment, and will later be passed into the various DeploymentUnitProcessor implementations that perform various actions to install the runtime services needed by the deployment. The RootDeploymentUnitService has injected into it a reference to all the DeploymentUnitProcessor (DUP) implementations that were registered by the core ServerService at boot or that have been registered by subsystems. The DUP implementations are grouped by the Phase of the deployment process in which they execute, and are numerically ordered within that phase. DeploymentUnitProcessors are organized in a chain fashion, with each DUP performing a limited set of tasks to help take a deployment from being a bunch of bits to being a set of useful services. Deployment proceeds in phases. See the  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/server/deployment/Phase.java Phase enum for a listing of the phases. For each phase, a DeploymentUnitPhaseService representing that phase that is installed into the service container. Each phase service (save the first) depends on the phase service for the previous phase, and each phase service (save the last) in its start method installs the phase service for the next phase. The RootDeploymentUnitService in its start method installs the first phase service, which in turn depends on it the RootDeploymentUnitService. The effect of all this is if the RootDeploymentUnitService is stopped (e.g. by the undeploy management operation), this will trigger a requirement for the service container to first stop the first phase service, which will in turn trigger a requirement to first stop the next phase service, and so on all the way to the final phase service. The effect is the phase services will be stopped in reverse order from how they were started. The primary thing the phase services do in their start and stop methods is invoke the deploy and undeploy methods of each DeploymentUnitProcessor registered for their phase. The deploy method is invoked in phase service start and the undeploy method is invoked in stop. For each deploy/undeploy call the DUP is provided with a DeploymentPhaseContext that provides context to the call and gives the DUP access to the service container, allowing it to install or remove services. h3. Deployment Processing and Modules One of the tasks performed by the DeploymentUnitProcessors is to set up the modular classloading enviroment for the deployment. Each top-level deployment has its own dynamically generated module. For deployment types that include known subdeployments (e.g. an ear can include wars, ejb jars, etc) then in addition those subdeployments also get their own dynamically generated module. What other modules these deployment modules have visibility to depends on the requirements determined by the deployment framework when it analyzes the deployment content (e.g. by parsing deployment descriptors, reading manifests, or scanning annotations.) The key actor in this process is the org.jboss.as.server.deployment.module.ModuleSpecProcessor, which is a DeploymentUnitProcessor. The ModuleSpecProcessor configures and installs an MSC service that interacts with jboss-modules to dynamically generate the deployment's module. Other DeploymentUnitProcessors that execute prior to ModuleSpecProcessor analyze the content of the deployment and add contextual information to the DeploymentUnit that is used by ModuleSpecProcessor to establish what other modules the deployment's module can access. So, for example, a DUP registered by the JPA subsystem might recognize that the deployment requires JPA support (e.g. by detecting the presence of a persistence.xml file) and record that visibility to the modules that provide the JPA APIs should be added. The effect of all this is the deployment's classes have access to an appropriate set of classes located in the AS's own modules or in other deployments, but do not have access to classes located in other modules.</body>

Tools and technologies h2. Java JBoss Tools requires Java 6. Ensure your JRE and JDK are compatible with Java 6 h2. Eclipse PDE/RCP JBoss Tools are a set of plugins for Eclipse. Then get your favourite recent version of Eclipse from here:  http://eclipse.org/downloads/ http://eclipse.org/downloads/ We recommand you using +Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers+. But you can also install PDE in any other installation of Eclipse: https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-18124-6-18511/installPDE.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-18124-6-18511/450-477/installPDE.png h2. Git and EGit Instlall Git CLI, and install EGit in Eclipse (EGit is already provided in most Eclipse installations). h2. m2e m2e (maven integation for Eclipse) is also required. It's recommended that you also install *m2e-tycho* and *m2e-eGit* connector from +Preferences &gt; Maven &gt; Discovery &gt; Open Catalog+. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-18124-6-20251/m2e-tycho.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-18124-6-20251/450-341/m2e-tycho.png h2. Tips for productivity and quality Here are some highly recommanded plugins that will make your more efficient when inside the IDE h3. Install Code Recommanders Provides additional snippets, templates and smart completion. Not intrusive. You can find it on the "Juno" update-site or the current Eclipse release site. h3. Static analysis Static analysis will detect bug very early and will save you minutes of debug every day. Using it will make you and your colleagues happier. It tells you while typing code that you may have a bug. No need to wait for running test or CI reports to detect this. h4. Enable all JDT warnings JDT provides very good static analysis, and can prevent you from writing bugs. You simply have to turn all "ignored" advices to "warning" in Window &gt; Preference &gt; Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Errors/Warning. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-18124-6-18512/jdtWarnings.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-18124-6-18512/450-431/jdtWarnings.png h4. Install Findbugs for Eclipse http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/findbugs-eclipse-plugin http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/findbugs-eclipse-plugin h4. Install PMD for Eclipse http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pmd-eclipse http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pmd-eclipse h3. Coverage Coverage answers to the question "What is tested or net?". JBoss Tools CI builds provide Jacoco reports for coverage by unit tests (file name is jacoco.exec). This file can easily be analyzed inside Eclipse on your Java editor using EclEmma plugin:  http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclemma-java-code-coverage http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclemma-java-code-coverage h1. Get source Each JBoss Tools component is now its own GitHub repo:  https://github.com/jbosstools/ https://github.com/jbosstools/ h2. To work on a specific component The easiest way to get started is to check out source for only the module you wish to work on, and import Java projects from this part of the source tree. Example: * I  want to fix a bug in CDI component of JBT: git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-server.git and import plugins and tests projects from plugns/* and tests/* h1. Set up a target platform *Target Platform = Allowed Dependencies* We provide several TP that have different purpose. We do set up some default TP for development, that you should use. You should use those Target Platforms instead of installing the dependencies in your IDE. Then you IDE becomes "The tools you need to develop" whereas the Target Platform provides the dependencies. Import into your Eclipse workspace JBoss Tools target platforms from GitHub: git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms.git Then select the version you want for the target platform. Those versions are available as tags. You can see the list of tags with git tag -l. Let's say for this example we want the target platform 4.2.0.c. cd jbosstools-target-platforms git checkout 4.2.0.c Then, in Eclipse, +Import &gt; Existing Maven Project+, browse to the +jbosstools-target-platfroms/jbosstools/multiple.+ Double-click on +multiple.target+, and click +Set As Target Platform+ +https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-18124-6-20254/setTp.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-18124-6-20254/450-355/setTp.png + h1. Run JBoss Tools and Tests from your IDE Once Target Platform is configured, you can easily give a try to your plugins using +Run As &gt; Java Application.+ You can also run automated tests from your IDE using +Run As... &gt; JUnit Plugin Tests+.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - TransactionMonitoringAndVisualization</header>
    <body>h1. Transaction Monitoring and Visualization h3. Overview of the Tool The purpose of this project is to create a tool for monitoring the status of in-flight and complete transactions. The main aims of the tool are to help debug transaction related issues and also to provide insight into the running of the system. Essentially, the tool monitors a running system (or a log from a running system) and produces a detailed list of all transactions. A user may then select a particular transaction to see in more detail, including the participants involved in the transaction, the outcome of the transaction and the participants that influenced the outcome. The tool could be visual, showing a diagrammatic view of a transaction or may be command line based, producing a textual output (or maybe both). h3. What Problems does this solve? * Transaction Timeout detection. We frequently get support requests (via the forums or elsewhere) from users who are experiencing intermittent rollbacks of transactions due to timeout. It is not a simple matter for the user to figure out that this is what's happening. * Transaction Profiling. It may be relatively easy to detect transactions that are taking longer than desired to complete. However, diagnosing which party in the transaction is to blame is non-trivial. * Loops and Diamonds detection. In a distributed transaction it is possible to introduce a loop or a diamond without realizing. JTS may tolerate this, but distributed JTA and bridged WS-AT to JTA does not. Identifying this scenario is non-trivial and requires detailed internal knowledge of the TM. * Reasoning about the System Architecture. Producing an architectural diagram of a distributed transaction with many participants and servers is not an easy task.  Furthermore it can be error prone and could change based on the application inputs. The difficulty of this task is further compounded if multiple transaction types are involved (WS-AT, WS-BA, REST-AT, etc). This diagram is essential for reasoning about the current architecture and for considering improvements or changes. Also this diagram alone may not be enough without detailed profiling overlayed. * Analyzing Disk Syncs. One approach to improving the performance of a transaction is to reduce the number of disk syncs. The problem is that it is often difficult to calculate exactly how many you are performing and what delay each adds. h3. Who is the target audience? * End users, to diagnose their own issues * GSS, to diagnose customer issues * Architects, to analyze their system architecture * Those new to the field of transactions, learning what's going on. h3. How does it solve these problems? The tool analyses the server log and gathers data on every transaction ran. The tool could also support live updates for a server that is still running. The tool assumes that it can gather all its information from log statements. If it can't, we take the view that some logging is missing and then add it. We may also want the tool to support different log levels. For example, it may need a log level of TRACE to acquire full knowledge of the system. This may introduce too much of a performance overhead, so we may want to allow the tool to tollerate the reduced information provided by the less verbose log levels. In this case only basic information would be provided. h6. Querying feature The data can be queried to find out specific information. For example, show me all the transactions that rolled back. Given a rolledback transaction, the data should be available to diagnose exactly why it rolledback. Other things you may want to query by: * *Outcome*. Committed, Rolledback, heuristic, etc * *Type*. JTA, JTS, WS-AT, REST-AT, etc * *Duration*. Find all fast or slow transactions * *Inflight*. Show transactions currently inflight * *Stuck*. Inflight transactions that have been running for longer than Xms. * *Recovery*. All transactions that needed to be recovered. h6. Diagnostics The tool could also allow 'profiles' to be plugged in. A 'profile' is responsible for identifying common problems that we see users having. Hopefully these would allow issues to be identified earlier before they are passed further up the support chain. For example, we may create a 'profile' that searches over the data looking for loops or diamonds. Another could be responsible for identifying timeouts and maybe hinting at their cause. These 'profiles' would be created based on community demand. h6. Visualization In order to help architects reason about the system architecture, the tool could produce a visualization of a transaction of interest. A few diagrams should give you an idea of what the tooling could produce: https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-48255-2-20252/TXVisualCommitted%282%29.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-48255-2-20252/310-205/TXVisualCommitted%282%29.png Here we can see that a transaction was begun on Server1. It enlisted a DB and JMS queue locally and invoked a remote service on Server2. A second resource (DB2) was enlisted on Server2. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-48255-2-20253/TXVisualRollback.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-48255-2-20253/310-211/TXVisualRollback.png In this example we can see that the transaction rolled back because DB2 voted rollback. Other possible features: * *Participant types*. Display if the participant is one or two phase aware for JTA/JTS. Display the completion type (Participant/Coordinator) for WS-BA. * *    Resource types*. Whether it's a database or message queue and maybe include the name and version. * *Multiple Transaction Types*. Somehow depict the type of transaction (JTS, WS-AT, REST-AT, etc). * *Display Bridges*. Display when a transaction is bridged from one type to another * *In flight Transactions*. More useful for long running transactions; display the current status of each participant and update the display in real-time as the status changes. * *Recovery Status*. Show which resources crashed and the status of those resources already committed or recovered.</body>

Building Parent Pom &amp; Target Platforms Locally Or, "What if Maven can't find the upstream artifacts in Nexus?" Sometimes, Maven can't find the upstream artifacts - parent pom, tycho plugins, minimum (Juno SR0) or maximum (Juno SR1 or later) target platforms. Or maybe you want to build them locally in order to see how Tycho builds them, or contribute a fix. To work around resolution problems, just build locally: cd /tmp; git clone git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-maven-plugins.git cd /tmp; git clone git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build.git cd jbosstools-maven-plugins/tycho-plugins; mvn install; cd - cd jbosstools-build/parent;  mvn install; cd - cd jbosstools-build/target-platforms; mvn install -Pjbosstools-minimum,jbosstools-maximum h3. Maven &amp; Java Memory Configuration To configure the amount of memory used by Maven, you can define MVN_OPTS as follows, either in the mvn / mvn.bat script you use to run Maven, or set as global environment variables. Here's how to do so for  http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=262465 Fedora,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables Ubuntu,  http://forums.techarena.in/windows-xp-support/1152405.htm Windows,  http://www.digitaledgesw.com/node/31 OSX. set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m h2. Verify or Install? mvn verify will perform all build and test steps, but it won't install the bundles in your local repository. mvn install does install in you local repository. When an eclipse-plugin is installed in your repo, it is always used as default when resolving dependency. It is not possible to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, mvn verify is to be prefered to mvn install. However, if you want to build stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use mvn install. In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if your use-case requires it. +*What if I've already built something locally, but I want to build against the server version instead of my local repo?*+ There are  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform#Locally_built_artifacts two approaches that work here: a) override temporarily when building, using -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore b) delete ~/.m2/repository/.meta/p2-local-metadata.properties h2. About Target Platform and related profiles The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from this TP are allowed to be used in code. If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&amp;summary=Add%20[YOUR%20REQ]%20to%20Target%20Platform&amp;components=12310540&amp;issuetype=13&amp;Create=Create open a ticket to request it. Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's up to you to choose the one that match your needs: h3. Using published Target Platform definition (Recommended) unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target Platform repository. * Pros:* No additional thing to do than invoking Maven * Always up-to-date * Cons: Speed - (to evaluate) Consume it by adding *-Punified.target* to you Maven invocation command-line h3. Or, getting a local copy of the Target Platform * Pros: Speed +++ * Cons: Step to be repeated whenever  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build/tree/master/target-platforms target platforms change h4. Get it h5.  Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder on your disk. Just remember to update your  #settings.xml settings.xml file to point at the location where you unpacked it. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/e420-wtp340.target.zip e420-wtp340.target.zip (current minimum TP) http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/e421-wtp341.target.zip e421-wtp341.target.zip (current maximum TP) and then unzip it : unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/jbosstools-build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR0c/multiple/target/multiple.target.repo/   or unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/jbosstools-build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR1a/multiple/target/multiple.target.repo/ h5. OR, use Maven to build it See  #maven-nexus-resolution-problems Building Parent Pom &amp; Target Platforms Locally #maven-nexus-resolution-problems  # h4. Use it as a Maven mirror Once you get the target platform available locally, you can use it instead of the remote sites to save time. For this, we can simply use Tycho target-platform mirroring:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors As example, you can simply edit to your ~/.m2/settings.xml the definition of the repositories to mirror: (replace /home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/.... by a path where your local repository actuaaly stands) &lt;settings&gt;      &lt;mirrors&gt; &lt;!-- IMPORTANT: Sites in target platforms: must not have trailing slash! --&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/e420-wtp340.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/e421-wtp341.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/jbds600-e420-wtp340.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/jbds600-e421-wtp341.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;     &lt;/mirrors&gt; &lt;/settings&gt; h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platforms and want to test local changes. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP definitions from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build.

Build a component along with all its dependencies from sources ("bootstrap" build) This will build exactly what you have locally * Pros:* You are sure of the version of sources that is used for your JBT dependencies * You don't loose time in resolving your JBT deps * Cons:* You need sources for your dependencies too * You often build more stuff that what you really want to test cd ~/trunk/jbosstools-server mvn verify  -P unified.target -*Pbootstrap* h2. Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd jbosstools-build mvn clean install -gs ~/.m2/settings.xml | tee build.all.log.txt (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\jbosstools-build    or Remember to adjust your  #settings.xml settings.xml file to specify where you have your local target platform mirror built (or where you downloaded &amp; unpacked a target platform zip. Windows users, if you don't have a .m2 folder, see  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081617/missing-maven-m2-folder this article. h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13876/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13877/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: clean install -B -fae -e Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13878/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13879/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13880/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13881/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13882/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools-server/site/target/server.site-*.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools-server/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., jbosstools-server depends on jbosstools-base, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. Dealing with timeouts for tests (To be rewritten soon...)  http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during Juno-based builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

    <body>Very true, the prefill is left over from other configs -- useless in this test. I did try increasing the blocking-timeout (default 30), but it just waits longer to timeout. It seems stable and working with the increased number of connections.  I am curious about that one connection, but it's ok for now. Thanks for your help.</body>

    <body>Hello, we have a real strange behavoir, which can´t be profiled with JProfiler cause it looks like a blocking inside JBoss before passing by any requests to our app. We are using a .WAR with Seam 2, JSF 1.2 (JSF 2.0 excluded in AS7), Richfaces 3.3.3 and Hibernate and C3P0, so a classic combination. In the past we were using Tomcat with embedded JBoss as our Application server without any problems. Now we tried to switch to AS7 and we have the strange the behavoir that with about 30 users and 2sec. think time our webapp is getting really slow and we have minutes of response time but also after stopping our stress test jboss as7 is still really slow, also returning back static resources like images is quite slow but CPU / memory is fine. Same .war on Glassfish or Tomcat with embedded Jboss is running without any problems. Are the any known issues cause of JSF 1.2 downgrade? or any other suggestions? Thanks alot for any help and if you need further informations just ask. Thnx René</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: AS7 getting slower</header>
    <body>You have JSF bundled in your WAR?  If you want to do that then you need to use the WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL context param.  But that's not the best way to do this.  Take JSF jars out of your deployment. You are also trying to use the "1.2" slot for JSF by specifying it in jboss-deployment-structure.xml.  Don't do that. To use the built-in version of JSF 1.2, just put this in your web.xml:    &lt;context-param&gt;       &lt;param-name&gt;org.jboss.jbossfaces.JSF_CONFIG_NAME&lt;/param-name&gt;       &lt;param-value&gt;Mojarra-1.2&lt;/param-value&gt;     &lt;/context-param&gt; Stan</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JMX Development] - Making an apps log available to JMX-Console as notification</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm new to this technology and community, I've tried to read about this on the web, but couldn't find something that would work for me. I've an application which is using log4j logging which has a file appender. On deploying this into JBOSS, I wanted to be able to have JBOSS pick the logging information and be able to display them as Alerts or something. For JBOSS's own log4j setting, I uncommented the JMXNotification appender etc and also modified the service.xml to allow for alerttables but all I get there is JBOSS specific alerts. Nothing related to the application, it continues to log stuff to it's file though. Another thing that I wanted to be able to do was to be able to view the logs as notification in say jconsole but when I connect my jboss instance, I am able to access the MBEANS and the logging within it but the notification tab is disabled, it only allows me some operations like getting log level etc. My app EAR doesn't contain with it the app log4j and my JBOSS version is 5.1, JDK is 1.5 Thanks in advance for your time and help. Regards.</body>

    <body>Thanks Wolf-Dieter. I had resolved it lastnight. The method is copy the EJB interface class into the Web App's class path. and then the Web App can find the EJB class. And I also test the other method, I add the EJB remote interface (UsersDaoRemote.java) into the Web App's project, it work fine too! *I had confused about the Web Container and the EJB container, since the Web Container have more and more functions about EJB(likes WebBean). Does it have possible that the Web Container replace the EJB Container, or the two Container combine to one Container in the future?*</body>

    <body>Immediately after updating an application user's password in the database, JBoss throws javax.ejb.EJBAccessException: JBAS013323: Invalid User.  It appears that JBoss security attempts to reauthenticate the principal with every method invocation between web and ejb container, which fails because the principal's password has become stale.  I was surprised to see the UsernamePasswordLoginModule trying to login again, with the resulting "Password invalid/Password required" error.  I'm using 7.2.0.Alpha-1-SNAPSHOT.  Shouldn't this problem have been resolved ( https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-3498 AS7-3498)?</body>

    <body>I think the problem is that SessionManager#logout (which programmatically logs out the user e.g. HttpServletRequest#logout)) is invoked before invoking LoginHistoryService#create.  SessionManager is a CDI bean and LoginHistoryService is SLSB.  I think the "Invalid User" is a result of logout removing the principal prior to invoking create on the SLSB. I'm looking into it, but want to let you know now what I think the problem is before you waste time on this.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - Re: LoginModule defined with cached=true, but called between web and ejb container</header>
    <body>Okay I've put together a quickstart app, but I'm still confused about something.  If a method of a managed bean invokes HttpServletRequest#logout and HttpSession#invalidate and attempts to invoke a method on a secure EJB, this should be forbidden by JBoss security.  Is this true?  Because what I'm observing is that JBoss security only forbids such method invocation if the user's password has been changed in the underlying data source during the user's session.  As long as the user's password has not been changed the secure method can be invoked after the principal has been removed and after the session has been destroyed. Check out the attached application. 1.  Make a browser request against localhost/Foobar.  You will be redirected to index.xhtml. 2.  Login 3.  If login is successful, you will be served loggedIn.xhtml, a facelet that allows you to change the password or log out.  If you change the password loggedIn.xhtml is reloaded. 4.  Re-enter the password that you logged in with and click +Submit New Password+. 5.  Click +Logout Failure+, which programmatically logs you out and ends the session prior to looking up LoginHistoryService and invoking LoginHistoryService#create. 6.  Notice that no error occurred.  LoginHistoryService EJB, which is protected by @RolesAllowed("SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR"), was looked up and LoginHistoryService#create was invoked +after+ programmatic logout. 7.  Repeat steps 2 - 5 except on step 4 enter a different password.  Notice that in step 6 an error occurs, EJBAccessException: JBAS013323: Invalid User.  In the stack trace note the following: PBOX000206: Login failure: javax.security.auth.login.FailedLoginException: PBOX000070: Password invalid/Password required In both scenarios, above, the password was changed in the underlying database during the user's session.  Only difference being that in one case the password was identical to the login password and in the other case the password was changed to a different password.  In both cases HttpServletRequest#logout and HttpSession#invalidate were invoked +prior+ to invoking LoginHistoryService#create. 8.  Repeat steps 2 - 7 except on step 5 click +Logout Success+ instead of +Logout Failure+.  The only difference between +Logout Failure+ and +Logout Success+ is that LoginHistory#create is invoked prior to HttpServletRequest#logout and HttpSession#invalidate.  What step 8 demonstrates is that JBoss Security behaves as expected when LoginHistoryService#create is invoked prior to removing the principal and destroying the session. It seems that in the above scenarios JBoss Security should not attempt to authenticate the user after HttpServletRequest#logout is invoked.  Instead of attempting to authenticate it should be attempting to authorize, and if the principal has been removed the error should come back as follows: javax.ejb.EJBAccessException: JBAS014502: Invocation on method: public void com.foobar.service.LoginHistoryService.create(com.foobar.model.LoginHistory) of bean: LoginHistoryService is not allowed instead of the FailedLoginException. I will finish my wiki article and post it with the quickstart after this confusion is resolved.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - Re: LoginModule defined with cached=true, but called between web and ejb container</header>
    <body>I believe the problem here is that you need to programmatically login with the new credentials so that the underlying security context can be updated. When you login (step 2) a security context is established in the web layer. This context contains the authenticated principal/password and is propagated to the EJB container when calling EJBs. It is established once the call is served by a thread and is cleaned up after the thread returns. In your example, you are invalidating the session and calling the EJB as part of the same method, so this is what happens: 1- context is established using the principal/password associated with the session, lets say userA/passA. 2- session.invalidate() is called, causing the security cache to purge the entry that corresponds to userA. 3- you call the LoginHistoryService EJB. The WEB layer will use the established security context to propagate the identity/password to the EJB container. As there is no cache entry for userA, a new authentication will take place and the DBLoginModule will be called.   3a - if you changed the DB password to the same password (passA), then the authentication will succeed as the exisiting context will propagate the userA/passA pair and this will match the values found in the DB.   3b - if you changed the password to a different password, then the authentication will fail because the existing context will propagate the userA/passA pair and the DB will have a different value for the password. This is why you see no error in the first case and a login failure in the second. When you call loginSuccess, you successfully invoke the EJB because the security cache is still active and the security context that was established in the web layer still reflect the correct username and password pair that exists in the DB. So when the invocation reaches the EJB container, the security cache is hit and the user is authenticated. Note that there's no way to escape authentication in the EJB container as all EJB calls are required to be authenticated by the EJB specification. Finally, you invalidate the session and return, so the existing security context is removed and when the client (browser) attempts to call a protected resource he should be redirected to the login page as the session has been terminated. I believe you can get around the error in the first scenario by calling request.login(username, newPass) after invoking logout (and before invoking the EJB) so that the web container updates the existing security context. This would cause the new username/password pair to be propagated to the EJB container in subsequent calls and you should get no errors from the EJB security layer.</body>

Definitely.  But I don't think it will be a system property.  My plan is to add a management option to the JSF subsystem.  So you will be able to set this in XML and/or via CLI.</body>

I tryed to call my JBPM project as Jar file, it generated an error saying : " GRAVE: Exception lors de l'envoi de l'évènement contexte initialisé (context initialized) à l'instance de classe d'écoute (listener) com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving interface method "javax.servlet.jsp.JspApplicationContext.getExpressionFactory()Ljavax/el/ExpressionFactory;" the class loader (instance of org/apache/catalina/loader/WebappClassLoader) of the current class, com/sun/faces/config/ConfigureListener, and the class loader (instance of org/apache/catalina/loader/StandardClassLoader) for resolved class, javax/servlet/jsp/JspApplicationContext, have different Class objects for the type javax/el/ExpressionFactory used in the signature     at com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener.registerELResolverAndListenerWithJsp(ConfigureListener.java:1595)     at com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener.contextInitialized(ConfigureListener.java:419)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.listenerStart(StandardContext.java:3972)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.start(StandardContext.java:4467)     at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.start(ContainerBase.java:1045)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHost.start(StandardHost.java:785)     at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.start(ContainerBase.java:1045)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine.start(StandardEngine.java:443)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.start(StandardService.java:519)     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.start(StandardServer.java:710)     at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start(Catalina.java:581)     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)     at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)     at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.start(Bootstrap.java:289)     at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:414) org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext start " I thought to use web services, I'm not sure if it will help.

    <body>Hi there, Due tu a customer request, we have made a small patch to the 4.2.3 release in order to allow exceptions from the JDBC driver to be integrated as the cause of XA transaction abortions (in this case, a deferred constraint violation). I'm not sure if this release is still maintained somehow since I couldn't find a repository for it, but if it is feel free to have a look at the attached patch file and integrate it if needed.

Unfortunately JBTM 4.2.3 is in critical bug fix only mode so we won't be able to add this to that branch. Also in later revisions of the software we are now handling these exception types and logging them to disk. Hopefully as you upgrade, that will still fulfil your customers requirements. Tom</body>

    <body>Hi Antoan, I faced the same problem (e.g. 'Checksum failed'), and, in my case, I solve this error by changing the 'host' security-domain configuration. According to  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16876 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/DRAFTUsingJBossNegotiationOnAS7, the 'host' security-domain should be configured like that :     &lt;security-domain name="host" cache-type="default"&gt;         &lt;authentication&gt;         &lt;login-module code="Kerberos" flag="required"&gt;             &lt;module-option name="storeKey" value="true"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="useKeyTab" value="true"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="principal" value="host/testserver at MY_REALM"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="keyTab" value="/home/username/service.keytab"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="doNotPrompt" value="true"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="debug" value="false"/&gt;         &lt;/login-module&gt;         &lt;/authentication&gt;     &lt;/security-domain&gt; In my case, the solution was to configure it like that :     &lt;security-domain name="host" cache-type="default"&gt;         &lt;authentication&gt;         &lt;login-module code="Kerberos" flag="required"&gt;             &lt;module-option name="storeKey" value="true"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="useKeyTab" value="true"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="keyTab" value="/home/username/service.keytab"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="doNotPrompt" value="true"/&gt;             &lt;module-option name="debug" value="false"/&gt;         &lt;/login-module&gt;         &lt;/authentication&gt;     &lt;/security-domain&gt; Cheers</body>

    <body>@Tim H You can acheive the same results in a 'cleaner' way, with the PropertiesRolesMappingProvider. Just replace your 'RealmUsersRoles' login-module with : &lt;mapping&gt;     &lt;mapping-module code="PropertiesRoles" type="role"&gt;         &lt;module-option name="rolesProperties" value="/path/to/users-roles-mapping.properties" /&gt;     &lt;/mapping-module&gt; &lt;/mapping&gt; And the content of '/path/to/users-roles-mapping.properties' should be username at DOMAIN=Users username2 at DOMAIN=Users username3 at DOMAIN=Users An alternate solution is to use the 'SimpleRolesMappingProvider' mapping-module : &lt;mapping&gt;     &lt;mapping-module code="SimpleRoles" type="role"&gt;         &lt;module-option name="username at DOMAIN" value="Users" /&gt;         &lt;module-option name="username2 at DOMAIN" value="Users" /&gt;         &lt;module-option name="username3 at DOMAIN" value="Users" /&gt;     &lt;/mapping-module&gt; &lt;/mapping&gt; Cheers</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Experimenting with Single Installation Patching</header>
    <body>*+Initial draft; I haven't verified everything in this doc yet!!!+* Instructions for experimenting with the " https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47500 Single Installation Patching" feature currently being developed. These instructions assume basic git knowledge and knowledge of how to work with the AS 7 code base. See " https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15596 Hacking on JBoss AS7" for basic background. h2. Getting and Building the Source The patching feature is currently on a topic branch being maintained by Emanuel Muckenhuber. Until that branch is merged into master: 1) If you haven't already, clone the AS repo $ git clone git://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as.git 2) Add Emanuel's github repo as a remote $ cd jboss-as $ git remote add -f emanuel git://github.com/emuckenhuber/jboss-as.git 3) Checkout a new branch "patches-master" to track Emanuel's branch $ git checkout -t emanuel/patches-master 4) Build the AS $ ./build.sh add the -DskipTests option to skip running tests if you want the build to go a bit faster. h3. Generating Patches To generate a patch, you'll need 5 things: 1. An unzipped AS distribution representing the AS release being patched. This is the "applies-to-dist". This can be any AS7 release distribution, or the output of any successful build of the AS7 codebase since 7.1.0.Final was released. (Even earlier would probably work fine.) 2. An unzipped AS distribution representing the "patched" AS release. This is the "updated-dist". This is a distribution built from code that is newer than whatever went into the "applies-to" distribution. It can be a later release or build, or even the same distribution as the "applies-to-dist" that you've manually modified in some fashion. 3. An AS distribution you built following the instructions in the "Getting and Building the Source" section above. The patch generation tool is included in this distribution. If the distribution you are using for the "updated-dist" was built in that manner, then you can use it; you don't need a separate distribution. At some point we'll distribute the patch generation tool as a separate distribution, but for now it's simplest just to use an AS distribution. In the rest of this section, we'll refer to this as the "patch generation tool distribution." 4. A patch-config.xml file providing instructions about how to create the patch. See details below. 5. The filesystem location where you want the patch file to be written (including the name of the file.) To run the patch generation tool: $ cd /root/of/the/patch/generation/tool/distribution $ java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.patching.generator --help INFO  [org.jboss.modules] JBoss Modules version 1.1.3.GA Usage: patch-gen.sh [args...] where args include:     --applies-to-dist=&lt;file&gt;  Filesystem path of a pristine unzip of                               the distribution of the version of the                               software to which the generated patch                               applies     -h, --help                Display this message and exit     --output-file=&lt;file&gt;      Filesystem location to which the                               generated patch file should be written     --patch-config=&lt;file&gt;     Filesystem path of the patch generation                               configuration file to use     --updated-dist=&lt;file&gt;     Filesystem path of a pristine unzip of                               a distribution of software which                               contains the changes that should be                               incorporated in the patch     -v, --version             Print version and exit To actually run the patch generation tool and not just get help output, you will need to append the --applies-to-dist, --updated-dist, --patch-config and --output-file arguments described above to the process launch command (instead of --help), with the appropriate value for each included. The java command above is pretty lengthy, so we've written a shell script that does the same thing. In the source code it can be found at patching/src/main/resources/patch-gen.sh. Copy that to the bin/ dir of the patch generation tool distribution and then you can get the output above by simply doing: $ bin/patch-gen.sh --help +TODO: the patch-gen tool should use sensible defaults for --applies-to-dist, --updated-dist and --output-file such that only --patch-config needs to be specified. Or, allow those locations to be specified in the patch-config.xml file itself.+ * +Default for +--updated-dist+ can be the current working dir, or its parent if the current working dir is named bin/. Apply some simple sanity checks, e.g. check for jboss-modules.jar etc. The assumption here is the tool is being run from the ++--updated-dist++ (which is the newest dist and thus will have the newest version of the tool) + * +Default for +--applies-to-dist+ can be a sibling of the root of --applies-to-dist, named the same as the applies-to-version in the patch-config.xml. + * +Default for --output-file can be patch.par in the current working dir, assuming no such file already exists+ h4. Methods of Patch Generation There are two basic methods of patch generation. Which the tool should use is declared in the patch-config.xml file: * generate-by-diff: The patch generation tool itself compares the contents of the --applies-to-dist and the --updated-dist and creates a patch. This is most useful for CP patches. +TODO for one-off patches allow an option where the diffing algorithm ignore will timestamps as described by Jeff Mesnil (http://https://community.jboss.org/wiki/SingleInstallationPatching#comment-11114).+ * specified-content: The patch-config.xml file declares in detail what modules, bundles and misc files are to be added, updated or removed via the patch. This is most useful for one-off patches where the patch author knows what has changed. h4. The patch-config.xml File The patch-config.xml file provides basic metadata about the patch, along with instructions on how to generate it. The person preparing the patch creates the patch-config.xml file. +Note: the file doesn't have to be named patch-config.xml; it can be named anything.+ The simplest way to describe the file is to show a couple of examples. The full xsd for the file can be found in the AS source dist at patching/src/main/resources/patch-config.xsd. An example patch-config file for a generate-by-diff patch: &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt; &lt;patch-config xmlns="urn:jboss:patch-config:1.0"&gt;     &lt;name&gt;6.1.0-to-6.1.1&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;description&gt;Cumulative patch to move from EAP 6.1.0.GA to EAP 6.1.1.GA&lt;/description&gt;     &lt;cumulative applies-to-version="EAP 6.1.0.GA" resulting-version="EAP 6.1.1.GA"/&gt;     &lt;generate-by-diff/&gt; &lt;/patch-config&gt; An example patch-config file for a specified-content patch: &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt; &lt;patch-config xmlns="urn:jboss:patch-config:1.0"&gt;     &lt;name&gt;JBPAPP6-123&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;description&gt;One off patch to fix JBPAPP6-123&lt;/description&gt;     &lt;one-off&gt;         &lt;applies-to-version&gt;EAP 6.1.0.GA&lt;/applies-to-version&gt;     &lt;/one-off&gt;     &lt;specified-content&gt;         &lt;modules&gt;             &lt;added-module name="org.jboss.as.foo" /&gt;             &lt;updated-module name="org.jboss.as.bar" slot="eap"/&gt;             &lt;removed-module name="org.jboss.as.fubar" /&gt;         &lt;/modules&gt;         &lt;misc-files&gt;             &lt;updated-misc-content path="bin/standalone.sh" /&gt;             &lt;updated-misc-content path="bin/standalone.bat" /&gt;         &lt;/misc-files&gt;     &lt;/specified-content&gt; &lt;/patch-config&gt; h3. Applying Patches Only an AS release that includes the patching feature can be patched using the patching tool. So, that means you can only experiment with applying patches to an AS distribution you built following the instructions in the "Getting and Building the Source" section above. That limits things a bit as far as what patches you can try to apply; for example you couldn't generate a patch that represents the difference between 7.1.2.Final and 7.1.3.Final and then apply it to 7.1.2.Final. To apply a patch, you need: 1. A patch file, prepared as described in the "Generating Patches" section. 2. An unzipped AS distribution that represents the "applies-to" distribution. This can be the exact same "applies-to" distribution you used when creating the patch, or, if you want to experiment with how the patch tool deals with the (typical) situation where the user has in some way modified a standard AS version, you can make some sort of modification. We use the standard AS CLI tool to provide the user interface for the patch application tool. To see how to apply the patch, cd into the root of the installation being patched, launch the CLI and get the help for the "patch" command: $ bin/jboss-cli.sh -c [standalone at localhost:9999 /] patch --help SYNOPSIS     patch       &lt;action&gt; &lt;action_arguments&gt;*       [--override-all]       [--override-modules]       [--override=path(,path)*]       [--preserve=path(,path)*]       [--host=&lt;host&gt;]           where &lt;action&gt; can be   apply           - apply a patch   info            - information about the installed patches   rollback        - rollback a patch that has been applied           and &lt;action_arguments&gt; depends on the &lt;action&gt; ACTION: apply    Apply a patch    .... h3. This document won't include any more details on actually executing the patch command. Part of the goal of experimenting with it is to see if the --help output is adequate for users to understand what to do. The patch command only stages the patch (i.e. modifies the filesystem in a way that should not impact the running target process.) To actually have the patch take effect in the runtime, the target process needs to be restarted: [standalone at localhost:9999 /] :shutdown(restart=true) Note that simply reloading the target process (using the :reload operation) is insufficient. +TODO add options to the patch command to automatically restart the process if staging is successful.+ h3. The patch info The patch info shows all currently active patches. In case there is no cumulative patch active it will return "base". [standalone at localhost:9999 /] patch info     "outcome" : "success",         "cumulative" : "6.1.0-to-6.1.1",         "patches" : [ "JBPAPP6-123" ] h3. Conflict resolution Conflict dection is run for both applying and rolling back patches. In case conflicts are detected and the patch operation will fail and return all found conflicts as part of the failure-description. Since modules are not directly touched there is only a single swtich to ignore those (--override-modules). h3. Following Progress The patching feature is still under active development, so if you want update your build and see what's new: 1) cd into the git repo you cloned in step 1) of "Getting and Building the Source" above. 2) Pull down the latest $ git fetch emanuel 3) Make sure you have a clean repo $ git status 4) Rebase your branch onto the latest $ git checkout patches-master $ git rebase emanuel/patches-master 5) Build again</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: CLI deployment	archive problem</header>
    <body>The "solution" was to manually copy my jdbc driver to the deploy directory, and not have inside the .war-file. Then you can reference it in your deploy.scr (in your .war-file). If you run the depoy.scr directly from within the bin directory, the file "jtds-1.2.6.jar" must be in that directory.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: CLI deployment	archive problem</header>
    <body>Thanks for the quick reply! I think my issue might be more related to the archive being processed as a single operation than with the jdbc driver itself, which, apparently, does deploy ok (I'm using today's sources from GitHub). I opened a new issue for my specific problem, if you're interested  https://community.jboss.org/message/779399#779399 &gt;&gt; Anyway, isn't deploying the driver separetly against the whole spirit of a CLI deployment archive, that is to unify application configuration?

    <body>This document will collect the requirements for security for the various JBoss Community projects in one place. h2. h2. Projects Providing Requirements 1. JBoss Application Server 2. Aerogear 3. JBoss Developer Framework/JBossWay 4. RESTEasy 5. GateIN 6. DeltaSpike 7. ModeShape 8. Teiid h2. Requirements (In Progress) 1. Need simpler application security programming model. 2. Need better control over authentication mechanism. 3. Need security detached from the containers. 4. Need an Identity Management Model. (Represent Users/Roles/Groups/Attributes with databases/ldap). 5. Need Challenge/Response based authentication model. 6. Need fine grained authorization and permission model. 7. Need support for SAML2, OAuth2, JOSE. 8. Operations on the Identity Model automatically flush any authentication caches.

    <body>If you are using EAP, or a custom built version of AS7 upstream you should be able to get it to work by adding this into your jboss-deployment-structure.xml: &lt;jboss-deployment-structure xmlns="urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.2"&gt;   &lt;deployment&gt;      &lt;exclude-subsystems&gt;         &lt;subsystem name="resteasy" /&gt;     &lt;/exclude-subsystems&gt;     &lt;/deployment&gt; &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt; Unfortunatly this was added after 7.1.1, however it basically means that the container will not add resteasy into your deployment, or attempt to do any jax-rs integration.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Experimenting with Single Installation Patching</header>
    <body>Instructions for experimenting with the " https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47500 Single Installation Patching" feature currently being developed. These instructions assume basic git knowledge and knowledge of how to work with the AS 7 code base. See " https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15596 Hacking on JBoss AS7" for basic background. h2. Getting and Building the Source The patching feature is currently on a topic branch being maintained by Emanuel Muckenhuber. Until that branch is merged into master: 1) If you haven't already, clone the AS repo $ git clone git://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as.git 2) Add Emanuel's github repo as a remote $ cd jboss-as $ git remote add -f emanuel git://github.com/emuckenhuber/jboss-as.git 3) Checkout a new branch "patches-master" to track Emanuel's branch $ git checkout -t emanuel/patches-master 4) Build the AS $ ./build.sh add the -DskipTests option to skip running tests if you want the build to go a bit faster. h3. Generating Patches To generate a patch, you'll need 5 things: 1. An unzipped AS distribution representing the AS release being patched. This is the "applies-to-dist". This can be any AS7 release distribution, or the output of any successful build of the AS7 codebase since 7.1.0.Final was released. (Even earlier would probably work fine.) 2. An unzipped AS distribution representing the "patched" AS release. This is the "updated-dist". This is a distribution built from code that is newer than whatever went into the "applies-to" distribution. It can be a later release or build, or even the same distribution as the "applies-to-dist" that you've manually modified in some fashion. 3. An AS distribution you built following the instructions in the "Getting and Building the Source" section above. The patch generation tool is included in this distribution. If the distribution you are using for the "updated-dist" was built in that manner, then you can use it; you don't need a separate distribution. At some point we'll distribute the patch generation tool as a separate distribution, but for now it's simplest just to use an AS distribution. In the rest of this section, we'll refer to this as the "patch generation tool distribution." 4. A patch-config.xml file providing instructions about how to create the patch. See details below. 5. The filesystem location where you want the patch file to be written (including the name of the file.) To run the patch generation tool: $ cd /root/of/the/patch/generation/tool/distribution $ java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.patching.generator --help INFO  [org.jboss.modules] JBoss Modules version 1.1.3.GA Usage: patch-gen.sh [args...] where args include:     --applies-to-dist=&lt;file&gt;  Filesystem path of a pristine unzip of                               the distribution of the version of the                               software to which the generated patch                               applies     -h, --help                Display this message and exit     --output-file=&lt;file&gt;      Filesystem location to which the                               generated patch file should be written     --patch-config=&lt;file&gt;     Filesystem path of the patch generation                               configuration file to use     --updated-dist=&lt;file&gt;     Filesystem path of a pristine unzip of                               a distribution of software which                               contains the changes that should be                               incorporated in the patch     -v, --version             Print version and exit To actually run the patch generation tool and not just get help output, you will need to append the --applies-to-dist, --updated-dist, --patch-config and --output-file arguments described above to the process launch command (instead of --help), with the appropriate value for each included. The patch-gen tool will attempt to use default values for --applies-to-dist, --updated-dist and --output-file, so only --patch-config absolutely needs to be specified. * Default for --updated-dist is the current working dir, or its parent if the current working dir is named bin/. The assumption here is the patch generation tool is itself being run from the --updated-dist (which is the newest dist and thus will have the newest version of the tool). The tool does a couple basic sanity checks to verify that the working dir is actually an AS distribution. If those sanity checks don't pass, the patch generation will fail with a message indicating --updated-dist needs to be specified. * Default for --applies-to-dist can be a sibling of the root of --applies-to-dist, named the same as the applies-to-version in the patch-config.xml. * Default for --output-file can be &lt;name-of-patch-as-specified-in-patch-config&gt;.par in the current working dir. The java command above is pretty lengthy, so we've written a shell script that does the same thing. In the source code it can be found at patching/src/main/resources/patch-gen.sh. Copy that to the bin/ dir of the patch generation tool distribution and then you can get the output above by simply doing: $ bin/patch-gen.sh --help h4. Methods of Patch Generation There are two basic methods of patch generation. Which the tool should use is declared in the patch-config.xml file: * generate-by-diff: The patch generation tool itself compares the contents of the --applies-to-dist and the --updated-dist and creates a patch. This is most useful for CP patches. +TODO for one-off patches allow an option where the diffing algorithm ignore will timestamps as described by Jeff Mesnil (http://https://community.jboss.org/wiki/SingleInstallationPatching#comment-11114).+ * specified-content: The patch-config.xml file declares in detail what modules, bundles and misc files are to be added, updated or removed via the patch. This is most useful for one-off patches where the patch author knows what has changed. h4. The patch-config.xml File The patch-config.xml file provides basic metadata about the patch, along with instructions on how to generate it. The person preparing the patch creates the patch-config.xml file. +Note: the file doesn't have to be named patch-config.xml; it can be named anything.+ The simplest way to describe the file is to show a couple of examples. The full xsd for the file can be found in the AS source dist at patching/src/main/resources/patch-config.xsd. An example patch-config file for a generate-by-diff patch: &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt; &lt;patch-config xmlns="urn:jboss:patch-config:1.0"&gt;     &lt;name&gt;6.1.0-to-6.1.1&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;description&gt;Cumulative patch to move from EAP 6.1.0.GA to EAP 6.1.1.GA&lt;/description&gt;     &lt;cumulative applies-to-version="EAP 6.1.0.GA" resulting-version="EAP 6.1.1.GA"/&gt;     &lt;generate-by-diff/&gt; &lt;/patch-config&gt; An example patch-config file for a specified-content patch: &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt; &lt;patch-config xmlns="urn:jboss:patch-config:1.0"&gt;     &lt;name&gt;JBPAPP6-123&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;description&gt;One off patch to fix JBPAPP6-123&lt;/description&gt;     &lt;one-off&gt;         &lt;applies-to-version&gt;EAP 6.1.0.GA&lt;/applies-to-version&gt;     &lt;/one-off&gt;     &lt;specified-content&gt;         &lt;modules&gt;             &lt;added-module name="org.jboss.as.foo" /&gt;             &lt;updated-module name="org.jboss.as.bar" slot="eap"/&gt;             &lt;removed-module name="org.jboss.as.fubar" /&gt;         &lt;/modules&gt;         &lt;misc-files&gt;             &lt;updated-misc-content path="bin/standalone.sh" /&gt;             &lt;updated-misc-content path="bin/standalone.bat" /&gt;         &lt;/misc-files&gt;     &lt;/specified-content&gt; &lt;/patch-config&gt; h3. Applying Patches Only an AS release that includes the patching feature can be patched using the patching tool. So, that means you can only experiment with applying patches to an AS distribution you built following the instructions in the "Getting and Building the Source" section above. That limits things a bit as far as what patches you can try to apply; for example you couldn't generate a patch that represents the difference between 7.1.2.Final and 7.1.3.Final and then apply it to 7.1.2.Final. To apply a patch, you need: 1. A patch file, prepared as described in the "Generating Patches" section. 2. An unzipped AS distribution that represents the "applies-to" distribution. This can be the exact same "applies-to" distribution you used when creating the patch, or, if you want to experiment with how the patch tool deals with the (typical) situation where the user has in some way modified a standard AS version, you can make some sort of modification. We use the standard AS CLI tool to provide the user interface for the patch application tool. To see how to apply the patch, cd into the root of the installation being patched, launch the CLI and get the help for the "patch" command: $ bin/jboss-cli.sh -c [standalone at localhost:9999 /] patch --help SYNOPSIS     patch       &lt;action&gt; &lt;action_arguments&gt;*       [--override-all]       [--override-modules]       [--override=path(,path)*]       [--preserve=path(,path)*]       [--host=&lt;host&gt;]           where &lt;action&gt; can be   apply           - apply a patch   info            - information about the installed patches   rollback        - rollback a patch that has been applied           and &lt;action_arguments&gt; depends on the &lt;action&gt; ACTION: apply    Apply a patch    .... h3. This document won't include any more details on actually executing the patch command. Part of the goal of experimenting with it is to see if the --help output is adequate for users to understand what to do. The patch command only stages the patch (i.e. modifies the filesystem in a way that should not impact the running target process.) To actually have the patch take effect in the runtime, the target process needs to be restarted: [standalone at localhost:9999 /] :shutdown(restart=true) Note that simply reloading the target process (using the :reload operation) is insufficient. +TODO add options to the patch command to automatically restart the process if staging is successful.+ h3. The patch info The patch info shows all currently active patches. In case there is no cumulative patch active it will return "base". [standalone at localhost:9999 /] patch info     "outcome" : "success",         "cumulative" : "6.1.0-to-6.1.1",         "patches" : [ "JBPAPP6-123" ] h3. Conflict resolution Conflict dection is run for both applying and rolling back patches. In case conflicts are detected and the patch operation will fail and return all found conflicts as part of the failure-description. Since modules are not directly touched there is only a single swtich to ignore those (--override-modules). h3. Following Progress The patching feature is still under active development, so if you want update your build and see what's new: 1) cd into the git repo you cloned in step 1) of "Getting and Building the Source" above. 2) Pull down the latest $ git fetch emanuel 3) Make sure you have a clean repo $ git status 4) Rebase your branch onto the latest $ git checkout patches-master $ git rebase emanuel/patches-master 5) Build again</body>

    <body>When I replied to this before, I fear I came off more negative about it than I intended. I don't think it's the right thing to do when generating a cumulative patch. I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do with no way to turn it off when generating a one-off patch. But I can certainly imagine people preparing those would find it very useful to have a configurable option to do a generate-by-diff patch instead of a specified-content patch without having these kinds of date issues leading to irrelevant stuff ending up in the patch.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Web Development] - Authenticate credentials with LDAP for specific requests (after logging in)</header>
    <body>I have a web application that I deploy using JBoss 5.2. In order for a user to use the application, he/she must authenticate with an LDAP server (using simple authentication) with a username and password. This is all done through setting up the login-config.xml for JBoss and providing a &lt;login-module&gt; with our implementation. The problem comes in here: After having logged in, I have a scenario that requires the user to provide a username &amp; password when a particular action is performed (which I will also authenticate with the LDAP server). I want to be able to reuse the same mechanism that I use for authenticating the user into the web application. My form to log in to the application posts to j_security_check so in accordance with this, I was trying to send a request to j_security_check but JBOSS returns a 404. From reading around a bit, I've gathered j_security_check cannot be accessed by any arbitrary request and must be in response to a challenged request to a secured resource. So then, how can I authenticate the second set of credentials the user has provided with the same LDAP server?</body>

  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Design of AS7	multi-JSF feature</header>
    <body>The default is still the default.  So for now, the default impl is the one in the "main" slots in the com.sun.jsf-impl and javax.faces.api modules.  If the developer uses the JSF_CONFIG_NAME context param, then you will use the jars in the slot specified.  We have this problem already.   In AS7.0.x forward, you can use the value of "Mojarra-1.2" to refer to the "1.2" slot that ships with AS7.  I'm just reusing that context param to let you specify more slots.  So the short answer for now is, you have to look at web.xml. The next step in multi-JSF will be to add two attributes to the JSF subsystem.  The first is a read-only attribute that lists all of the installed JSF implementations.  The second is a read/write attribute that allows you to change the default JSF implementation.  So I can imagine a tool that reads the list and presents the user with a choice of implementations.  Then it fills in the context param appropriately.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Design of AS7	multi-JSF feature</header>
    <body>I don't see any fundamental issues with this from a patching point of view. The described process does not modify any existing modules or misc files in the distribution; it simply adds new modules. Users are free to do this, and application of a subsequent patch will not blindly disable those modules. A subsequent patch could have one of 3 effects with respect to those modules: 1) The patch doesn't include any modules with the same name and slot as one of these, nor does it include other modules with the same packages/classes. No problem. The x.y.z.mojarra-2.2.0-m05 modules will still be loadable. 2) The patch includes a newly added module with the same name and slot as one of these modules. This is extremely unlikely, given the slot names you are using. But if it did happen, the patch tool will regard the presence of the user-added module as a patch conflict and the user will have to include a param to the patch operation stating that the patch should be applied even though the patch will override a user-modified (in this case, added) module. See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47500 Single Installation Patching for more on patch conflict detection and resolution. 3) The patch installs a new module with a different name/slot that contains jars with the same packages/classes. Now there will be two modules available that provide the same packages/classes. Which module gets used in a particular situation depends on the context. If the jsf integration somehow set up a situation where both javax.faces.api.mojarra-2.2.0-m05 and a javax.faces.api.main that contained different versions of the same classes were visible, that would probably be an issue (I haven't thought about it deeply) but that issue has nothing to do with patching. And I assume your impl was designed to deal with that.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>I previously sent this via email, but now that yesterday's jboss.org issues are cleared up, I'll repeat it for others to see: Makes sense. Once the patch is applied, any change made by an earlier one-off patch needs to be removed. That's what I mean by "invalidating." What I'm talking about in the paragraph above is related to the "Patch Conflict Detection" algorithm discussed on the main article, in particular the "Misc files" part. The goal is to detect *end user modifications* to the misc files and require the user to declare that overriding that modification with the patch is OK. Say we have a 6.1.1 CP patch with an applies-to version of 6.1.0. The patch.xml includes a mod to standalone.sh with an existing-hash of "123", the hash of the file present in 6.1.0. But the user has already applied a one-off that changed the file to one with hash "234". Quite possibly the same hash as the new file in 6.1.1, but not necessarily. The patch application tool should understand that given the status of the installation "234" is now the expected "existing-hash" for the file and should recognize there is no conflict requiring user input. To do that it will need to know that one-off patch XYZ changed the file to one with hash "234". Yes, that's correct. I have doubts about relying on dates for ordering. They are useful for providing information to users about when they did things, but I think we'd be better off specifically maintaining an order.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - AS7 Password	Vault on Windows</header>
    <body>I'm running with both Java and JBossAS7 installed in directories that include spaces. This causes problems in the definition of JAVA_HOME and in the classpath used in the vault.bat file. Given: JAVA_HOME set to C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_07 JBoss installed to C:\My Application Name\jboss-as-7.1.1.Final This is the error message I got when running the vault.bat file:      \Java\jdk1.7.0_07\bin\java was unexpected at this time. I fixed it by editing the \bin\vault.bat batch file as follows: -- Add quotes around %JAVA_HOME% in the code that sets the JAVA environment variable (line 17):           set JAVA="%JAVA_HOME%"\bin\java -- Add quotes around %JBOSS_VAULT_CLASSPATH% in the line that invokes the VaultTool (line 52):           %JAVA% -classpath "%JBOSS_VAULT_CLASSPATH%" org.jboss.as.security.vault.VaultTool</body>

    <body>Yes, the JSF subsystem impl deals with that.  At most, one JSF api and one JSF impl module can be loaded per WAR deployment.  So class conflicts can not occur. Thanks for the feedback.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Working directory for server processes not configurable</header>
    <body>Hi, Currently there seems no configuration option to set the working directory of the server-process(es). Host- and domain-controller both use system-property "user.dir", but for the server-process in org.jboss.as.host.controller.ManagedServer.ProcessAddTask#execute() the following is used to initiate the new process: where environment.getHomeDir().getAbsolutePath() donates the working directory for the new process. I JBoss with changed working directory and this seems not to introduce any issue, so I would request this becomming a configuration option. Do you agree/disagree and should I open a JIRA for it? Also see this discussion of one of my colleagues for general thoughts regarding the working directory:  https://community.jboss.org/thread/203368 https://community.jboss.org/thread/203368.

    <body>FYI: I wrote some similar functionality for RHQ's bundle upgrade capability. Based on that experience, I would recommend to whomever is implementing this new AS7 patch feature to review  RPM's upgrade rules to see how RPM does things - this is very helpful to see the different types of conflicts you can expect and how to resolve them: http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/ch-rpm-upgrade.html#S2-RPM-UPGRADE-CONFIG-FILE-MAGIC http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/ch-rpm-upgrade.html#S2-RPM-UPGRADE-CONFIG-FILE-MAGIC RHQ's upgrade rules ended up being very similar: https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/RHQ/Ant+Bundles#AntBundles-UpgradeRules https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/RHQ/Ant+Bundles#AntBundles-UpgradeRules Hopefully, those wikis can be helpful.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>Note that this patching mechanism should be disabled or otherwise not be allowed to be performed if the AS7 was installed via rpm since I assume "bad things" could happen if this is attempted. I assume this patch feature will not work on an rpm installation based on a recent comment I read, "RPM is a separate SCM solution and is not covered by the patching mechanism." We will want to prevent someone installing AS7  via RPM and some admin later on coming in thinking "oh look, here's a patch to upgrade, I'll just apply it using this new patch feature."</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Extending AS 7</header>
    <body>Like all releases of JBoss Application Server, AS 7 provides a relatively small core set of functionality, along with APIs that can be used to extend this core functionality in order to provide the services external clients need. As in previous releases, the AS ships with extensions to its core functionality that provide capabilities like Java EE support. And, as in previous releases, it is possible for custom extensions to the AS to be integrated, either by organizations (e.g. other open source projects or ISVs) who want to distribute a modified version of the AS to others, or by organizations who directly run the AS. The means by which AS &amp; can be extended is significantly different than it was in previous releases. This article is intended to discuss those differences, and to elicit thoughts on best practices. The article is focused on educating organizations who want to distribute a modified version of the AS, but hopefully the information herein will be useful to organizations who directly run the AS. h2. How Extending AS 7 is Different from Previous Versions The fundamental difference between AS 7 and previous versions is that in AS 7 +everything isn't a deployment+. In AS 6 and early, the core AS provided some basic functionality including a couple of basic services called +deployers+. Deployers could recognize the existence of content on the filesystem, a.k.a. "deployments", process that content and install new services into AS's core service container. Most of the services provided by the AS itself were themselves +deployments+.  The web container, the EJB container, the transaction manager, the naming service, etc, all were installed as +deployments.+ Even additional deployers, beyond the basic ones that were part of the core AS, were themselves deployments. Those additional deployers could do things like parsing a web.xml, making it possible to deploy additional kinds of deployments (e.g. a war file), but they themselves were deployments. And, of course, end user applications like Java EE ears and war, were also deployments. So, in this architecture, end user applications were logically equivalent to the web container, the EJB container -- all extended the core capabilities of the AS and all were +deployments.+ In AS 7, the basic design philosophy is that deployments are end user applications. Adding new fundamental capabilities to the application server is done by installing +extensions+. However, since deployments and extensions in the end add new capabilities to the core server, what are the differences between the two? Why would someone wishing to extend the AS choose one or the other? h2. Extensions and Subsystems An +extension+ is an implementation of the org.jboss.as.controller.Extension interface, packaged in a directory structure accessible to the JBoss Modules modular classloading layer used by the AS. An extension can register one or more +subsystems+ with the core AS. A subsystem is a set of functionality; e.g. the web container is a subsystem. See the  https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Extending+JBoss+AS+7 Extending JBoss AS 7 documentation for more details on how to write an extension. Extensions are packaged as JBoss Modules modules. Typically you would place your extension's module(s) in the $JBOSS_HOME/modules directory. (You can place your modules in another location if before running standalone.sh or domain.sh you set the $JBOSS_MODULE_PATH environment variable to a value that includes both your location and the location of the $JBOSS_HOME/modules directory.) Why would you use an extension to add functionality to the AS? * You want to make aspects of your new functionality manageable by your end users, e.g. via the AS's CLI tool and via the standalone.xml and domain.xml configuration files. The Extension interface is the means by which the core AS is told about the management API exposed by your new functionality, and about the xml parsing and marshalling logic used to read and write its configuration. One of the main new features in AS 7 is a consistent management solution; if you want your functionality to properly integrate with these management features you need to use an extension. * You want to be able to process deployments. AS 7 has "deployment unit processors" which are conceptually similar to "deployers" in early releases. They are invoked during deployment and undeployment of deployments and can perform processing work on the deployment. Only extensions can register deployment unit processors with the core AS. * Patching. We will introduce a patching tool in later releases of AS 7. Extensions will have significant advantages over deployments when it comes to patching. See the section on this below. * You wish to differentiate your extension from end user applications. End users will typically use deployments to extend the AS's functionality (e.g. deploying a WAR deployment adds new functionality). Using deployments instead of extensions for things other than end-user applications mixes end user stuff with non-end-user stuff, somewhat muddying the waters. In particular:* The actual physical binaries may be mixed. If instead of using an extension you put a deployment in standalone/deployments, now your binaries will be mixed with end user binaries. To avoid this, you either need to configure a separate deployment scanner to deploy your content from a different location, or require some sort of installation process (e.g. execution of a CLI script) to get your deployment installed. The "configure a separate deployment scanner" approach is only available for standalone servers, since deployment scanners are not supported in a managed domain. * Your deployments will be mixed with the end user deployments in the management resource tree. For example if an admin starts the CLI and executes ls deployment they will see your deployments in the same list as their own. Same thing with the admin console. h2. Deployments A deployment in AS7 is binary content that is installed into the server via a mangement client (or a deployment scanner, which is really just an automated management client.) The management client either uploads the content to the server or informs it of its filesystem location, and then asks the server to install that content. The server does so by taking the deployment's bits and making them available to the various deployment unit processors (DUPs) that have been added by the server's extensions. The DUPs examine the contents of the deployments and take the necessary actions to start the necessary services for the deployment and integrate them with the needed container services. Why would you use a deployment to add functionality to the AS? * You're an end user installing an EE application. * You're an end user adding new mbean services or JBoss MSC services and you are not concerned with making your new functionality manageable via the AS's CLI tool or via the standalone.xml and domain.xml configuration files. You could use an extension for your new functionality instead of a deployment, but many users will find using a deployment easier, particularly if they are porting something from a previous AS release. * You're not an end user, but your new functionality requires complex integration with the AS's EE containers. The deployment unit processors that handle deployments take care of that integration for you. h2. A Mixed Approach It is possible to mix extensions and deployments. For example, if you wanted to expose aspects of your new functionality's configuration to admins via the AS's management APIs, but also need to accept end user requests via the servlet container, you could package a war inside your extension's module and then have the "add" operation handler for your subsystem deploy the war. See  https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/commit/197f7b64b48f4a28a7d44be4820d0941179d7dba https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/commit/197f7b64b48f4a28a7d44be4820d0941179d7dba for a prototype extension with a subsystem that deploys an ear when it is added to the server. This approach still suffers from the drawback that your extension's war will appear alongside end-user applications in the management resource tree. Note that most of the content of that prototype extension commit is boilerplate.  The key technical bits that do the deployment/undeployment are in two classes: *  https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/commit/197f7b64b48f4a28a7d44be4820d0941179d7dba#diff-10 The subsystem add operation handler *  https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/commit/197f7b64b48f4a28a7d44be4820d0941179d7dba#diff-11 The subsystem remove operation handler The rest of the commit relates to creating an extension module as well as making that module part of the standard JBoss AS build. The latter part is not relevant to extensions whose source code isn't part of the AS source tree. h2. Implications for Patching In a future AS 7 release we will be introducing a patching feature, with a tool that stage a patch in an AS 7 installation and then (optionally) restart the standalone server of Host Controller + servers running on that installation. The feature will include the ability to roll back patches. This feature has implications for the decision about whether to add functionality to the AS via extensions or deployments. Extensions are packaged as JBoss Modules modules, typically located in the $JBOSS_HOME/modules directory. It will be quite simple for the patching tool support staging/installation/rollback of modules. When the AS launches, it is provided with a "modules path", a list of filesystem locations under which modules can be found. This "modules path" is conceptually very similar to an OS $PATH environment variable. It's an ordered list of locations; when the AS needs to locate a module for the first time it iterates through that list of locations checking each for the desired module; once found the search stops. This behavior makes it simple to apply staging/install/rollback behavior to modules by storing the patch's modules in a new directory location specific to the patch and then manipulating the "modules path" used by the AS. The upshot of all this is functionality added to the AS via an extension will be easily patchable. The patching tool will also be able to patch arbitrary non-module files located in the AS installation (e.g. the bin/standalone.sh script). It will do this by storing a copy of the original file in a private working area, and then replacing the file with the patched one. Rollback of the patch means restoring the original file by copying it back from the private working area. This works fine, +unless the server is actively using the original file+. If the server is actively using the original file, the patch cannot be +staged+. As soon as the patch tool lays down the new file, it will be visible to the running server. An example of the kind of problem this can cause is if your added functionality was packaged as a deployment located in standalone/deployments. If you create a patch file with a new version of your deployment and ask your users to use the patching tool to install it, the tool will put a new version of the file in standalone/deployments -- and the deployment scanner will see that new version and tell the patching tool to deploy it.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single Installation	Patching</header>
    <body>This article outlines design notes for the single instance patching feature being developed for AS 7.2. The 7.2 version of the feature will be  to apply a patch to a single installation of the AS (i.e. a single unzip of the AS distribution.) That single installation may be  used for a standalone server or for a managed domain Host Controller and servers. However, the 7.2 version will not support coordinated patching by the patching tool of multiple installation in a managed domain. The user can of course independently patch multiple installations in a domain, coordinating the application of those patches themselves. The basic patching process will consist of: 1. The user obtains a patch file. 2. The user uses the CLI tool to connect to a standalone server or Host Controller that is running on the installation that is to be patched.1. The server or Host Controller may be running in admin-only mode or running normally. However, some patches may not be able to be applied if the target process isn't running in admin-only mode 3. The user invokes a command on the CLI providing the location of the patch file. The CLI invokes an operation(s) on the target process telling it to stage the patch. 4. The target process stages the patch by applying the patch contents to the filesystem.1. The changes made to the filesystem during staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before applying the patch. 5. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the staged patch is visible in the runtime. Patches can also be rolled back: 1. The CLI tool can be used to instruct the target process to revert a patch. 2. Patch reversion results in changes to the filesystem that are staged in the same manner as what is done with a patch installation.1. The changes made to the filesystem during patch rollback staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch rollback with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before rolling back the patch. 3. The CLI tool is used to restart the target process. Upon restart the rolled back patch is no longer visible in the runtime. h1. Patch File A patch file is a zip archive that contains a patch.xml file that is used to describe the patch along with the updated modules, OSGi bundles and miscellaneous files that comprise the patch. It's structure is as follows: + patch.xml + modules ++ patch modules in the same structure as they appear the modules dir in the normal AS dist + bundles ++ patch bundles in the same structure as they appear the bundles dir in the normal AS dist + misc ++ misc files that need to be updated, organized in a directory structure that matches the directory structure of the AS dist h3. The patch.xml File The patch.xml file describes the patch. It includes basic information about the patch along with metadata about the modules, bundles and misc files in the patch. h5. Basic patch metadata * The name of the patch * The type of the patch (one-off vs cumulative, etc -- TODO list all) * The version to which the patch applies * A text description of the patch * TODO others h5. Module metadata * The name of the module * The slot of the module * The hash of the module.xml file of the previous version of the module. Not present if the relevant module did not exist in the version being patched. h5. Removed module metadata Identifies modules that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed module * The slot of the removed module h5. Bundle metadata * TODO anything? h5. Removed bundle metadata Identifies bundles that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed bundle h5. Misc file metadata * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file did not exist in the version being patched, or if the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h5. Removed misc file metadata Identifies misc files that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h2. Patch Staging The target process when it applies a patch will create a patches directory directly underneath the root of the AS distribution. As with other directories, the location of this directory can be controlled via a system property passed to the JVM at process launch. Before patch staging begins, a check is made as to whether the target process is in admin-only mode. If it is not, and an unresolvable conflict is detected between a module, bundle or miscellaneous file contained in the patch and a user-modification of the corresponding item in the installation being patched, the patch staging process will be aborted with an error message.  See "Patch Conflict Detection" below. h4. Modules Patch modules will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. Information about the location of this directory will be stored in a location visible to the module loader used by JBoss Modules at boot.  This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the module loader currently in use by the target process. For modules that the patch "removes", the patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory will include that module, but with a special module.xml file and no other contents. The module.xml file will include the tag &lt;missing/&gt;. The JBoss Modules release used with this will interpret that &lt;missing/&gt; tag and if seen will throw a ModuleNotFoundException (which is what it would throw if it were unable to locate a module.  The nice thing about this approach is if a later patch adds back the removed module, that patch will take precedence in the module path, and the "missing" module.xml will be irrelevant. h4. Bundles Patch bundes will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the OSGi subsystem currently in use by the target process. Information about removed bundles will also be stored in a location visible to the OSGi subsystem at next boot. TODO see if an approach similar to the &lt;missing/&gt; approach can be used. h4. Misc files Misc files are staged by copying them directly to their normal location on the filesystem. A copy of the existing file at that location will be stored in the patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. TODO describe check for user-modified misc files. h4. Configuration files Patches will not modify the configuration files of the target process. Configuration patching will not be supported in this version of the feature (and may never be supported.)  Configuration files belong to the user. However, a copy of all existing configuration files will be made in a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. During patch rollback, these configuration files will be restored. This backup is necessary because once the patch is applied to the runtime, any management operation that results in persistence of the configuration will use the xml schemas associated with the patched version of the core AS and any subsystems. If the patch is reverted, those schemas may not be intelligible to the version of the code to which the runtime has been reverted. h2. Patch Application A patch is "applied" by stopping the target process and then restarting it in a normal manner; e.g. from the command line or by using the :shutdown(restart=true) command from the CLI. The patch contents that have been staged are then used by the restarted process. h4. Modules In 7.2 the AS will use a custom implementation of the JBoss Modules ModuleLoader interface, instead of the default implementation used in previous AS 7 releases. The selection of this custom implementation will be part of the launch VM command created by the startup scripts (i.e. standalone.sh/standalone.bat/domain.sh/domain.bat). The module loader works using a notion of a "module path", which is an ordered list of directories in which modules are located. When the module loader needs to find a module, it searches the directories in that path in order, and once it finds the desired module the search ends. Thus, directories earlier in the path listing take precedence over those found later. This is all very similar to how an OS uses the $PATH environment variable. Previous AS7 releases allowed the user to specify a $JBOSS_MODULES_PATH environment variable to declare the "module path", with a default value of $JBOSS_HOME/modules used if not specified. The startup scripts used to the AS pass that module path into JBoss Modules (via the -mp &lt;the_path&gt; argument to java.)  In AS 7.2, the custom module loader we will use will support this behavior, but in addition the custom module loader we provide will be able to examine the patching metadata that will be persisted in the "staging" phase and from that will determine which of the patch-specific subdirectories of the patches directory need to be prepended to the module path. In addition, for modules that have been removed in patches, the custom module loader will know to not load those modules, even though the modules will still remain on the filesystem. h4. Bundles TODO -- basic idea is to do something similar to how modules work, but the details need to be sorted out. h4. Misc Files Application of miscellaneous files to the runtime is straightforward. The staging step places the patch's miscellaneous files in the normal location that the runtime services will expect, so when the target process is restarted, the runtime services see them. h2. Rollback Staging To do a patch rollback, the target process must be placed in admin-only mode. TODO h4. Modules TODO h4. Bundles TODO h4. Misc Files The backup copies of the miscellaneous files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored to their normal locations. Any misc files that were added as part of the "Patch Staging" process (i.e. those that were new in the patch) will be removed. h4. Configuration The backup copies of the configuration files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored. *+Any configuration changes made while the patch was in place will be lost.+* h2. Rollback Application A patch rollback is "applied" by stopping the target process and then restarting it in a normal manner; e.g. from the command line or by using the :shutdown(restart=true) command from the CLI. The modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that have been staged are then used by the restarted process. Issue: the client tool (i.e. CLI) may need to be able to roll back a patch itself, not relying on the target process to do it. This is because a failed patch may leave the target process in a state such that it is unable to respond to commands from the CLI. This capability will not work remotely -- the CLI process will need to be running on the same machine as the installation being patched, and running under a user account with the necessary filesystem permissions to update the filesystem. h4. Modules See the discussion in "Patch Application" above of how the module path works. When a patch is rolled back, the metadata the custom module loader uses to construct the module path will no longer indicate the patch's modules should be on the path, so they will not be available for loading. h4. Bundles TODO -- basic idea is to do something similar to how modules work, but the details need to be sorted out. h4. Misc Files As was the case in the discussion in "Patch Application" above, the patch rollback staging step places the correct miscellaneous files in the normal location that the runtime services will expect, so when the target process is restarted, the runtime services see them. h2. Patch Conflict Detection At the beginning of the patch staging process, a check will be made for conflicts between the patch and any user modifications to the same item. The user when executing the patch command can provide information to guide the tool in resolving conflicts. Any conflicts that cannot be resolved will result in the patch staging being aborted with no changes to the filesystem. Conflict types are: * Modules. If the patch is updating or removing an existing module, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing module's contents. The patching process will hash the current module's contents to check for modifications. If any affected module is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some modules and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to a module, they will need to make an equivalent change to the patch module. The sole purpose of this "module conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Bundles: If the patch is updating or removing an existing bundle, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing bundle's contents. The patching process will hash the current bundle's contents to check for modifications. If any affected bundle is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified bundles is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some bundles and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to a bundle, they will need to make an equivalent change to the patch bundle. The sole purpose of this "bundle conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Misc files: If the patch is updating an existing misc file, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing file. If the patch is removing an existing directory, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing directory's contents. The patching process will hash the current file or directory to check for modifications. If any affected file/directory is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a permission indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. If no permission is available for a particular file or directory, the conflict will be treated as unresolved. These permissions can come in four forms:* A global permission to update all conflicting misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tool's patching command * A global permission to not update any conflicting misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tool's patching command * A file containing* a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is granted. * a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is denied, meaning the existing file should be retained. The patching feature will also include a command that can apply this conflict detection process and provide a report of conflicts. Users can use this command to check for conflicts in advance. TODO describe how this will work for patch rollback. h2. Patch Generation Tool * Accepts basic metadata along with the location of a distribution of the new version along with a distribution of the old version* Also includes details on any misc files that are expected to be in active use * Generates a patch.xml file * Can generate a full patch file * Optional: Can be run from inside the bin/ dir of the full distribution of the new version and if provided with the patch.xml file can generate a patch file from the contents of the full dist* Idea here is the patch.xml file could be distributed as part of the new version and the user could use it to generate patch h4.

Patching Deployments There has been some confusion related to how the patching tool can be used to patch a deployment that comes as part of some set of functionality that gets added onto the base AS (e.g. by a layered product that builds on top of EAP 6.) This section will attempt to address some of that confusion. See the  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 Extending AS7 wiki page for basic information on different approaches to adding more functionality to the AS. First, this patching tool is irrelevant when it comes to end user application deployments. Once the patching feature is available, end users should install an updated version of their application using the same mechanisms they've used for updating their application deployments in previous AS releases (CLI, deployment scanner, admin-console, JON.) The patching tool is not intended to replace or supplement these mechanisms. Second, the patching tool +will be capable of patching deployment archives provided by some add-on that uses the underlying AS+. However, there is an important consideration that needs to be understood. *It must be possible to stage a patch by copying the patch contents onto the filesystem without having that updated content become immediately visible to a running server that is reading that filesystem*. The staged content should sit there having no affect on the running server until the user chooses to restart the server. If a deployment archive is installed into the server by placing it in the deployments/ folder (or any other folder periodically scanned by a deployment scanner), this requirement cannot be reliably met. The scanner will notice the new deployment as soon as it is staged and will deploy it. Similarly, if the deployment archive is exploded, even if it is not installed by a deployment scanner, if the server is using the original exploded directory as the source of the live deployment, the "staging requirement" cannot be met. When the patch tool updates a file in the exploded archive, it will immediately be visible to the runtime services (e.g. to the running deployment's classloader.) How can AS add-ons install services while still supporting stageable patches?  There are 4 approaches, two based on using modules, two that don't use modules Using modules: 1.  Create an AS Extension implementation. Package it in a module. Have the Extension implement install your runtime services. This is the preferred approach wherever practical. 2. Create an AS Extension implementation. Package it in a module. Include the deployment archive inside the module. Have the Extension implementation programatically deploy it when the subsystem starts. See "A Mixed Approach" on the  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 Extending AS7 wiki page for an example extension that does this. Both of these approaches have no problems with patch staging, because when a module is patched, the patch is not visible to the running server's module loader until the server is restarted. If the deployment archive is not packaged inside a module, then it is a "Misc File" in terms of the previous discussion on this document. Therefore the rules for staging an update to a misc file described above apply. Given this, there are two mechanisms for making such a deployment "patchable": 1. Place the deployment in some location on the filesystem, but not in a directory scanned by a deployment-scanner.  Create an AS Extension implementation. Package it in a module. Have the Extension implementation, when the subsystem is added, copy the deployment content into an internal location (i.e. the data/ dir) and then invoke management operations to deploy the content from that location. The portal team was investigating installing their ear (which must be exploded and end user-modifiable) in this manner. The original deployment can be patched because it's the copy of the deployment that is being used by the running server. 2. Accept that the deployment archive cannot be truly staged. Include in the patch.xml file metadata indicating that the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server. When the patching tool goes to stage the patch, if it sees this metadata, it will check if the process is in admin-only mode. If it is not, it will refuse to install the patch until the process is placed in admin-only mode. This last mechanism of not truly supporting patch staging is only intended to serve as a fallback scenario for cases where no alternative is available for patching a particular file. It was not intended to serve as a mechanism for patching deployments installed by layered products, for which the other three alternatives are available.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Working directory for server processes not configurable</header>
    <body>No, the 'env' variable does not hold these values, but those are contained in the 'command'. This is an example: C:\jboss\runtime\jvm64\bin\java, -D[Server:server-one], (some more JAVA OPTS) -D[Host Controller]=true, -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000, -Dorg.jboss.resolver.warning=true, -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000, -Djboss.host.default.config=host.xml, -Djboss.modules.system.pkgs=org.jboss.byteman, -Djboss.home.dir=C:\jboss, -Djboss.domain.default.config=domain.xml, -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true, -Djboss.server.log.dir=C:\jboss\domain\servers\server-one\log, -Djboss.server.temp.dir=C:\jboss\domain\servers\server-one\tmp, -Djboss.server.data.dir=C:\jboss\domain\servers\server-one\data, -Dorg.jboss.boot.log.file=C:\jboss\domain\servers\server-one\log\boot.log, -Dlogging.configuration=file:C:\jboss\domain/configuration/logging.properties, -jar, C:\jboss\jboss-modules.jar, -mp, C:\jboss\modules, -jaxpmodule, javax.xml.jaxp-provider, org.jboss.as.server Anyhow, none of these is used as working directory, so doesn't help here.

    <body>Mmmh, might depend on Spring initialisation, maybe more logging help also you should check warnings. As you use EAP6 you should open a support case for this.</body>

I was wondering whether do we have any options to replace the code in server directly rather restarting the server everytime we do any change in the code. We had that option in OC4J, but i dont know how to do that in JBOSS 6. can someone help me in this? Thanks, Anand</body>

    <body>Hi everyone, i'm new to JBoss AS 7 and am trying to figure out how to use the  embedded  hibernate libraries inside my project.Actually, i want to use Eclipse and i'm wondering if there's a way to make my IDE able to "see" those jars without manually adding them as external jars. Any clue? Thanks in advance.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Questions from a	JBoss newbie</header>
    <body>This might not be very special to JBoss. If you use only Eclipse without any additional you have to add the libraries. You may use maven (and the Eclipse plugins) and you can set the dependencies whitin the pom.xml files. Examples for that you will find in the  http://www.jboss.org/developer/quickstarts.html quickstarts. You should have a look into ' http://www.jboss.org/developer The JBoss Way' for helpfull stuff as well.</body>

    <body>Thanks for the advice. I managed to have a first framework of the project running without Maven, but as i can understand is far better working with a layer that cares about dependencies, so i'll give it a try.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Periodic and size Based rotating File handler</header>
    <body>I know that jboss 7.1.1 comes with log handlers that roll over the logs based on Period (periodic-rotating-file-handler) and size (size-rotating-file-handler). What i want is a handler that rolls based on both. So for example within a single day I want the log files to roll over based on size and as soon as the day ends i want the log file to roll over as well. I see that jboss comes with logManager module version 1.2.2. However I also noticed that version 1.3.1 of the log Manager comes with exactly the appender I am looking for *PeriodicSizeRotatingFileHandler.* So I upgraded this module in jboss and configured a custom handler that rolled over daily and also based on size. However I noticed that the log statements dont seem to get logged correctly. The latest several log statements are never logged in the file although I see them in the console. it is not unitl something else is logged that i see the statements missing from earlier logged. Although the new latest logs are then missing.            &lt;custom-handler name="FILE" class="org.jboss.logmanager.handlers.PeriodicSizeRotatingFileHandler" module="org.jboss.logmanager"&gt;                 &lt;formatter&gt;                 &lt;/formatter&gt;                 &lt;properties&gt;                     &lt;property name="file" value="../standalone/log/archon-omni-dv/server.log"/&gt;                     &lt;property name="rotateSize" value="50000"/&gt;                     &lt;property name="maxBackupIndex" value="50"/&gt;                     &lt;property name="append " value="true"/&gt;                     &lt;property name="suffix" value=".yyyy-MM-dd"/&gt;                     &lt;property name="autoflush" value="true"/&gt;                 &lt;/properties&gt;             &lt;/custom-handler&gt; Anyone know of a way to accurately roll over based on both size and time on Jboss 7.1.1?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums]  [JBoss AS 7 Development] - AS7-4857 correct JPA dependency injection (stop injecting javassist a…  …nd let Hibernate include envers)</header>
    <body>A question regarding the changes by  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4857 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4857. After this, I have to include org.javassist into the dependencies of my ear. Otherwise I get lots of CNFE of org.javassist.*. I don't understand the background. Hibernate / JPA seems to need javassist. I did not mention it anywhere in my project. Why was it removed from the automatically added dependencies then. Or this there an option to avoid the use of javassist? If yes, what are the pros and cons?</body>

    <body>Hi, if you application needs javaassit then just include it yourself. as for JPA and javaassit goes, it is bit more complex than just that. jpa has dependancy to hibernate and hibernate has dependancy to javassist. and given that your application uses jpa, there is no need to directly include all transient depenencies. if you application still needs javaassit but you do not explecitly use it anywhere it might be interesting case to looke more into detail. Can you provide structure of your application (jar tf &lt;name of ear&gt;) and stacktrace you get. that will help find the couse of the issue. -- tomaz</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: JBossAS 7.1.3.CR1: JBoss Solder doesn't work anymore</header>
    <body>This is apparently caused by the changes made in  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-992 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-992 Methods added through AfterBeanDiscovery.addObserverMethod() previously didn't fire an event, but now they do. And the event actually has the annotatedMethod set to null (see line 45 at  https://github.com/weld/core/blob/master/impl/src/main/java/org/jboss/weld/bootstrap/events/ProcessObserverMethodImpl.java#L45 https://github.com/weld/core/blob/master/impl/src/main/java/org/jboss/weld/bootstrap/events/ProcessObserverMethodImpl.java#L45 ) Basically, Solder needs to handle the null, since it looks like there's no way to get the AnnotatedMethod from the ObserverMethod passed to addObserverMethod (at least for now... need to see what CDI1.1 says about this).</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Access EAR classpath from MBean in JBoss Module?</header>
    <body>I've defined an MBean whose classes are in a JBoss module (stored at $JBOSS_HOME/modules/ucs/jb4compat/main).  My configuration/standalone.xml lists this module as in global-modules under the ee subsystem. I have an EAR deployment (standalone/deployments/MyEar.ear) which has META-INF/jboss-service.xml that references the MBean in the module.  My EAR starts to deploy, the module class is found, and the start() method of the MBean is called.  All of the attributes listed in the mbean element in jboss-service.xml are called, and my properties are set as expected.  So far so good... The problem arises in that one of the attributes set via jboss-service.xml::server/mbean/attribute is intended to be the name of an attribute on the classpath.  Under JBoss 4.2.3 (from which I'm migrating), the MBean calls Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource([attributeValue]) which yields a URL to the classpath resource which would usually get something out of EAR/META-INF.  Under JBoss 7.1.1, the TCCL appears to be the JBoss Module (ucs.jb4compat) classloader rather than the EAR's classloader, so I have no access to classpath elements within the ear. Is there a way within the MBean's start() method that I can get a handle on the classloader of the EAR which contains the jboss-service.xml that spawned the MBean in the first place?  Any help would be appreciated. Best regards, Zac Bedell</body>

    <body>There is nothing in the Java EE specs that says that the root content of an EAR file should be accessible to deployed applications. The fact that it works for you in JBoss 4.x is an implementation accident and I would not expect it to work on any other vendor implementation either. You need to move your META-INF/jboss-service.xml file into a jar contained in the EAR/lib directory.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Access EAR classpath from MBean in JBoss Module?</header>
    <body>The location of the jboss-service.xml doesn't appear to make a difference.  Step-debugging through the MBean's start() method, it looks like the TCCL is set in such a way that I don't have a chance of getting at my deployment's resources.  Specifically:   // ...   // ... Inspecting loader at this point gives:   ModuleClassLoader for Module "ucs.jb4compat:main" from local module loader @23e8f4e1 (roots: /opt/software/sag/sag_dev/modules) IE the TCCL is the module's ClassLoader, not that of the EAR deployment.  To the best of my knowledge, I don't have any EAR classes available at that point from which I could grab an appropriate ClassLoader. Looking up the stack a bit, I see: // org.jboss.as.service.AbstractService: Which appears to stash the TCCL at that point and explicictly set it to the MBean's ClassLoader.  The stashed TCCL (old) at that point is "ModuleClassLoader for Module "org.jboss.as.sar:main" from local module loader @23e8f4e1 (roots: /opt/software/sag/sag_dev/modules)". I've tried repackaging my resource (login-config.xml) inside the ear as ear//lib/config.sar//META-INF/login-config.xml as well as ear//lib/config.sar//login-config.xml, but none of the ClassLoader's I have available within the MBean's start() method are anything related to my EAR or its contents. On a side note, I realize root-of EAR isn't expected to be in Classpath per EE spec, but I thought that contents of EAR/META-INF should be.  So in this case EAR/META-INF/login-config.xml would be equally accessible as EAR/lib/config.jar//META-INF/login-config.xml, assuming I had a ClassLoader with a view of the EAR.  Is that incorrect?  Granted the distinction is moot unless I can find an appropriate ClassLoader to pull from. Just by way of structure, here's what I'm working with at the moment: The EAR: /Work/ExactlyWatt/java/dist/server/deployments $ unzip -l ExactlyWatt.ear Archive:  ExactlyWatt.ear   Length     Date   Time    Name --------    ----   ----    ----         0  09-25-12 09:33   META-INF/       106  09-25-12 09:33   META-INF/MANIFEST.MF         0  09-25-12 09:33   lib/ 11378038  09-25-12 09:33   ExactlyWatt.war     55168  09-25-12 09:33   ExactlyWatt_ejb.jar ...       866  09-25-12 09:33   lib/config.jar (See below) ...     40161  09-25-12 09:33   lib/ydoclet-runtime.jar       568  09-25-12 09:32   META-INF/application.xml      1137  09-21-12 15:12   META-INF/exactlywatt-ds.xml      1050  09-24-12 15:26   META-INF/jboss-service.xml config.jar within EAR/lib: /Work/ExactlyWatt/java/dist/server/deployments/ear $ unzip -l lib/config.jar Archive:  lib/config.jar    Length     Date   Time    Name   --------    ----   ----    ----          0  09-25-12 09:33   META-INF/        106  09-25-12 09:33   META-INF/MANIFEST.MF        936  06-23-11 13:22   META-INF/login-config.xml   --------                   -------       1042                   3 files EAR/META-INF/jboss-service.xml: /Work/ExactlyWatt/java/dist/server/deployments/ear $ cat META-INF/jboss-service.xml &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;server xmlns="urn:jboss:service:7.0"   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"   xsi:schemaLocation="urn:jboss:service:7.0 http://ucmsload.courtnet.org/dtds/jb7/jboss-service_7_0.xsd"&gt; *  &lt;!-- Note this MBean deploys &amp; works properly.  It's accessing files on-disk in standalone/configuration rather than trying to pull from classloader.  --&gt;*   &lt;mbean code="ucs.jb4compat.SystemPropertiesService" name="jboss.util:type=Service,name=SystemProperties-ExactlyWatt"&gt;     &lt;attribute name="URLList"&gt;configuration/exactlywatt.properties&lt;/attribute&gt;   &lt;/mbean&gt;   &lt;mbean code="ucs.jb4compat.DynamicLoginConfig" name="sample-app:service=DynamicLoginConfig,domain=ExactlyWatt"&gt; *    &lt;!-- With or without "META-INF/" here makes no difference. --&gt;*     &lt;attribute name="AuthConfig"&gt;*META-INF/*login-config.xml&lt;/attribute&gt;     &lt;depends&gt;jboss.util:type=Service,name=SystemProperties-ExactlyWatt&lt;/depends&gt;   &lt;/mbean&gt; &lt;/server&gt; /Work/ExactlyWatt/java/dist/server/deployments/ear $ cat META-INF/application.xml &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;application xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"   xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://ucmsload.courtnet.org/dtds/javaee/application_6.xsd"   version="6"&gt;   &lt;description&gt;ExactlyWatt Jar Index&lt;/description&gt;   &lt;display-name&gt;ExactlyWatt&lt;/display-name&gt;   &lt;module&gt;&lt;ejb&gt;ExactlyWatt_ejb.jar&lt;/ejb&gt;&lt;/module&gt;   &lt;module&gt;       &lt;web&gt;          &lt;web-uri&gt;ExactlyWatt.war&lt;/web-uri&gt;          &lt;context-root&gt;/ExactlyWatt&lt;/context-root&gt;        &lt;/web&gt;   &lt;/module&gt; &lt;/application&gt; Note this particular attempt has jboss-service.xml directly in EAR//META-INF without a SAR file to wrap it.  If I change things to put jboss-service.xml inside EAR//config.sar//META-INF and add EAR//META-INF/jboss-app.xml with a &lt;module&gt;&lt;service&gt;config.sar&lt;/service&gt;&lt;/module&gt; and application.xml with &lt;module&gt;&lt;java&gt;config.sar&lt;/java&gt;&lt;/module&gt;, it makes no difference on any of this.  I still get the module's ClassLoader for TCCL in the MBean's start() method and have no access to the EAR deployment's contents.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Research for making a process instance go on with jbpm5 after server restarting.</header>
    <body>Hi all, I 'm doing some researches for going on the process with JBPM5.3 instances in the eviroment of persistence and I create two sample: https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-761013-19551/2.jpg  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-761013-19551/450-72/2.jpg 1. In the process , i defined a global variableA for printing it in the script1 and script2 , and the User Task1 can update it. I start the process and the instance will wait for completing of user task, every thing will be stored in the db. Now i stop the server and restart it , reload the session from db ,register the workItemHandler ,and get UserTask1 to complete whole process .In the userTask1 , i can get the global variable , because  it has been stored in the table of Content, and also script2 can print that variableA which is updated by user task1. It looks like everything is ok. Let us look another sample: https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/2-761013-19553/1.jpg  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-761013-19553/450-141/1.jpg 2. In this sample , when i complete the task 1 , i restart the server, then i reload the session , register the workItemHandler , but when i complete the task2 , the process instance will not go to the next node of script3.So i guess that the converge gateway don't know the task 1 has been completed before the server restart. Is that correct?What should i do for this issue?</body>

    <body>I guess that the node  just only exists in the memory ,it  will not be restored to db . so when i restart server , i will loss the status of node in the process instance.</body>

Can some one provide a solution or point me to an article or the documentation that might clarify this for me?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Jboss7 dependencies pratique : how to manage the version part of the a lib like {artifactId}-{version}.jar?</header>
    <body>Hi everyone, In Jboss7, we need to point out explicit dependencies,  in META-INFO/MANIFEST.MF or in jboss-deployment-structure.xml. Another thing very annoying, I have some EJB jars having the version in their name, like *ejb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar*. Therefore, to search the ejb from JNDI, i have to call search the name as : "java:global/*ejb-1.0-SNAPSHOT*/someDAOImpl!com.xxx.dao.web.local.someDAOLocal". That means after each release, hte JNDI name changes !  :(   :(   :( Does any body have some pratcical advices or experience pls ? That would be very nice. Many thx in advance.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single Installation	Patching</header>
    <body>This article outlines design notes for the single instance patching feature being developed for AS 7.2. The 7.2 version of the feature will be apply to apply a patch to a single installation of the AS (i.e. a single unzip of the AS distribution.) That single installation may be being used for a standalone server or for a managed domain Host Controller and servers. However, the 7.2 version will not support coordinated patching by the patching tool of multiple installation in a managed domain. The user can of course independently patch multiple installation in a domain, coordinating the application of those patches themselves. The basic patching process will consist of: 1. The user obtains a patch file. 2. The user uses the CLI tool to connect to a standalone server or Host Controller that is running on the installation that is to be patched.1. The server or Host Controller may be running in admin-only mode or running normally. However, some patches may not be able to be applied if the target process isn't running in admin-only mode 3. The user invokes a command on the CLI providing the location of the patch file. The CLi invokes an operation(s) on the target process telling it to stage the patch. 4. The target process stages the patch by applying the patch contents to the filesystem.1. The changes made to the filesystem during staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before applying the patch. 5. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the staged patch is visible in the runtime. Patches can also be rolled back: 1. The user can use the CLI tool to instruct the target process to revert a patch. 2. Patch reversion results in changes to the filesystem that are staged in the same manner as what is done with a patch installation.1. The changes made to the filesystem during patch rollback staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch rollback with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before rolling back the patch. 3. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the rolled back patch is no longer visible in the runtime. h1. Patch File A patch file is a zip archive that contains a patch.xml file that is used to describe the patch along with the updated modules, OSGi bundles and miscellaneous files that comprise the patch. It's structure is as follows: + META-INF ++ patch.xml + modules ++ patch modules in the same structure as they appear the modules dir in the normal AS dist + bundles ++ patch bundles in the same structure as they appear the bundles dir in the normal AS dist + misc ++ misc files that need to be updated, organized in a directory structure that matches the directory structure of the AS dist h3. The patch.xml File The patch.xml file describes the patch. It includes basic information about the patch along with metadata about the modules, bundles and misc files in the patch. h5. Basic patch metadata * The name of the patch * The type of the patch (one-off vs cumulative, etc -- TODO list all) * The version to which the patch applies * A text description of the patch * TODO others h5. Module metadata * The name of the module * The slot of the module * The hash of the module.xml file of the previous version of the module. Not present if the relevant module did not exist in the version being patched. h5. Removed module metadata Identifies modules that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed module * The slot of the removed module h5. Bundle metadata * TODO anything? h5. Removed bundle metadata Identifies bundles that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed bundle h5. Misc file metadata * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file did not exist in the version being patched. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h5. Removed misc file metadata Identifies misc files that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h2. Patch Staging The target process when it applies a patch will create a patches directory directly underneath the root of the AS distribution.

    <body>Hi, During some stress-testing our application, i get this exception, when we create multiple EJBClientContext Objects in different threads simultaniously (only in some of those threads): java.lang.IllegalStateException : EJBCLIENT000024: No EJB receiver available for handling [appName:jas-application, moduleName:core-ejb, distinctName:] combination     at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientContext.requireEJBReceiver(EJBClientContext.java:522)     at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClient.createSession(EJBClient.java:161)     at org.jboss.ejb.client.naming.ejb.EjbNamingContext.doCreateProxy(EjbNamingContext.java:135)     at org.jboss.ejb.client.naming.ejb.EjbNamingContext.createEjbProxy(EjbNamingContext.java:113)     ... 9 more In our case this exception occurs in at least 1 Thread when connecting and looking up a stateful bean with more than 10 Threads at the same time. Some debugging around this has shown that this exception is thrown because of a hard-coded timeout value in the class org.jboss.ejb.client.remoting.RemotingConnectionEJBReceiver.associate(). The code line has a TODO: |      | boolean successfulHandshake = false; | |          | // wait for the handshake to complete | |          | *// TODO: Think about externalizing this timeout* | |          | *successfulHandshake = versionHandshakeLatch.await(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);* | |              | final Channel compatibleChannel = versionReceiver.getCompatibleChannel(); | |              | final ChannelAssociation channelAssociation = new ChannelAssociation(this, context, compatibleChannel, this.clientProtocolVersion, this.marshallerFactory, this.reconnectHandler); | |                  | this.channelAssociations.put(context, channelAssociation); | |              | Logs.REMOTING.successfulVersionHandshake(context, compatibleChannel); | |              | // no version handshake done. close the context | |              | Logs.REMOTING.versionHandshakeNotCompleted(context); | |              | context.close(); | |          | context.close(); | When stressing the remote ejb client enough the client EJBClientContext is closed silently (because version handshake was not done within 5 seconds) and so no ejb receivers are available. I think, to make the timeout configurable would be a perfect solution for us. Should I create an Issue in JIRA? With best regards, Michael</body>

    <body>Hi, sorry, but I have no simple example for this issue. We create multiple ejb connections (each in a different thread, using the ThreadLocalContextSelector). When doing this simultaniously (say 20 connections or more) the server doesnt complete the handshake for some of the threads within this hard-coded timeout and the connection is closed. When delaying each connection for a short amount of time (~100ms), everything works fine. So it would be nice, when the timeout value is configurable.</body>

    <body>Hi there, I'd like to setup multiple *initial* connections (EJB receivers) for a remote standalone client to a *clustered* server. I expected to achieve this easily with the following configuration in jboss-ejb-client.properties: remote.connectionprovider.create.options.org.xnio.Options.SSL_ENABLED=false remote.connections=default,other remote.connection.default.host=192.168.0.1 remote.connection.default.port=4447 remote.connection.default.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS=false remote.connection.other.host=192.168.0.2 remote.connection.other.port=4447 remote.connection.other.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS=false This works fine for a non-clustered multiple-server setup but not if the servers are clustered like this: ./standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=Server1 -b=192.168.0.1 -bmanagement=192.168.0.1 ./standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=Server2 -b=192.168.0.2 -bmanagement=192.168.0.2 The application hangs while attempting to lookup an EJB.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - how to shutdown 1 of 2 standalone JB7 instances ?aa</header>
    <body>I have 2 standalone instances one is the +*admin-server*+ deployed with a *.war, the other is the *+operations-server+* deployed with a *.ear.   The +*admin-server*+ webapp provides a page for shutting down and starting the +*operations-server.  *+ I'm also allowing the user to reset which port the admin-server runs on and I do this through the CLI API to change the port and then issue a re-start to the +*admin-server. *+   My current problem is that when the +*admin-server*+ shutsdown, it takes down with it the currently running +*operations-server.*+ I have tried various ways of shutting down the +*admin-server :*+ 1. calling an external script that executes command line CLI shutdown command (+ie "jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=localhost:adminCliPort --command=:shutdown")++* *+ 2. issuing a CLI command via API, similarly to how the operations server is started and how port changes are made+ + 3. stopping the servicer that automatically restarts the +*admin-server*+ (I use /Library/LaunchDaemons/ file to create a service and on shutdown i issue a stop option for this service). NOTE: The shutdown of the +*admin-server*+ is not a problem, I can get it to shutdown immediately and restarts fine.   Also the +*operations-server*+ shutsdown fairly well on its own (ie. when the "shutdown" button on the webapp is pressed).  So just to clarify, the problem is that I can't shutdown only the +*admin-server*+ , it always brings down both servers eventhough i'm using a CLI command pointing to the +*admin-server*+. The 2 servers are running next to each other, meaning I made a copy of the jboss7/ distribution and named it admin-server/ therefore each server has its own bin/ and standalone/.   Is this a known issue where the server that starts the 2nd server will always take down the 2nd server ? Any help will be very much appreciated, I've been trying to get these 2 playing nice for a few days now. Thank you -Fabio</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: how to shutdown 1 of 2 standalone JB7 instances ?aa</header>
    <body>As there is no dependency between the servers (if you use standalone mode) I suppose that your web application will force the shutdown if you stop the admin server. What if you undeploy the *war? Are you able to log and see the shutdown request in your app?</body>

    <body>Thank you Wolf-Dieter!!!  ... that pointed me in the right direction for sure!! I tried the following series of steps and it worked for me: 1. server A , starts server B by executing : "./standalone.sh -Djboss.node.name=serverB" 2. a socket-binding port is changed on Server A via CLI and we are told it requires a reload. 3. undeploy the *.war from server A by executing the CLI command for "undeploy serverA.war" 4. execute a ":reload" command (this tends to take a little longer than a shutdown and restart in my environment, but its not that much of a concern). 5. go back to serverB and it remains running with the same process ID, so no interruptions!  (perfect!) Thanks again Wolf!!  I was thinking there was no way of doing this, but CLI in JBoss AS7 is very powerful indeed. I hope this helps others as well. -Fabio</body>

    <body>It sounds like the connection is timing out. Could you post the stacktrace when you run it on EAP 5.x. What happens if you extend the transaction timeout period (it defaults to 300 seconds). You can change the default via jbossts-properties.xml</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Need multiple connections for remote standalone client to clustered server</header>
    <body>Hi Ondřej, I agree with your analysis. However, the description you gave in Jira seems quite complicated and unneccessarily so. Perhaps I should add that I can reproduce the problem on a single host (localhost) with the following configuration in jboss-ejb-client.properties: remote.connectionprovider.create.options.org.xnio.Options.SSL_ENABLED=false remote.connections=default,other remote.connection.default.host=localhost remote.connection.default.port=4447 remote.connection.default.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS=false remote.connection.other.host=localhost remote.connection.other.port=4547 remote.connection.other.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS=false Starting my two server nodes like this: ./standalone.sh -c=standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=Server1 ./standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=Server2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100 Everything works fine *most of the time* but *sometimes* *the client gets stuck not* on the initial lookup (as erroneously described above) *but on the first EJB method invocation*. Even in my initial setup with the two servers bound to their own respective virtual network interface, *sometimes* the behaviour is alright but at other times the client just hangs and must be killed from the outside. I've composed a small Swing app with which the behaviour can be easily examined: https://github.com/lkuettner/jbosscc-as7-examples/tree/master/cluster-client-example https://github.com/lkuettner/jbosscc-as7-examples/tree/master/cluster-client-example Just build everything, start two AS 7 instances like described above (the second with a port offset of 100) and deploy cluster-example-server.jar on each of them. Now run the client and press the "invoke" button. If you see an SLSB node name, start the client over again - until it gets stuck eventually. Maybe some JBoss developer can have a look into this - Jaikiran?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Install JBOSS tools on Eclipse Juno (4.x)</header>
    <body>Greetings: I recently adopted Eclipse Juno for my IDE and went to the marketplace to install the JBOSS tools.  I noticed that there is only a package for Indigo and not one for Juno as of yet. I am on Mac OS X (Mountain Lion 10.8) and got the AS7 server running and starting at login.  This box is not a production box, but my development box.  I would probably deploy to a Linux box (specifically CentOS or Scientific) in production.  This is all background information. The question is how to get the JBoss Tools setup in Eclipse Juno?  I tried to install the Indigo package and got dependency errors so if someone has actually installed JBoss tools on Juno and in Mac OSX Mountain Lion, I could use some pointers on getting it done. Also be nice to know when the native Juno version of the tools may be available  :^0 Thank-you in advance for your help. BTW:  I am planning to develop in Grails/Groovy using JSP and want to explore the use of JSF (Java Server Faces) as well.  I am pretty new to this end of the spectrum of Java.</body>

    <body>If there is an active transaction when you make a call to getConnection the container will try to enlist the connection in the transaction. But I notice from the stack trace that you are trying to get the connection from an AfterCompletion synchronisation - ie the transaction has already finished (and that is why WrapperDataSource throws the exception). Is this what you are intending?</body>

After complete installation when I started the console I was able to start my process.Trust me there were no exceptions at all. Earlier I had  downloaded and installed jbpm 5.3 by running the commands seperately for every war which I need to deploy.I was able to start  my server and was able to log in into my jbpm console but wasn't able to start my processes. So you can try with the above solution.Hope it helps you. Regards Sachin</body>

    <body>I am looking to setup my jboss soa 5.2 server on my UNIX box and have followed the following steps. 1) Got a Unix user created with minimal access rights to logon and with some update permisisions. 2) unzipped Apache Ant and added the same to the PATH system variable. 3) unzipped "soa-p-5.2.0.GA.zip". 4) Created a oracle 11g database and associated an user with it. 5) Associated the oracle 11g database with the jboss server using the build.xml under tools/schema and as expected it created 117 tables in the database. 6) Now I logged onto the directory /home/a.b2cdev/jboss-soa-p-5/jboss-as/bin  to execute ./run.sh 7) The server logs flow fine for a minute and then doesn't flow ever after that, couldn't find anything in the logs nor on the console. Not sure what is stopping the process? Please assist!!! Attached the server.log, boot.log and putty_console.log In putty_console.log I forcefully exited the program at "22:01:14,088" - Please look for this timestamp on the logs.</body>

    <body>I do not see any symptom of hanging from the logs. Is your concern with respect to The server logs flow fine for a minute and then doesn't flow ever after that? Are you able to hit the server console in your web browser? The logs need not have to be flowing all the time. If you enable Debug logging then perhaps it would.</body>

    <body>You actually have a clean start, I thought the same thing when I first started setting up the SOA platform and thought it was getting stuck on: If you actually look in the logs, you will see: 2012-08-17 21:36:57,994 INFO  [org.jboss.bootstrap.microcontainer.ServerImpl] (main) JBoss (Microcontainer) [5.2.0.GA_SOA (build: SVNTag=5.2.0.GA_SOA date=201111090730)] Started in 1m:23s:702ms Which means the AS started up, however if you are running the machine on a remote box and are remotly accessing it from your desktop then you need to do the following when you start it up: /run.sh -b 0.0.0.0 This is to get the AS to bind to all IP's your device has, alternatively you can do -b yourIpAddress instead. Otherwise when you hit  http://yourIpAddress:8080 http://yourIpAddress:8080 you get nothing.</body>

    <body>Thanks Welsh... That really did help and now I am on my jboss console. This is easy to go and really good to see... Just to add for future references. I had now started the server with ./run.sh -b 0.0.0.0 and logged onto the console using  http://serverIpAddress:8080/ http://serverIpAddress:8080/ @Magesh - The halt of logs without showing a clear indication of server started - caused the confusion and made me feel me the server startup is yet to complete. moreover the  http://serverIpAddress:8080/ http://serverIpAddress:8080/  did not show up as mentioned by Welsh -Hitesh</body>

    <body>RE: Data Model To capture some extra information we discussed, it will be useful to maintain a separate table of participants that each participant record links to. We discussed the naming of the "ParticipantRecord" entity, initially we discounted "Branch" as this was determined as possibly too XA specific (tbd). To extend on this, there would be expected to be few "ResourceManager" rows, but many "ParticipantRecord" rows. We also discussed that we should maintain timestamps for everything, for example when the Transaction is created, prepared, suspended. This also implies we would probably want to keep a list of the state changes that the transaction has gone through rather than a single status field. I am not so sure about this, do we want to be able to replay the transaction state changes or give a view of the current transaction state (tbd). Also, the ParticipantRecord is only maintaining the "vote" field. It is possible that the record can be suspended/resumed, so I think maybe that needs a status field instead of vote field (perhaps a list if we are supporting replay). You are going to need to consider what a subordinate coordinator (JTS) is in the data model. In JTS it sits behind a participant style interface functionally but in this model I don't think you would want to record it as such. You can either use the Transaction table (add a nullable list of subordinate transactions and a nullable parent) or create a new table for it. Most properties would remain the same so tbd what the best course of action is. Related to this, we discussed how it would be possible when different nodes are processing their logs in parallel and submitting to the database, it would be possible that the subordinate coordinator was added before the parent so we need to consider how that would work. When a parent is added it will know the subordinates so you will know when you have the full picture.</body>

    <body>As you point out in the article, we should consider the performance implications of this. Perhaps we can provide a logger that doesn't write to file system but maybe sends the message off node for processing using a lightweight networking framework. We should consider the implication of lost log statements or out of order log statements as I guess log4j does not guarantee statements are written to disk. (It will be a background thread and won't be synced at a guess).</body>

Yes, but what about the performance impact on the rest of the system and users when this happens? Furthermore, define "fails" because if the application has told the transaction to rollback then the information needed is different to if the reaper forces it to rollback, for instance. Plus, maintaining data for all transactions throughout their life just so that it can be dumped out in the small case that the transaction rolls back seems of dubious benefit to the 99.99% of users who don't have failing transactions.</body>

    <body>Mark, I think this covers most of your comments above... I agree that gathering extensive information on every transaction is very costly. However, we are not proposing that this tool be used routinely in production. I think the sensible thing to do is to gather aggregate information in such a way that has minimal impact on the running system. We seem to have this mostly covered at the moment as we can obtain, rollback, commit and in-flight transaction counters. This is great for identifying the presence of a problem, but IMO, in many cases the user would then need to turn up the logging to establish the root cause of the problem. This is similar to how developers improve the performance of a system. Aggregate data (i.e. average throughput, average response times) is used to identify that we have a problem. The developer then attaches a profiler to identify the root cause of the performance problem. I see this tool more as a profiling tool to be used when the aggregate data has identified an issue. In which case, the overhead of gathering this data is less of an issue, assuming it doesn't impact the system to the point where it skews the data being gathered. The benefit of parsing the logs to get this data is that: 1) It can be done retrospectively from a user's log 2) We can automate the detection of common issues that would typically relied on a user/GSS/Transactions team person eye balling the logs. 3) We validate that the logs contain all the information required to detect these issues (assuming the right level is set). We were planning on having a meeting with the Transactions specialists in GSS to find out there views on this tool and to target some high priority issues that Alex could focus on for his prototype. In an ideal world, we'd like this tool to filter out more support issues at each level. I.e users discover the problem without needing to raise a support ticket; GSS discover the problem without having to contact the transactions team for help.</body>

    <body>Hi there, ok so which version of jBPM and Drools are you using? This class was in the drools-compiler.jar or in the drools-core.jar so make sure that you have all the required dependencies into your web application.. Cheers PS: el foro es en ingles y por lo general recomiendo que se escriba en ingles asi mucha mas gente te puede ayudar. Saludos!</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Audit Logging Design	Notes</header>
    <body>Design notes for work on https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-456 (formerly  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-444 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-444). My current development topic branch for this is  https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/tree/WFLY-456-audit-log https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/tree/WFLY-456-audit-log (More current than  https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/AS7-444 https://github.com/bstansberry/jboss-as/tree/AS7-444, note that these are personal branches; I make no guarantees not to change its commit history.)  This branch is based on work previously done by John Bailey. Design notes: 1) Processing location in OperationContext a) when done b) when decision to not proceed is made in OperationContext 2) Log record format: a) date b) read-only? c) boot? d) (if boot) version (as string???) e) rollback? f) userid (TODO get this somehow) g) uuid (for domain ops only, to track across processes) h) isServer? i) primary (domain or server) model hash j) if (!isServer) secondary (host) model hash k) overall hash l) num operations m) operations (one at a time) n) length of a-&gt;j (scan from end to last boot during validation; alternative is to write the length first and scan from beginning to last boot) 3) Index record format: a) overall hash 4) Mgmt operations a) truncate (back to last boot) i) don't discard previous; just write under a different file name b) read log (params -- from (default 0); batch-size (default 20; -1 means all)) c) validate log d) config changes 5) Validation: a) compare persisted model hash to current model b) scan back through log to last config-file-modified boot or version-change boot. We stop at version-change boot to avoid spurious validation problems resulting from changes in model construction across versions c) recreate by re-running ops -- validation problems a) need to verify model hash at each stage -- special controller that ignores all runtime ops   i) problem -- how to recreate domain ops involving remote slaves that don't exist?   ii) problem -- ops with attachments -- attachments won't exist   iii) this "special controller" could end up duplicating a lot of logic just for validation b) reads and runtime ops cannot be verified against model; it can only be confirmed that their hash is consistent with subsequent hashes in the log. Tamper resistant as modification would require modifying all subsequent log entries, but not tamper proof as this could be done. 6) Domain mode a) tracking requests from master to slaves apply a uuid to requests -- as a header include uuid in log record b) detecting host.xml config changes at boot problem -- can't detect host.xml config changes at boot, as model changes may be due to domain.xml stuff coming from the master so, independent domain and host logging but, what about non-model affecting ops? log twice? c) domain logging on slaves? only if --backup-dc is set? -- no simpler to just log d) remote-slave-only logging on master? yes, to maintain a complete record of what was done 7) Non-model-affecting ops a) re-calculating the model hash for all such ops is too expensive b) store the hash(es) in the ModelController along with the model c) provide the hash along with the model to OperationContext d) when model is updated recalc hashes 8) Config a) &lt;audit-log&gt; element b) part of &lt;management&gt; section c) resource is /core-service=audit-log d) attributes i) path (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) ii) relative-to (NO -- we need to know the location when first logging, before we have processed ops to set it) iii) log-read-only? iv) daily-rolling??? (hassle; tempting to defer to later release but it's probably necessary immediately) 9) Other issues a) disable logging overhead for dev scenarios   i) to disable it during initial boot (until whatever config element that turns it on/off is read) -- maintain log data in memory and only write on last boot op b) parallel boot handlers should not log c) fluctuating model hashes   i) if op took the controller lock, that lock ensures proper ordering of model hashes   ii) if op does not take controller lock (reads) earlier model hashes can intermix with later -- validation needs to account for this *Suggested configuration* Only relevant elements to audit logging have been included in the following examples. *+jboss-as-config (i.e. standlone.xml and host.xml)+ * This defines a set of audit-log-appenders which are referenced by the audit-log element. Having the audit-log-appenders defined seperately from the core audit-log, and the core audit-log referencing those appenders allows us to later allow separate appenders for the jmx subsystem. Currently encryption/tamper detection is not a requirement so all logs are done in clear text. If encryption/tamper detection later becomes a requirement this could be added by for example an audit-log-formatters section which configures whatever we would like to use for encryption/tamper detection and the file-audit-log-appender and syslog-audit-log-appender could individually be made to reference an audit-log-formatter.     &lt;xs:complexType name="domain-managementType"&gt;         &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                 Domain-wide default configuration settings for the management of standalone servers and a Host Controller.             &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;         &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;         &lt;xs:sequence&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="security-realms" minOccurs="0"&gt;                 &lt;xs:complexType&gt;                     &lt;xs:sequence&gt;                         &lt;xs:element name="security-realm" type="security-realmType" minOccurs="1"                                     maxOccurs="unbounded"/&gt;                     &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;                 &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;             &lt;/xs:element&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="outbound-connections" minOccurs="0"&gt;                 &lt;xs:complexType&gt;                     &lt;xs:sequence&gt;                         &lt;xs:element name="ldap" type="ldapType" minOccurs="1" /&gt; &lt;!-- TODO minOccurs only while ldap is only supported connection. --&gt;                     &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;                 &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;             &lt;/xs:element&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="audit-log" minOccurs="0"&gt;                 &lt;xs:complexType&gt;                     &lt;xs:sequence minOccurs="0"&gt;                         &lt;xs:element name="audit-log-appenders" type="audit-log-appendersType"/&gt;                         &lt;xs:element name="logger" type="audit-log-loggerType"/&gt;                     &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;                 &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;             &lt;/xs:element&gt;         &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;     &lt;xs:complexType name="audit-log-appendersType"&gt;         &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                 Declaration of management operation audit logging appenders.             &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;         &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;         &lt;xs:choice minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded"&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="file-appender" type="file-audit-log-appenderType"/&gt;             &lt;xs:element name="syslog-appender" type="syslog-audit-log-appenderType"/&gt;         &lt;/xs:choice&gt;     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;     &lt;xs:complexType name="file-audit-log-appenderType"&gt;         &lt;xs:annotation&gt;             &lt;xs:documentation&gt;                 Configuration of a simple file appender for the audit log.

    <body>The IP and interface are captured. The output in the simple file appender is: The sample output in syslog is For future releases I plan to support custom formatters, to allow you to choose the output format, and the formatter will be what provides things like tamper detection mechanisms (hashing, signing, encryption etc). For now I settled on a JSON formatter, but can change that to something different if desired. I like that it gives more structure than tabs etc. and the operations coded as model nodes map nicely to that. Also syslog does not like byte[] formatted data, it seems to have to be strings.</body>

    <body>Hey Bruno, I am receiving the same error Die you happen to resolve it? I tried to debug MyFaces and RichFaces but so far no look. The JavaScript library jsf.js is contained in META-INF/resources/myfaces/META-INF/resources/myfaces/api/jsf.js META-INF/resources/javax.faces/jsf.js META-INF/internal-resources/org.apache.myfaces.core.api/jsf.js in the myfaces-api-2.1.11.jar. My guess is, that those resource are not available to either RichFaces or MyFaces itself. I tried using &lt;filter&gt; in deployment-structure.xml to include the dependency to the new myfaces module and also used &lt;resource-root path="myfaces-api-2.1.11.jar"&gt;     &lt;filter&gt;         &lt;include path="META-INF/**"/&gt;     &lt;/filter&gt; &lt;/resource-root&gt; but no look so far.</body>

    <body>I have taken a look at this too and agree XAResource::end(TMSUCCESS) does seem to be called in all permutations. I wonder if TMFAIL might be more appropriate for topLevelAbort? However, I open this as a point of discussion, rather than suggestion. In practical terms I suspect it won't make any difference to the RM. Also, your description in "Other Spec Changes" omits the fact that  com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.transaction.arjunacore.TransactionImple::rollback(), endSuspendedRMs() is also invoked. Near as I can work out though, endSuspendedRMs is almost superflous as topLevel* will end ASSOCIATION_SUSPENDED branches anyway?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - How to auto delegate using	jbpm</header>
    <body>I have a requirement where I need to auto delegate a task to a delegatee. The business requirement is to verify in the DB and find out who are the valid delegatees for the current delegator(actorId) for the current duration. On node trigger event we need to check for the valid delegatee and auto assign/delegate this user to the task. We know that Jbpm allows us to do the delegation explicitly using delegate() method. We have the valid delegatee information from DB at the time of node triggered but inorder to delegate the task we need to have the taskId information which is not available in this node trigger event. This is because, task object might not have been created yet. public void delegate(*taskId*, userId, targetUserId) We can't even use taskClaimed event method because it is not getting triggerd in case where there is single actorId specified for the node(in bpmn). It is because Jbpm directly moves the node from task 'Created' to 'Reserved' status in this case. public void taskClaimed(TaskClaimedEvent event) So, I dont have any idea, how to implement our requirement. Please help us.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Narayana	Release Process</header>
    <body>This page provides a list of instructions that must be done *in order* when doing a release of Narayana. h2. Check JIRA 1. Check all issues resolved. 2. Create next point release version if not exists - this is so you can push issues in step 3 below. 3. Unresolved issues should be resolved or pushed. h2. Check Hudson Ensure no test failures in the group of hudson tests, for the branch you intend to release. h2. Raise AS7 component upgrade request in Jira Prepare for a PR to update AS7. 1.  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7 2. create a new 'component update' issue.1. Ensure the module is set to 'transactions' 2. select an appropriate 'fix for'. 3. Assign it to yourself. h2. Do Release h3.

I'm not certain where we would expose this; most likely under /core-service=platform-mbean/type=runtime.

    <body>This page provides a list of instructions that must be done *in order* when doing a release of Narayana. h2. Check JIRA 1. Check all issues resolved. 2. Create next point release version if not exists - this is so you can push issues in step 3 below. 3. Unresolved issues should be resolved or pushed. h2. Check Hudson Ensure no test failures in the group of hudson tests, for the branch you intend to release. h2. Raise AS7 component upgrade request in Jira Prepare for a PR to update AS7. 1.  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7 2. create a new 'component update' issue.1. Ensure the module is set to 'transactions' 2. select an appropriate 'fix for'. 3. Assign it to yourself. h2. Do Release h3.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Integration Tooling	Release Process</header>
    <body>h1. Overview This document details the process for building and releasing composite/aggregate update sites for the JBoss integration tooling (formerly SOA tools). h2. Goals * Provide a light-weight process with minimal overhead for component owners. * Provide an ever-current update site containing the latest, stable releases of integration tooling components. * Allow component owners to independently manage their release schedules. * Allow component owners to manage their own dependency stack. h2. Assumptions * Components use released versions of dependencies (i.e. stable builds). * Component owners manage their own interdependencies with other integration components. * Components and dependencies adhere to Eclipse API versioning rules. h2. Implications * Aggregate releases will be driven by component releases. * Aggregate releases should manage themselves. * Component nightly/milestone builds should always be compatible with other components in the aggregate. h2. Definitions * *Integration Stack (IS)* - all JBoss middleware integration tooling * *IS configuration* - the definition of specific components and versions that make up the IS * *IS build* - an update site (p2 repo) aggregating specific versions of integration tooling components. * *Release types:** *stable* - an IS build aggregating stable (i.e. final) builds of all components that has been certified/tested by QA. * *development* - an IS build aggregating stable builds of all components that has not been certified/tested by QA. * *integration* - an IS build aggregating stable, development (e.g. beta) and/or integration builds of all components * *next* - an internal IS build incorporating the latest integration builds of all components (i.e. the current "trunk" build).  This will be used for identifying potential future incompatibilities. Stable builds will align  with a JBDS release in the same way JBT core builds do today.  Development builds will reflect the current state of all stable components.  Theoretically, any development build could be QA'd and promoted to stable (assuming no test failures).  Integration builds allow for an "interim" stack which may be useful during a QA cycle (e.g. verifying a fix that requires updates to multiple components; a single component can be updated via the component update site).  Next builds are used to identify potential incompatiblilities among components before they are integrated into a release and would occur weekly/monthly via a Hudson job (e.g. targeting JBT integration builds). An IS build only needs to occur when the IS configuration changes.  Because the IS stack is composed of stable components, configuration changes will only occur when individual components are released.  For this reason, it is assumed the build would be invoked manually. h1. Roles and Responsibilities h2. Component Owners 1. *Component update site:*  Component owners must provide an update site for each release of their component that is included in an IS build. 2. *Updating IS configuration:*  Component owners must update the IS build configuration when a new version of their component is released.  This ensures the IS is up-to-date. 3. *Respond to change requests:*  Component owners must review IS configuration change requests and respond in a timely manner.  If a requested change is incompatible with the current version of your component, provide details regarding when your component will be compatible, along with a patch containing changes to the IS configuration for your compatible release. h2. Release Engineers 1. *Maintain build infrastructure:*  Release engineers will be responsible for maintianing the build infrastructure, primarily the Jenkins jobs. 2. *Processing pull requests:*  Release engineers will be responsible processing all pull requests related to IS configuration.  This is to ensure consistency in the composition of the stack (e.g. components, component versions, IS version, etc.). 3. *Initiate IS builds:*  Release engineers will be responsible for initiating IS builds. 4. *Build promotion:*  Release engineers will be responsible for the promotion of IS builds (e.g. from development to stable). h1. Release Process h2. Component Updates The following outlines the basic process for updating the IS configuration.  Typically, this would occur when a component is released, but the same process is also used for updating shared dependencies (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins, etc.). 1. Create a branch in the user repository for your IS configuration changes. 2. Modify the Integration Stack configuration for your updates, e.g. update URL for SwitchYard from 0.5.0.Final to 0.6.0.Final; update IS version from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (see versioning rules)1. For changes to your component within the community aggregate:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/compositeContent.xml compositeContent.xml files to point to the new component update site. 2. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/category.xml category.xml file as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify the project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/pom.xml pom.xml. 2. For changes to your component within the production aggregate:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/compositeContent.xml compositeContent.xml files to point to the new component update site. 2. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/category.xml category.xml file as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify the project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/pom.xml pom.xml. 3. For changes to dependencies:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform1. Modify  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/integration-stack-base.target integration-stack-base.target,  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/core-base.target core-base.target or  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/community.target community.target 2. Modify project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/pom.xml pom.xml 3. Ensure plugins are mirrored on jboss.org 3. Build locally to validate stack dependencies. 4. Create a  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS JBTIS JIRA task requesting update, e.g. update SwitchYard to 0.6.0.Final* Include link to github branch in task * Include build  results (e.g. SUCCESS or specific dependency resolution errors) 5. Create subtasks against each IS component for verification/approval* For components that failed the consistency check, mark subtasks appropriately, e.g. m2e-wtp version is inconsistent 6. Merge any changes required by other components from subtasks (e.g. update Savara to 2.1.0.Final) 7. Build IS locally to validate dependency consistency 8. Issue pull request against upstream IS configuration project 9. Process pull (by release engineer) 10. Invoke build job (by release engineer) h2. Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. JBoss Central Discovery Updates *Goal:* Modify the JBoss Central mylyn discovery install/update mechanism. JBoss Central, based on  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Discovery Mylyn Discovery, is in part a UI for installing new features into Eclipse or JBDS. It provides a richer, yet simpler UI than what the Eclipse equinox p2 install manager provides out of the box. For detailed information see  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-48297 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossCentralsSoftwareUpdateTab-HowDoesItWork 1. For changes to the jbosstools community discovery update:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/discovery https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/discovery or production discovery update:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/discovery https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/discovery follow the same git process as defined in the Components Updates section. 2. Modify the plugin connector descriptors and installation units as needed within the discovery plugin. 3. Add any icons that may be required. h2. Dependency Updates The process for updating a shared dependency is the same as that for updating any other component, with the following additions: 1. Make sure the dependency is mirrored on jboss.org. 2. Make sure the dependency is not already included through JBT core. If a dependency is included through JBT core, you will need to coordinate with the core team on the upgrade, as the change may impact components outside the IS. h2. Versioning Rules - major.minor.update.build *Major* should be updated for: * Base platform changes, e.g. Eclipse Indigo-&gt;Juno, JBT 3.3-&gt;4.0 * Major component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 1.0-&gt;2.0 *Minor* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5-&gt;0.6 *Update* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5.0-&gt;0.5.1 *Build* should be updated for each build, e.g. when building against nightly/integration/development repositories ** Note, the basic assumption here is that components are adhering to basic API rules (per Eclipse; e.g. minor includes bug fixes and api additions, major may include breaking api changes). h1. Update Site Locations * *Integration builds:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Development builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Stable builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* h1. Infrastructure * *JIRA -*  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS * *Source -*  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack* *target-platform* - provides a target platform defining all upstream dependencies for use by IS components (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins) * *aggregate-site* - provides category and feature definitions for the IS update site * *discovery* - provides JBoss Central discovery support * *Jenkins* - * *target platform* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-target-platform https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-target-platform * *aggregate* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-aggregate https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-aggregate * *aggregate publish/promote* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-aggregate-publish https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-aggregate-publish * *discovery* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-discovery https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-discovery * *install tests* -  https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-4.0_stable_branch.director-install-tests.eclipse42x.jbt40x.matrix https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/JBTIS-4.0_stable_branch.director-install-tests.eclipse42x.jbt40x.matrix h2. Target Platforms The provided target platforms define all upstream dependencies available to an IS component.  Two target platforms are provided: base and community.  The base target platform includes all dependencies which are also included as part of JBDS.  The community target extends the base target by including dependencies which are only available in  community JBT releases.  If your component needs to be included in a JBDS release, DO NOT use the community target platform.  For more information and an example on how to refer to the target platform definition, see:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/README.md h1. Future Plans 1. Add support for executing component unit tests as part of the aggregate build.  The goal being to help ensure the stability of the aggregate. 2. Add a "next" build that will build against upcoming core platforms (e.g. Kepler, JBT 4.1).  This should serve as an early warning system to identify platform incompatibilities early in the process.</body>

    <body>A question for server-groups is resources that are not directly referenced by the server-group (e.g. a profile) or contained by something directly referenced (e.g. a subsystem) but rather are only brought in via indirect references (e.g. a path or interface) or convention (e.g. system properties). My inclination would be any simple system where we allow restriction to a given server-group would restrict access to such resources. It's possible we could analyze the socket-binding-group resource and determine whether an interface is relevant.  I can't see doing that for paths or system properties.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Access control	notes</header>
    <body>Yes. The dynamic part is only relevant for read-resource (perhaps read-resource-description) where part of the result might be filtered. For something like read-attribute, the operation would fail if access was not allowed.</body>

    <body>One bit of feedback for a permission scheme that we've seen that goes beyond those listed above is a desire to restrict based on server groups. A rough thought on a simple expansion of the basic roles we create is to allow creation of a custom role that's based on one of our standard ones but is limited to a particular server group(s). &lt;custom-role base-role="operator"&gt;   &lt;server-group name="groupA"/&gt;   &lt;server-group name="groupB"/&gt; &lt;/custom-role&gt;</body>

    <body>Second try at this after the wiki turned my first one into a repost of the main article... Sorry, Heiko, this page was really notes to myself and wasn't really in a state for publication. But word of it got out into the wild and it needed to be made visible. I'll try and clean it up today. The initial timing part was very much notes to myself. I do believe that's reasonable for a design phase though. About "Request Attributes"... The basic idea I had in mind is that authorization decisions would be made by some sort of authorization engine. The AS would define an SPI for this engine with an available set of inputs that would be provided to the engine and an expected set of outputs -- permit, deny, perhaps other stuff like the XACML "obligations" notion. The inputs would be from 4 broad categories 1) Information about the operation. 2) Information about the resource being accessed 3) Information about the caller 4) General environmental stuff, e.g. time of day, interface the call came in on, etc. +(This last is conceptual only and not something I propose dealing with in AS 8)+ The "Request Attributes" bits above are notes to myself to identify what stuff from categories 1) and 2) above we would need to provide to a rules engine to provide sufficient input for a set of rules that map to the various "roles" concepts that we've seen in different permission schemes we've heard about. It's basically thought on how to pursue the "Rules based approach" in the wiki article Anil linked. The idea I had at its core is the authorization system could be as flexibile as the rule grammar and the available inputs will allow. Directly configuring the set of rules allows the user the maximum flexibility. This is not something I see as being in scope for AS 8 though. For AS 8 (and forever really) we need a simplified system with a limited number of config options that internally generates (or statically defines) a set of rules that results in behavior like one of the schemes I listed. So, if user is in role "Operator", the rules would verify whether the operation is read-only, whether the resource or attribute description has a security restriction associated etc. Basically, the simplified system is a shorthand way of expressing a fairly complex set of rules in a user-friendly fashion. For the future, we can see if there are other, more flexibile shorthands for creating rules (e.g. a regex scheme.) Or, if appropriate we can provide direct configurability of the rules engine.</body>

    <body>h1. Objective By early September to implement a simplified domain management access control solution suitable for both AS 8 and EAP 6.x. The primary objective is to establish a simple set of roles with which users can be associated, with clear sets of operation execution permissions associated with each role. The second critical objective is to develop an architecture for authorization that will allow for a much more generic/flexible authorization scheme to be implemented in future releases without breaking the simple scheme we do now. Actually providing a generic scheme is out of scope for AS 8. h1.

Resource and Action Attributes The following describes attributes required as inputs to a authorization mechanism, which that mechanism would use to enforce some permission schemes we've heard of. The assumption was the authorization mechanism would be some form of Attribute Based Access Control, although the use of ABAC is not a requirement. The terms "Resource Attributes" and "Action Attributes" is derived from the XACML spec, which notes that "Information security policies operate upon attributes of subjects, the resource, the action and the environment in order to arrive at an authorization decision." This section is concerned with identifying relevant attributes of the management resources toward which an operations is targetted, as well as the relevant attributes of the operation itself.

    <body>Good day! My application is running fine in Glass fish 2.1. It is .ear file. I am using more configuration file like xsl,xsd,apache log4j xml and some property files to my application. So I have created shared library in my disk say C:/SharedLib and put all my configuration files in this location. In glassfish I will give this location in my Application Server--&gt;JVM settings--&gt;path settings --&gt; Classpath prefix ---&gt; C:/SharedLib I will use all the property files,jar files and xsl,xsd from that location(C:/SharedLib. My application (.ear ) contains ejb and war file. My question is how i can use same configuration in my Jboss 7.1.3? Is there any way without changing my code in my application .ear?</body>

    <body>In the general tasks section there are a couple of lines mentioning "Enforce Permissions" in web console and CLI - I would suggest there should be no mention on client side enforcement as that is just not enforcement - all of that needs to be on the server side. What these clients do need is appropriate meta data to be returned to allow them to be able to still run intuitively against the server.  The alternative is each client needs to be updated to understand the permissions model and act accordingly, the down side of this is now we need to maintain it in multiple locations with This in turn implies to me that anything server side needs to be more than just enforcement i.e. performing an authorization check at the time of an attempt to access the model / execute an operation is the bare minimum - we potentially need to be able to go beyond this to pro-actively identify what can or can not be accessed. As we have mentioned previously for any permissions schema to be secure it needs to be understandable, one possibility here is to look at ways to show the effect of the currently defined permissions scheme on the domain model.  This could be something along the lines of generating a report which visualises the tree and highlights what can and can not be accessed by a specific user / role - alternatively social networks commonly have a view profile as option to see what others can see, this could be a mode to consider in the console. Some of these items might be out of scope for this phase of development but just wanted to raise them so we can at least take them into account.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Integration Tooling	Release Process</header>
    <body>h1. Overview This document details the process for building and releasing composite/aggregate update sites for the JBoss integration tooling (formerly SOA tools). h2. Goals * Provide a light-weight process with minimal overhead for component owners. * Provide an ever-current update site containing the latest, stable releases of integration tooling components. * Allow component owners to independently manage their release schedules. * Allow component owners to manage their own dependency stack. h2. Assumptions * Components use released versions of dependencies (i.e. stable builds). * Component owners manage their own interdependencies with other integration components. * Components and dependencies adhere to Eclipse API versioning rules. h2. Implications * Aggregate releases will be driven by component releases. * Aggregate releases should manage themselves. * Component nightly/milestone builds should always be compatible with other components in the aggregate. h2. Definitions * *Integration Stack (IS)* - all JBoss middleware integration tooling * *IS configuration* - the definition of specific components and versions that make up the IS * *IS build* - an update site (p2 repo) aggregating specific versions of integration tooling components. * *Release types:** *stable* - an IS build aggregating stable (i.e. final) builds of all components that has been certified/tested by QA. * *development* - an IS build aggregating stable builds of all components that has not been certified/tested by QA. * *integration* - an IS build aggregating stable, development (e.g. beta) and/or integration builds of all components * *next* - an internal IS build incorporating the latest integration builds of all components (i.e. the current "trunk" build).  This will be used for identifying potential future incompatibilities. Stable builds will align  with a JBDS release in the same way JBT core builds do today.  Development builds will reflect the current state of all stable components.  Theoretically, any development build could be QA'd and promoted to stable (assuming no test failures).  Integration builds allow for an "interim" stack which may be useful during a QA cycle (e.g. verifying a fix that requires updates to multiple components; a single component can be updated via the component update site).  Next builds are used to identify potential incompatiblilities among components before they are integrated into a release and would occur weekly/monthly via a Hudson job (e.g. targeting JBT integration builds). An IS build only needs to occur when the IS configuration changes.  Because the IS stack is composed of stable components, configuration changes will only occur when individual components are released.  For this reason, it is assumed the build would be invoked manually and there is not reason for a nightly build. h1. Roles and Responsibilities h2. Component Owners 1. *Component update site:*  Component owners must provide an update site for each release of their component that is included in an IS build. 2. *Updating IS configuration:*  Component owners must update the IS build configuration when a new version of their component is released.  This ensures the IS is up-to-date. 3. *Respond to change requests:*  Component owners must review IS configuration change requests and respond in a timely manner.  If a requested change is incompatible with the current version of your component, provide details regarding when your component will be compatible, along with a patch containing changes to the IS configuration for your compatible release. h2. Release Engineers 1. *Maintain build infrastructure:*  Release engineers will be responsible for maintianing the build infrastructure, primarily the Jenkins jobs. 2. *Processing pull requests:*  Release engineers will be responsible processing all pull requests related to IS configuration.  This is to ensure consistency in the composition of the stack (e.g. components, component versions, IS version, etc.). 3. *Initiate IS builds:*  Release engineers will be responsible for initiating IS builds. 4. *Build promotion:*  Release engineers will be responsible for the promotion of IS builds (e.g. from development to stable). h1. Release Process h2. Component Updates The following outlines the basic process for updating the IS configuration.  Typically, this would occur when a component is released, but the same process is also used for updating shared dependencies (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins, etc.). 1. Create a branch in the user repository for your IS configuration changes. 2. Modify the Integration Stack configuration for your updates, e.g. update URL for SwitchYard from 0.5.0.Final to 0.6.0.Final; update IS version from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (see versioning rules)1. For changes to your component within the community aggregate:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/compositeContent.xml compositeContent.xml files to point to the new component update site. 2. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/category.xml category.xml file as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify the project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/pom.xml pom.xml. 2. For changes to your component within the production aggregate:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/compositeContent.xml compositeContent.xml files to point to the new component update site. 2. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/category.xml category.xml file as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify the project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/pom.xml pom.xml. 3. For changes to dependencies:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform1. Modify  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/integration-stack-base.target integration-stack-base.target,  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/core-base.target core-base.target or  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/community.target community.target. The integration-stack-base and core-base combine to include all dependencies which are included as part of JBDS.  See the generated aggregate-base.target in your repository.  The community target extends the base target by including dependencies which are only available in community JBT releases (aggregate-full.target).                          e.g. I need to update to graphiti 0.9.2: 0.0.0.1. fork/branch/modify  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/integration-stack-base.target integration-stack-base.target 0.0.0.2. update the version of graphiti 0.0.0.3. verify that the updated version is being mirrored correctly on jboss.org 0.0.1. Modify project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/pom.xml pom.xml 0.0.2. Ensure plugins are mirrored on jboss.org 1. Build locally to validate stack dependencies. 2. Create a  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS JBTIS JIRA task requesting update, e.g. update SwitchYard to 0.6.0.Final* Include link to github branch in task * Include build  results (e.g. SUCCESS or specific dependency resolution errors) 3. Create subtasks against each IS component for verification/approval* For components that failed the consistency check, mark subtasks appropriately, e.g. m2e-wtp version is inconsistent 4. Merge any changes required by other components from subtasks (e.g. update Savara to 2.1.0.Final) 5. Build IS locally to validate dependency consistency 6. Issue pull request against upstream IS configuration project 7. Process pull (by release engineer) 8. Invoke build job (by release engineer) h2. Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. JBoss Central Discovery Updates *Goal:* Modify the JBoss Central mylyn discovery install/update mechanism. JBoss Central, based on  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Discovery Mylyn Discovery, is in part a UI for installing new features into Eclipse or JBDS. It provides a richer, yet simpler UI than what the Eclipse equinox p2 install manager provides out of the box. For detailed information see  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-48297 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossCentralsSoftwareUpdateTab-HowDoesItWork 1. For changes to the jbosstools community discovery update:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/discovery https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/discovery or production discovery update:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/discovery https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/discovery follow the same git process as defined in the Components Updates section. 2. Modify the plugin connector descriptors and installation units as needed within the discovery plugin. 3. Add any icons that may be required. h2. Dependency Updates The process for updating a shared dependency is the same as that for updating any other component, with the following additions: 1. Make sure the dependency is mirrored on jboss.org. 2. Make sure the dependency is not already included through JBT core. If a dependency is included through JBT core, you will need to coordinate with the core team on the upgrade, as the change may impact components outside the IS. h2. Versioning Rules - major.minor.update.build *Major* should be updated for: * Base platform changes, e.g. Eclipse Indigo-&gt;Juno, JBT 3.3-&gt;4.0 * Major component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 1.0-&gt;2.0 *Minor* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5-&gt;0.6 *Update* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5.0-&gt;0.5.1 *Build* should be updated for each build, e.g. when building against nightly/integration/development repositories ** Note, the basic assumption here is that components are adhering to basic API rules (per Eclipse; e.g. minor includes bug fixes and api additions, major may include breaking api changes). h1. Update Site Locations * *Integration builds:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Development builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Stable builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* h1.

Target Platforms The provided target platforms define all upstream dependencies available to an IS component.  Three target platforms are provided:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/integration-stack-base.target integration-stack-base.target,  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/core-base.target core-base.target and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/community.target community.target (see Component Updates above).   If your component needs to be included in a JBDS release, DO NOT use the community target platform.  For more information and an example on how to refer to the target platform definition, see:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/README.md h1. Future Plans 1. Add support for executing component unit tests as part of the aggregate build.  The goal being to help ensure the stability of the aggregate. Add a "next" build that will build against upcoming core platforms (e.g. Kepler, JBT 4.1).  This should serve as an early warning system to identify platform incompatibilities early in the process</body>

    <body>Agreed; we need another term. This is what I was getting at with read-resource-access op (an op to learn about user's ability to use API; based on read-resource-description) + uses ++ general information ++ allow caller to disable features that will be non-functional (e.g. buttons for misc ops that are not available) My assumption is the admin console will need something like this to provide a proper UI. If it does a read-resource, a response header associated with the response can indicate that certain attributes or children were filtered out due to access control reasons, so the console can take action when it renders the screen. But to know that the "Test JDBC Connection" button should be disabled or hidden, the console will need to know that the op is not allowed, and that won't come from any existing op. The report thing you mention could be a twist on this with parameter(s) to set the "view as" value. Perhaps a different op but with shared implementation details.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Disabling application deployment in JBoss AS 7</header>
    <body>I have a deployment architecture spanning in two different environments say X and Y. X has a standalone JBoss AS 7 and Y has a separate standalone JBoss AS 7. We have application abc.war and xyz.war and as part of the build process we copy both war file to a deployment directory from where the hot deployment happens. My questions is is there a way where I can define to deploy abc.war and xyz.war in server X and abc.war in server Y or can we disable a specific deployment. My experience with OC4J and Oracle Weblogic servers allows us to specify a disable flag that would not let the application deploy. Thanks, Arul Prashanth.</body>

    <body>Not via the deployment scanner, no. You can upload a deployment to the server via the CLI but not have it deployed though: Note the "enabled" attribute. Later you could use the CLI to trigger the deployment:</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much</header>
    <body>I'm using this article as a place for people to review a blog post I'm preparing. The plan is to base my JUDCon:Boston talk roughly on this blog post. In addition to this theory, my presentation will include plenty of code examples for each of the scenarios. These code examples will demonstrate the current design of the compensations API. I'll also be adding sections at the end to explain what we have implemented so far and our future roadmap. My current thoughts are that this text is too long for a blog post. h1. Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much ACID transactions are a useful tool for application developers and can provide very strong guarantees, even in the presence of failures. However, ACID transactions are not always appropriate for every situation. ACID transactions are achieved by holding locks on resources and require the ability to rollback changes. In some situations, the blocking nature of the protocol can be too limiting to performance, especially if the transaction is distributed. Also, some actions can’t simply be rolled back; for example, sending an email. A common strategy for applications that can’t use ACID, is to throw out transactions altogether. However, with this approach you are missing out on many of the benefits that transactions can provide. There are alternative transaction models that relax some of the ACID properties, while still retaining many of the strong guarantees essential for building robust enterprise applications. These should be considered before deciding not to use transactions at all. In a recent post I talked about the work we are doing, in the Narayana project, to improve support for compensation-based transactions. In this post I’ll show how this technology can be applied to scenarios in which ACID transactions are frequently seen as inappropriate. What is a ‘Compensation-based transaction’? In an ACID transaction, changes are not visible outside of the transaction until it completes. An atomic outcome is guaranteed using a two-phase protocol in which locks are obtained prior to the first phase and released in the second phase. The transaction manager guarantees an atomic outcome, even in the presence of failures. In a compensation-based transaction, changes are visible outside of the transaction as soon as they are made. If any of the participants are unsuccessful, the transaction compensates those participants that have already completed their work. This compensation action is application specific and is required to ‘undo’ the changes made by the transaction. Similarly to the ACID transaction, the transaction manager guarantees an atomic outcome, even in the presence of failures. h4. When are Compensation-based Transactions a good fit? h6. Non-transactional work ACID transactions rely on the work supporting rollback. This is fine for work that interacts with transactional resources, such as databases or message queues. However actions like sending an email cannot be rolled back. Here a compensation-based transaction can be used as an alternative. In this case the compensation action is to send another email notifying the recipient of the final outcome. Alternatively, you may have multiple XA (two-phase) aware resources, but due to performance reasons you need to run them in one-phase mode. Maybe you have a combination of transactional and non-transactional work. In this case the transactional work can be rolled back, if required, whilst the non-transactional resources are compensated. Also, you may have transactional resources or services, but, for whatever reason, they will not participate in an existing transaction. This can occur when you try to compose multiple services outside of your control. For example, a travel agent application may compose a transaction of calls to third party services. Providing these services offer an interface for cancelling (compensating) a booking, you should be able to use a compensation-based transaction to coordinate them. If you find yourself needing to coordinate multiple non-transactional tasks, you should consider using compensations. h6. Cross-Domain Distributed Transactions When your application becomes distributed, you greatly increase the chances of failure. Many of these failures can be tolerated by using a distributed ACID transaction. However, this approach is often dismissed as impractical for a number of reasons. The first is that distributed transactions tend to take longer to run, due to the increased communication latency. This can cause big problems for your throughput as the duration of held locks greatly increases. The second issue is that all the servers in the distributed transaction become tightly-coupled. Furthermore, the server that begun the transaction has full control over when the transaction should complete (ignoring the option of making a heuristic decision, which is really bad!). This may be acceptable if all the servers reside in the same business domain, but it’s rarely acceptable for cross-business domain applications. Compensation-based transactions can be used to solve both of these problems. The latency imposed by the distributed transaction does not result in holding of locks for extended periods as the work is completed immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the transaction. If this work was a database update, it would be committed immediately. A second database update would be made to undo the change, should compensation be required. Compensation-based transactions also encourage a loosely-coupled architecture as each participant offers a more natural interface to the coordinator. For example, in a flight booking example, the service interface would consist of ‘bookFlight’ and ‘cancelFlight’ operations (‘cancel’ being the compensating action). h6. Long Lived Transactions (LLT) ACID transactions are not particularly well suited for transactions that take a long time to run. This is because they acquire locks on resources as they progress and don’t release them until the transaction completes. In the meantime, other transactions, requiring that data, are blocked. Furthermore, a failure of a long running transaction results in the loss of all work completed so far. A compensation-based transaction can be composed of multiple short-lived ACID transactions. When each transaction completes, it releases the locks on the data it held, allowing other transactions, requiring that data, to proceed. A compensation action is registered for each ACID transaction. These actions are invoked, in reverse order, for all completed transactions, should the LLT need to be aborted. Furthermore, should one of these short-lived transactions fail, it could be possible to find an alternative, preventing the entire transaction from failing, and allowing forward progress to be achieved. Also, in some situations, as the transaction progresses, you may decide to abort just part of the transaction. For example, take a travel booking example. We begin by booking a flight. We then try to book a taxi, but that fails. At this point we don’t want to compensate the flight as it may be fully-booked next time we try. Therefore we try to find an alternative Taxi, which in this example succeeds. Later, in the LLT, we may find a cheaper flight, in which case we want to cancel the original flight whilst keeping the taxi and booking the cheaper flight. In this case we notify our intentions to the transaction manager who ensures that the more expensive flight is compensated when the LLT completes. h6. Conclusion In this blog post I’ve introduced the concept of a compensation-based transaction and showed how it could be used to provide strong guarantees in situations that are not applicable for ACID transactions. Most of what is discussed here is already supported through our WS-BA implementation. We are currently in the process of decoupling this technology from Web Services and improving the developer API.</body>

    <body>Hello Anil - this article is good and highlights the next areas I will look into for integration, however one small point. I would suggest not placing 'Interceptor Mechanism' as a requirement, that is an implementation detail.  The Authenticator/Valve intercetpro approach is one of the main reasons it was very difficult to combine authentication mechanisms in the past - what we really need is integration of these three items with the Undertow mechanisms.</body>

    <body>I am finding it hard to find a single word to describe the client side but I think safer terminology might be along the lines of: - "Interpretation of the security configuration for the current user to provide an intuitive user interface." As we design the feature this could range all the way from duplicating all authorization code in all consoles to identify what a user can access through to having sufficient meta-data provided by the management interfaces to make the decisions.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss ESB Development] - Re: StaticWireTap and	invmScope</header>
    <body>Hi Magesh, Pardon me for not replying back earlier.  I think we have identified what was causing the StaticWireTap'ped service to be not invoked. We had this staticWireTap action in the action pipeline where the first action was ensuring a Asynchronous delivery. Basically this Asynchronous delivery action had processException method, which upon exception rolls back the transaction. It seemed like, in case of unhappy path (that somewhere in the action pipeline there was an exception), the Static wire tap'ped service was not called - yes, I tested by having break points. It was probably queued to be called but was not called, possibly due to an exception in one of actions in the parent service. The wiretapped service was being called in case of happy path, without any issue. We are probably going to remedy this by having another top level service whose job is to basically wiretap twice, once in to the parent service and have another wiretap to the service which needed to be wiretapped in first place. Regards Soltar</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Using jBPM to create process workflow on web page</header>
    <body>Hello, We found jBPM an interesting to fit in our requirement. As specified in docs, the process flow can be created in one of the following way: 1. 1.    Using the graphical process editor in the Eclipse plugin 2. *2.    As an XML file, according to the XML process format as defined in the XML Schema Definition in the BPMN 2.0 specification.* 3. 3.    By directly creating a process using the Process API. We are more interested in the specifying the XML schema for our process and have the process workflow created on Web page. The technology we need to use is Java. So we would like to know : * Whether jBPM provides the functionality to render flowchart on web page? * Does jBPM creates the JPG/BMP image of process and renders on web page? Based on your reply, It would help us whether we can go for jBPM or not. Thanks &amp; Regards Ganesh +91-9011038429</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Re: Using jBPM to create process workflow on web page</header>
    <body>Hi, if your goals is to create the bpmn2 xml file in a web editor you should use the process designer, which will allow you to graphically build your process and in the back it will generate the bpmn2 xml file. It will also allow you to export the diagram as a PNG/SVG file, then converting it to a JPG/BMP should be straight forward. Cheers</body>

    <body>Thank for the reply   https://community.jboss.org/people/salaboy21 Mauricio Salatino. Will go through the process designer. Actually we do not want to save the flowchart in any image format. Our requirement is as below: -  Actually we want to show clicak guideline as a flowchart  on web page. Clinical guideline is different stages of patient. -  Define schema in XML file and render it as flowchart blocks on web page. - After rendering user should be able to add and delete flowchart controls and the same shld be saved again to the same xml file. Will process designer help in achieveing this? Cheers</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Re: Using jBPM to create process workflow on web page</header>
    <body>I don't understand what your requirements are. Do you want to have executable processes? or just the the diagrams for documentation purposes? You mention JPG and BMP which are image formats, but then you said that you don't want to save the flowchart in any image format. I don't understand what this is: "Actually we want to show clicak guideline as a flowchart  on web page" I'm guessing that is some kind of clinical flowchart for a patient, which makes me thing that you want to execute the process for each patient. Define schema in XML file and render it as flowchart blocks on web page -&gt; What exactly do you want to render? After rendering user should be able to add and delete flowchart controls -&gt; What do you mean by flowcharts controls? Cheers</body>

    <body>Define schema in XML file and render it as flowchart blocks on web page -&gt; What exactly do you want to render? *It means you define the clinical guideline for a patient as a XML schema.  Then jBPM engine should dynamically create the flowchart on webpage as per teh schema. It should display the flowchart.* After rendering user should be able to add and delete flowchart controls -&gt; What do you mean by flowcharts controls? *Flowchart controls means each node of flowchart i,e the rectangluar box , decision box etc.* *The funcitonality like, user should be able to delete any box on the fly and schema shld be updated. If user want to modify  guideline, the same can be added/deleted on the fly.* *cheers* * * * *</body>

    <body>Ganesh, Look at the jbpm process designer and see if that it does all what you need. Just for you to know, there is no need to create the XML schema by hand, you can just draw the process and it will automatically generate the XML file for you. Cheers</body>

The user group call back takes them by itself. All you need is to register the UserGroupCallback via UserGroupCallbackManager. You could use a property file to specify the mapping between the users and roles in the format : userid1=group1,group2,group3 userid2=group4,group3,group1 userid3=group1,group2 ... ... And specify the path of this file in your CustomUserGroupCallBack. So wehn you call the method *taskClient.getTasksAssignedAsPotentialOwner ( http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true String userId,   http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true String language,  http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v5.4/javadocs/org/jbpm/task/service/TaskClientHandler.TaskSummaryResponseHandler.html TaskClientHandler.TaskSummaryResponseHandler responseHandler)* This will invoke the callback and will take the groups for the userId.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Narayana	Release Process</header>
    <body>This page provides a list of instructions that must be done *in order* when doing a release of Narayana. h2. Check JIRA 1. Check all issues resolved. 2. Create next point release version if not exists - this is so you can push issues in step 3 below. 3. Unresolved issues should be resolved or pushed. h2. Check Hudson Ensure no test failures in the group of hudson tests, for the branch you intend to release. h2. Raise AS7 component upgrade request in Jira Prepare for a PR to update AS7. 1.  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7 2. create a new 'component update' issue.1. Ensure the module is set to 'transactions' 2. select an appropriate 'fix for'. 3. Assign it to yourself. h2. Do Release h3. Git Branches (4.17 and 5 only) Must be done first as the build-release-packages.xml relies on the tag being available cd $NARAYAN_SRC/scripts pre-release.sh &lt;next version, e.g: 5.0.0.M3&gt; h3.

Maven &amp; Java Memory Configuration To configure the amount of memory used by Maven, you can define MVN_OPTS as follows, either in the mvn / mvn.bat script you use to run Maven, or set as global environment variables.

Verify or Install? mvn verify will perform all build and test steps, but it won't install the bundles in your local repository. mvn install does install in you local repository. When an eclipse-plugin is installed in your repo, it is always used as default when resolving dependency. It is not possible to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, mvn verify is to be prefered to mvn install. However, if you want to build stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use mvn install. In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if your use-case requires it. +*What if I've already built something locally, but I want to build against the server version instead of my local repo?*+ There are  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform#Locally_built_artifacts two approaches that work here: a) override temporarily when building, using -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore b) delete ~/.m2/repository/.meta/p2-local-metadata.properties h2. About Target Platform and related profiles The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from this TP are allowed to be used in code. If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&amp;summary=Add%20[YOUR%20REQ]%20to%20Target%20Platform&amp;components=12310540&amp;issuetype=13&amp;Create=Create open a ticket to request it. Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's up to you to choose the one that match your needs: h3. Using published Target Platform definition (Recommended) unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target Platform repository. * Pros:* No additional thing to do than invoking Maven * Always up-to-date * Cons: Speed - (to evaluate) Consume it by adding *-Punified.target* to you Maven invocation command-line h3. Or, getting a local copy of the Target Platform * Pros: Speed +++ * Cons: Step to be repeated whenever  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build/tree/master/target-platforms target platforms change h4. Get it h5.  Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder on your disk. Just remember to update your  #settings.xml settings.xml file to point at the location where you unpacked it. You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as wget or curl at the following url: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/e420-wtp340.target.zip e420-wtp340.target.zip (current minimum TP) http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/e421-wtp341.target.zip e421-wtp341.target.zip (current maximum TP) and then unzip it : unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/jbosstools-build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR0c/multiple/target/multiple.target.repo/   or unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/jbosstools-build/target-platforms/jbosstools-JunoSR1a/multiple/target/multiple.target.repo/ h5. OR, use Maven to build it See  #maven-nexus-resolution-problems Building Parent Pom &amp; Target Platforms Locally #maven-nexus-resolution-problems  # h4. Use it as a Maven mirror Once you get the target platform available locally, you can use it instead of the remote sites to save time. For this, we can simply use Tycho target-platform mirroring:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors As example, you can simply edit to your ~/.m2/settings.xml the definition of the repositories to mirror: (replace /home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/.... by a path where your local repository actuaaly stands) &lt;settings&gt;      &lt;mirrors&gt; &lt;!-- IMPORTANT: Sites in target platforms: must not have trailing slash! --&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/e420-wtp340.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbosstools-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/e421-wtp341.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR0c&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR0c/jbds600-e420-wtp340.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;         &lt;mirror&gt;             &lt;id&gt;jenkins.jbdevstudio-JunoSR1a&lt;/id&gt;             &lt;mirrorOf&gt;http://www.qa.jboss.com/binaries/RHDS/updates/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/REPO&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;             &lt;url&gt;file:///home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/jbds-target-platform_4.0.juno.SR1a/jbds600-e421-wtp341.target/&lt;/url&gt;             &lt;layout&gt;p2&lt;/layout&gt;             &lt;mirrorOfLayouts&gt;p2&lt;/mirrorOfLayouts&gt;         &lt;/mirror&gt;     &lt;/mirrors&gt; &lt;/settings&gt; h2. (Optional) Build parent and target platform This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or the target platforms and want to test local changes. Otherwise, Maven will simply retrieve parent and TP definitions from  *https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/ JBoss Nexus* to perform your build. See  #maven-nexus-resolution-problems Building Parent Pom &amp; Target Platforms Locally Sometimes, Maven can't find the upstream artifacts - parent pom, tycho plugins, minimum (Juno SR0) or maximum (Juno SR1 or later) target platforms. Or maybe you want to build them locally in order to see how Tycho builds them, or contribute a fix. To work around resolution problems, just build locally: cd /tmp; git clone  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-maven-plugins git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-maven-plugins.git cd /tmp; git clone  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build.git cd jbosstools-maven-plugins/tycho-plugins; mvn install; cd - cd jbosstools-build/parent;  mvn install; cd - cd jbosstools-build/target-platforms; mvn install -Pjbosstools-minimum,jbosstools-maximum h2. Building Individual Components Locally Via Commandline h3. Build a component resolving to a recent aggregation build for other JBT dependencies (Recommanded) * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * Speed to resolve deps: + * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons:* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change. More risk to get out of sync than with the staging site. Tracked by  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516 example: *cd jbosstools-server* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-staging-aggregate* h3. Build a component resolving to the latest CI builds for other JBT dependencies * Pros:* You build only your component * You only need source for your component * You get generally the latest build for you component * Cons* Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component * Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a component you rely on and had some important change * Speed to resolve deps: - This profile is the one use for CI builds on Hudson. *cd jbosstools-server* mvn verify -P unified.target *-Pjbosstools-nightly-staging-composite* h3. Build a component along with all its dependencies from sources ("bootstrap" build) This will build exactly what you have locally * Pros:* You are sure of the version of sources that is used for your JBT dependencies * You don't loose time in resolving your JBT deps * Cons:* You need sources for your dependencies too * You often build more stuff that what you really want to test cd ~/trunk/jbosstools-server mvn verify  -P unified.target -*Pbootstrap* h2. Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline *LINUX / MAC USERS* cd jbosstools-build mvn clean install -gs ~/.m2/settings.xml | tee build.all.log.txt (tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file so you can watch the build AND keep a log.) *WINDOWS USERS* cd c:\trunk\jbosstools-build    or Remember to adjust your  #settings.xml settings.xml file to specify where you have your local target platform mirror built (or where you downloaded &amp; unpacked a target platform zip. Windows users, if you don't have a .m2 folder, see  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081617/missing-maven-m2-folder this article. h2. Building Locally In Eclipse First, you must have installed m2eclipse into your Eclipse (or JBDS). You can install the currently supported version from this update site: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/juno/ Next, start up Eclipse or JBDS and do *File &gt; Import* to import the project(s) you already checked out from SVN above into your workspace. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13876/Screenshot.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13876/Screenshot.png Browse to where you have the project(s) checked out, and select a folder to import pom projects. In this case, I'm importing the parent pom (which refers to the target platform pom). Optionally, you can add these new projects to a working set to collect them in your Package Explorer view. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13877/Screenshot-1.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13877/Screenshot-1.png Once the project(s) are imported, you'll want to build them. You can either do *CTRL-SHIFT-X,M (Run Maven Build),* or right-click the project and select *Run As &gt; Maven Build*. The following screenshots show how to configure a build job. First, on the *Main* tab, set a *Name*, *Goals*, *Profile*(s), and add a *Parameter*. Or, if you prefer, put everything in the *Goals* field for simplicity: clean install -B -fae -e Be sure to check *Resolve Workspace artifacts*, and, if you have a newer version of Maven installed, point your build at that *Maven Runtime* instead of the bundled one that ships with m2eclipse. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13878/Screenshot-2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13878/Screenshot-2.png On the *JRE* tab, make sure you're using a 6.0 JDK. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13879/Screenshot-3.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13879/Screenshot-3.png On the *Refresh* tab, define which workspace resources you want to refresh when the build's done. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13880/Screenshot-4.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13880/Screenshot-4.png On the *Common* tab, you can store the output of the build in a log file in case it's particularly long and you need to refer back to it. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13881/Screenshot-5.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13881/Screenshot-5.png Click *Run* to run the build. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-16604-63-13882/Screenshot-6.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-16604-63-13882/Screenshot-6.png Now you can repeat the above step to build any other component or plugin or feature or update site from the JBoss Tools repo. Simply import the project(s) and build them as above. h2. Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance. Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg., jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools-server/site/target/server.site-*.zip! or file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools-server/site/target/repository/, and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream components to install, eg., jbosstools-server depends on jbosstools-base, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can use: 1.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ (Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily - *bleeding edge*) 2.  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/ (Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins - *bleedinger edge*) 3.  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/ (see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you built locally - *bleedingest edge*) h2. Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component Need to tweak a component to add a new plugin or feature? See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AddingAPluginandorFeatureToAnExistingComponent. h2. Dealing with timeouts for tests (To be rewritten soon...)  http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/2012-September/005835.html h2. Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky compared to Eclipse PDE. h3. Check your build.properties Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse, you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources. You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings. Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..* and *output..* -- these are needed to  *http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source generate source plugins and features*. * * source.. = src/  output.. = bin/  src.includes = * src.excludes = src bin.includes = &lt;your own,\     list of,\     files for inclusion,\     in the jar&gt; h3. Check your manifest.mf dependencies A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors is the archives module, which failed to build due to the org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. Inside eclipse and during Juno-based builds, however, the depencency was found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views.  The IDE was able to see that archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.  Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly declared in your manifest.mf</body>

    <body>You can use only one schema for both task and process persistence units. Please remove the database properties from the process persistence unit as the datasource is going to be there. I put those there by mistake. Though it wont make a difference. Change the value of transaction lookup class property hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class from websphere to jboss. You will need to create a datasource in jboss same as the name mentioned in the persistence file. ﻿ These are the changes you need to do. But the error you are getting is because the name of the persistence unit i.e. org.jbpm.persistence.jpa is being used by another project which is also deployed in the same container. So Make these changes and then deploy the archive in another jboss server which has no other projects just to be safe. Regards.</body>

The idea is to have a HTTP update location for my web-app (using apache, or jboss-webdav), and N jboss containers looking up for updates on the war.

    <body>JBoss does not explicitly support this notion. The fact is is that Spring Framework read-only transactions are poorly understood by developers that use it and it rarely does what you expect.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JBoss AS 7 Support for XDoclet tag @jboss.method-attributes needed</header>
    <body>Hello, we are migrating from JBoss AS 4.0.5 to JBoss AS 7.1.3. We have a CMP Entity Bean (EJB 2.1) with a 1:n/n:1 relation (java.util.Set&lt;ObjectXYZ&gt;). When we load the Entity outside of a transaction (for example by calling homeInterface.findByPrimaryKey(4711) and want to iterate over the relation "java.util.Set..." for example from a struts action we get the following Exception in JBoss AS 7. "A CMR collection may only be used within the transaction in which it was created". The Entity ist configured via XDoclet annotations/tags. So we have the tag @jboss.method-attributes pattern = "get*" read-only = "true", which results to &lt;entity&gt;          &lt;ejb-name&gt;....&lt;/ejb-name&gt;          &lt;configuration-name&gt;CMP 2.x and Cache&lt;/configuration-name&gt;         &lt;method-attributes&gt;             &lt;method&gt;               &lt;method-name&gt;get*&lt;/method-name&gt;               &lt;read-only&gt;true&lt;/read-only&gt;             &lt;/method&gt;         &lt;/method-attributes&gt;       &lt;/entity&gt; in jboss.xml. In JBoss 7 AS the jboss.xml is not supported. 1. Question: How can I tell the getter-methods of my entity to be read-only in JBoss AS 7 ? Otherwise I will get the above Exception with the relation ! 2. Querstion: How is it possible to deploy/configure/run a CMP Entity Bean (EJB 2.1) with a CMR without a transaction in JBoss AS 7. Thanks. Ersin.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: JBoss AS 7 Support for XDoclet tag @jboss.method-attributes needed</header>
    <body>Hi Ersin, If you load a collection via CMR the method call of 'Collection get....' and the iteration must be in the same transaction. This is in AS4.3 and AS5, maybe in 4.0 it was different  :( Also in AS7 there are several issues with EJB2 and CMP configuration and behavior. Several people are working on that. I hope that we can provide commits in AS7.1 and AS7.2 branch.</body>

    <body>Hi Wolf-Dieter, thank you very much for the quick response. Up to now, I couldn't find a way to configure calls to the getter methods of a CMP Entity Bean (EJB2.1) read-only. I have looked into the schemas for jboss-ejb3.xml and ejb-jar.xml and couldn't find any support for my problem. In JBoss AS 4/5/6 we had the jboss.xml. We don't want to run a load-anything-method with a CMR call in a EJB transaction, because it's just a read, without a write/update operation. I think, there should not be a need for a transaction in this szenario (performance issues). So, we need something like &lt;entity&gt;      ...         &lt;method-attributes&gt;             &lt;method&gt;               &lt;method-name&gt;get*&lt;/method-name&gt;               &lt;read-only&gt;true&lt;/read-only&gt;             &lt;/method&gt;         &lt;/method-attributes&gt; &lt;/entity&gt; Otherwise, we get the following exception, when we access the CMR collection. "A CMR collection may only be used within the transaction in which it was created". Any idea ? Ersin</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JBoss AS7	Securing Passwords</header>
    <body>That's not fool proof. Hardware encryption will make it difficult to copy the store, but since you have to have the password in our config file, someone with access to the system can get those passwords the same way we can.  User prompted password would be alot more secure, however, for reasons in mentallurg's article it's not very practical. Even with that though, it's not fool proof, if someone gains access to the system they dont even need to use the keystore. If they can get permissions to the running process (e.g. become the user running jboss), then they can take a memory dump of the JVM. Using the memory dump you can get the passwords out.</body>

    <body>I agree a better warning is needed. Looks like you contributed most of that, thanks! However, as you yourself mention concealing and relocating passwords provides security value, it's just a very limited value, that only works in combination with other layers of security. I don't think there was really any intention to mislead here. I myself took the "security through obscurity" quote was actually a reference to "security through obscurity is no security at all"  :)</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - A debuggers guide to 'AS7 Internal Architechture Overview'</header>
    <body>*Introduction* Since Brian Stansberry was kind enough to write an article on the AS 7 interal architechture, the aptly named "AS7 Internal Architecture Overview",  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47970 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AS7InternalArchitectureOverview, I thought I'd document my attempts of walking through it in the form of a tounge-in-cheek diary. Hopefully, he'll have time to correct my misunderstandings (as I'm sure there will be plenty). If nothing else, he will at least have proof that at least one person has read through his article. The first part of this article will deal with setting up the debugging environment and stepping through the aquiring of the ServerEnvironment and the initializations of the BootStrapImpl and ServerContainerImpl instances involved. More will follow as I debug along. *Environment* Well, where to start? Since we all know by now that the AS7 is blazingly fast, we'll need a debugger to place some breakpoints so we'll have a chance of seeing what's going on. Grab Eclipse Juno SR1 from  http://eclipse.org/downloads/ http://eclipse.org/downloads/ and JDK 7 from   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. Install the JDK and Eclipse, you might also want to set JAVA_HOME to point at the JDK and set -vm C:\Java\jvm\jdk1.7.0_12\bin\javaw.exe (on Windows) in eclipse.ini. You'll also want JBoss Tools (since you're the 'living on the edge' kind of person, use the nightlies at  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/ http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/). Then we'll need some sources. Grab the source zip from  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as or even better, install git and do a 'git clone git://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as.git'. Since you're in a hurry (and running tests is for CI-systems anyway, right?), build the as with 'build clean install -DskipTests' After the build has completed, start Eclipse and define a new server pointing at that runtime (it's under the build/target dir). Remember to set the startup timeout to a large number (integers are cheap). *The main method* In the beginning was Main.main(String...). And the return was void. And he thought he'd better roll up his sleeves and get to work. Since Brian told us bootstrapping starts at the server module, use the Eclipse "Import existing Maven project"-feature to pull in the jboss-as-server project from the "server" folder in the AS source. In the article we learn that the startup scripts point JBoss Modules to this very module and the Main server class so this is where we'll place our breakpoint and press the server debug  button to boot it up in debug mode. Takeoff! The breakpoint is hit and you can point the source lookup to the jboss-as-server project on your workspace. If you look at the import list of Main, you will notice references to projects and subprojects such as "controller", "process", "version", "logmanager", "modules", "msc" and "stdio". As this tutorial proceed, I might venture further in but for now I'll take the stance that as-subprojects (such as "controller")  are imported and examined when stumbled upon but as-sibling projects (such as modules and threads) are stepped out of in the debugger. Those who can't wait are of course invited to check out the sibling projects also and step into them. The notable exception to the policy will be the MSC (Modular Service Container) which we will open up since, well, that's a large part of the AS. The first thing the main module does is sets up the basic logging and capturing of the standard I/O streams. It also sets up JBoss Modules with the basic information it need to be able to do it's job (apparently access to the stuff in "org.jboss.vfs", the Virtual File System module) is required. The first real "AS"-work is done in determineEnvironment, where we determine the running environment by assembling a ServerEnviroment. You might also want to import the controller project at this point because we will see RunningMode there (although it's just a simple enum that tells if we're running in normal or admin mode). *The running environment* This method takes the parameters to main(String...), the system properties, the system environment and a flag that tells if this is a standalone instance booting. Both the fetching of the system properties and the environment checks for precense of a security manager and runs the call through AccessController.doPrivileged if one is found. In other cases, a straight call is performed. The main job of determineEnvironment is parsing through the arguments, sometimes just printing out usage or version information and exiting or setting various system/env values based in the incoming prameters.  In our case we hit the determineEnvironment with the "-b" "localhost", "--server-config=standalone.xml" and some system properties/env data. The args are looped and "-b, "localhost" is converted added to the system properties as "jboss.bind.address" =&gt; "localhost" and the serverConfig value is set to standalone.xml. A new ProductConfig is created (it's in the version project, import it), it looks for a system env JBOSS_PRODUCT_CONF and if that can't be found returns the path to a product.conf in the AS bin dir. We don't have any of that so we end up with null for all values, on an EAP, apparently the manifest data of the jar in the org.jboss.as.product module is read according to the slot property which was read from the for-us-fictional property file. Equipped with a deeper knowledge of our three null values, we move on. The determineEnvironemt should return a ServerEnvironment and so it does in the last line by throwing all it got into the constructor of said class. The code in the constuctor is longish but fairly easy to step through, essentially what it does is determine host names and various directories (temp, work, deployments etc) to use based on the information passed in. All this is the encapsulated into the ServerEnvironment object. It also places some of these values back into the system properties. At one point it also copies the original system properties and tucks them away, possibly to be restored when the server reloads or something. Anyways, at this point when the object is returned, the boot process has determined everything it needs to know about its running enviroment and can move on. *Bootstrapping the bootstrapping* At the end of the main loop we get an instance of BootstrapImpl and by doing so we also get a ServiceContainerImpl and here the simple part of the tutorial ends ;-) Import the jboss-msc project. BootstrapImpl creates a ServiceContainerImpl which extends a ServiceTargetImpl. A ServiceTargetImpl is a hiearchial construct with a parent, a Map of ServiceListener with assoicated inheritance data and a Set of dependent service names. The ServiceTargetImpl has various methods for adding/removing dependencies and listeners and working with ServiceBuilders. The javadoc says it's a "Abstract base class used for ServiceTargets" but the implementation looks quite concrete (and central) to the MSC. A ServiceListener is an interfaces that can be used for listening for various events in the MSC, such as state transitions, services added, various dependencies becoming available/unavailable etc. The ServiceListener.Inheritance determines if the listener should be inherited to all sub-service-targets, only once or not at all. By using the subTarget() method you can get a new ServiceTargetImpl with the current instance as the parent (the hiearchial part). There is apparently also a batch-version of the method but let's skip it for now. A ServiceName is an unique (complicated, hierarchial) identifier with a String name, a ServiceName parent and a hashcode. But back to the ServiceContainerImpl. In the instance variables we have a 'registry' - a Map of ServiceName -&gt; ServiceRegistrationImpl, 'start'  (more on the ServiceRegistrationImpl later on) - timestamp of start time, 'shutdownInitiated' - timestamp of shutdown started, 'terminateListeners' - a list of TerminateListener instances interested in the shutdown event, 'profileOutput' - ?, 'terminateInfo' - timestamps of a possible shutdown in progress, 'down' - flag telling if container is down, 'executor' - the container thread pool executor, 'name' - the name of the container, 'mBeanServer' - a handle to the MBeanServer, 'objectName' - the MBean name of the container and 'containerMXBean' - a MBean interface implementation for the container, 'SERIAL' - an AtomicInteger used for getting a serial number for the container, 'PROFILE_OUTPUT' - the value of the system property jboss.msc.profile.output (or null), 'executorSeq' - an AtomicInteger used for getting a sequence number for the executor, 'HANDLER' - an exception handler for uncaught exceptions slipping through and 'POLICY' - a Thread pool executor policy. Phew! There are also some nested classes available. The executor is a ContainerExecutor, which extends a ThreadPoolExecutor. When created, it grabs an id from executorSeq and creates a threadSeq sequence for threads. It offers a newThread(Runnable) method that returns an instance of ServiceThread extends Thread after setting the thread name (including the executors id and an incremented sequence number from the threadSeq). ServiceThread is a basic Thread extension that can keep a reference to a ServiceContainerImpl. The ContainerExecutor also uses HANDLER and POLICY defined in the parent class.  LatchListener is a TerminateListener that increases in the constructor and decreases when a termination is observed, essentially keeping a count of running containers. ShutdownHookHolder hold a boolean down flag that says if the container is shutting down (possibly preventing new containers from being registered). It also contains a set of known containers. A cleanup thread is registered with Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook that sets the down to true, iterates over all known containers, attaches a LatchListener (set to the size of known containers) to them and shuts them down. The terminating containers will fire the termination listener and then the thread can just sit and wait until the latch is finshed (all known containers signalled termination). So we are in the constructor of the ServiceContainerImpl (from BootstrapImpl). Well, first the static stuff is called, causing a greeting to be printed out, then field initialization occurs. But then we get ourselves a serialNo (1) and set the name (jboss-as). The ContainerExecutor is initialized. The objectName is intialized (jboss.msc:type=container,name=jboss-as), the mBeanServer is fetched from the ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer and the containerMXBean is registered with the server. The mBeanServer and objectName are stored to the instance variables. We register the container with the static Set in the ShutdownHookHolder, adding the container and a Reaper that will remove the registration. Finally, if the container was registered as a MBean, we add a termination listener that will unregister the container from the MBean server. With the service container initialized, booting can begin.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single sign on issue on session Expiration Jboss 7</header>
    <body>I have several applications deployed on the same jboss instance. I currently have Single Sign On configured using the &lt;sso/&gt; tag. It is possible for a user to navigate from one application to another app (redirect) deployed on the same jboss instance. Currently when the user is authenticated into the first appplication, the SSO cookie is created and a Single sign on entry is created for this cookie in the SingleSignOn valve which works fine. Each application has a timeout period of 60 mins configured via the web.xml. When the user navigates to the second application the user principal is correctly propogated and a new session is created. However an new SSO entry for the second app is not created since the cookie remains the same. Now the issue is that lets say the session for the first application expires, even if the second app's session is still active because the user is accessing the 2nd app, the Single Sign On entry is deleted. Therefore the principal is lost on subsequent requests for the second application. Because the Single Sign entry that is removed also gets rid of the principal. Is there a way to get around this issue?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - [jboss-modules] More public ModuleLoaders</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm currently trying to integrate jboss-modules into Tomcat ( https://github.com/hasalex/tomcat-modules https://github.com/hasalex/tomcat-modules), in replacement of the regular WebappClassLoader. I'm not sure to have a real use-case of that, but I think that it's a nice way to learn jboss-modules. My first steps would be much easier if I had some more public module loaders. For example, I find the ClassPathModuleLoaderWrapper useful but it is package-private. In fact, a lot of stuff are package-private. Jboss-modules would be much more extensible and useful with more public classes.</body>

    <body>Watch A Haunted House Online: After a supporting stint in the little-seen gang drama New Blood 1999 Wayans’ film fortunes increased dramatically when he co-starred with his brother Marlon in a hit film directed by their older brother Keenan: Scary Movie 1999–2000, a comic satire which he also co-wrote on the then-recent trend of horror films like Scream. Wayans played the apparently closeted Ray Wilkins, a role he reprised for the similarly popular 2001 sequel Scary Movie 2. Watch A Haunted House Online Free. Soon after, Ben finds David at home with blood all over his forearms, eyes rolled back into his head, much the way Maria was during the exorcism. The police arrive, and though it doesn’t show on film, David acquires an officer’s handgun and holds it in his mouth. Ben tells him to fight it, but he begins to weep, reciting The Lord’s Prayer, stopping; forgetting the last few words. He laughs and then shoots himself. Just then, Isabella begins having a seizure. Download A Haunted House Movie: From the writing team that brought us LiTTLEMAN 2006 and White Chicks 2002 comes the upcoming film A Haunted House, the latest spoof film to skewer modern horror movie tropes. Today saw its first official trailer hit the web. Marlon Wayans, lead actor, co-writer and producer of the film, was responsible for launching the Scary Movie franchise back in the early aughts. Watch A Haunted House Online Though this new feature may seem like a bit of a retread, this time Wayans has a whole new slew of found-footage horror films to lampoon-from The Devil Inside to Paranormal Activity 2007 to those ridiculous ghost-chasing TV shows you always see advertised-it’s all ripe for parody in this new trailer. One thing that is a little troubling about the trailer is the inclusion of Nick Swardson as a seemingly prominent character. Anyone who remembers last year’s ill-fated television show of his Pretend Time…or the awful Adam Sandler movie he had a role in Just Go with It….or the other awful. Watch a haunted house Movie: Where do jokes go to die? A HAUNTED HOUSE. No, that wasn't my own botched attempt at a joke, it's just a fact; this parody movie wouldn't know a clever joke, pun or sight gag if it happened upon one by accident. The brainchild of Marlon Wayans, who has tried his hand at goofing on horror movies before with the first two SCARY MOVIE flicks, this cheap and dull product is like a consistent assault on your patience and, eventually, your will to live. A HAUNTED HOUSE's supposed goal is to thoroughly skewer the found footage genre, mostly the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films, with a side of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and THE DEVIL INSIDE. (That's the extent of Wayans and his co-writer Rick Alvarez's found footage knowledge.) However, as the movie is mainly a series of fart, genital, race and gender jokes, it's obvious that it doesn't have anything subversive or intelligent to say about the genre itself - it's just inserting a lot of crude idiocy.</body>

I thought it is not exposed, so I tried to expose it by adding the following to the startup script (like I do for the community hornetq): -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=127.0.0.1 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3900 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false This fails on: WARNING: Failed to load the specified log manager class org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at org.jboss.as.server.Main.main(Main.java:73) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597) at org.jboss.modules.Module.run(Module.java:260) at org.jboss.modules.Main.main(Main.java:291) Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: The LogManager was not properly installed (you must set the "java.util.logging.manager" system property to "org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager") at org.jboss.logmanager.Logger.getLogger(Logger.java:60) at org.jboss.logmanager.log4j.BridgeRepositorySelector.&lt;clinit&gt;(BridgeRepositorySelector.java:42) ... 7 more</body>

    <body>I added this and one change I notice is when apache is restarted, jboss also drops all 8009 connections which was not happening earlier. However on apache, all the established connections get into closed_wait state and never released. This forces apache to be restarted often. Do we have a permanent fix for this from jboss.</body>

    <body>Thanks a ton. This solves our issue. I think there are few other discussions in jboss forum on this issue . I think this one should get into ajp documentation. Usually Apache and jboss sits in between firewalls and the probability of hitting this issue is high. Thank you once again for your response</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss ESB Development] - Loading Spring annotated beans from AbstractSpringAction in ESB ActionPipeline</header>
    <body>Hi,          I have an issue loading Spring 3 Beans annotated with Stereotypes- @Component, at Repository, at Service.         My current *applicationContext.xml* defined within the project has ComponentScanning enabled for a package using -         &lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;         &lt;context:component-scan base-package="classpath*:net.whatever.service"/&gt;         I'm using the JBoss ESB 4.11 Server. Here I have a ServicePipeline which takes in an Action with an ActionClass extending the AbstractSpringAction that loads the SpringContext. Here's how I'm doing this -          &lt;service category="category" name="servicename"&gt;          &lt;listeners&gt;          &lt;jms-listener busidref="defined" name="listenername" /&gt;          &lt;/listeners&gt;           &lt;actions mep="OneWay"&gt;           &lt;action name="actionname" class="net.whatever.custom.MySpringEnabledAction" process="processname"&gt;               &lt;property name="springContextXml" value="applicationContext.xml"/&gt;               &lt;action ... /&gt;            &lt;/actions&gt;           &lt;/service&gt;         Here's a piece of code of how I'm implementing the MySpringEnabledAction.java class -                     public processName ....                            ..... The problem I'm facing is with this now - In the package *net.whatever.service* on which Spring does the ComponentScanning there is a class called MyServiceImpl.java which looks like this -              @Service(name="myservice_name")                  ....                  .... MyService is an interface and there is no ambiguity between beans. This is the only Concrete implementation which implements this interface. This annotation is not being seen or not being detected because this Bean is not being Pre-initialized by the Spring Container.. as a result I keep getting an error of org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of type [net.whatever.service.MyService]... This error pops-up because there is another Bean which is trying to use @Autowired annotation and injecting the MyService Bean into its implementation. This other bean looks like this -                                   protected MyService myservice                                 @Autowired                                .....                                ..... This bean is also loaded by Spring but the difference here is its not part of the ComponentScanning that Spring will use.. it has a bean definition as XML configuration within the applicationContext.xml. All the Spring configuration worked fine when I deployed it as a WAR and used the Servlet context to load the Spring Context.. but now with this ESB Action loading the SpringContext.. all the basic annotations are falling apart. So could somebody help me figure out what the issue with the SpringContainer not pre-initializing the MyService Bean is? Thanks.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - AS 7 Internal	Architecture Overview</header>
    <body>h2. High Level Overview At a coarse level, AS 7 consists of two main elements: * A core manageable service container based on modular classloading * Extensions to that core that provide the kind of functionality most users associate with an application server, like handling HTTP requests and managing transactions The AS distribution also includes two clients for the management interfaces it exposes (a CLI tool and a web-based admin console). The AS codebase also produces implementations of the SPIs published by the Arquillian project, allowing AS7 servers to run Arquillian-based tests. h3. AS Core The core of the AS consists of the following primary elements: * A modular classloading system provided by the jboss-modules library * A fast, highly scalable service container framework provided by the jboss-msc library * An extensible management layer that is meant to mediate access to the service container by logic that wants to add, remove and modify services. The management layer also provides a consistent, persistent, configuration model for the AS. The management layer involves* core elements, via the jboss-dmr library and the AS's own controller, controller-client, deployment-repository, domain-management and network modules as well as parts of the server module * remote management capability via the protocol and domain-http modules * multi-server managed domains via the process-controller and host-controller modules * miscellaneous elements provided via the managment-client-content and platform-mbean modules * A deployment framework for coordinating installation of deployment content into the runtime. This is one of the things provided by the server module. h3. AS Extensions Most of the functionality that end users associate with an application server is provided AS extensions. Most of the modules in the AS7 codebase are extension implementations, with each extension providing a coherent set of functionality. Many extensions provide support for some aspect of the Java EE specifications. Extensions implement an interface (org.jboss.as.controller.Extension) that allows integration with the core AS management layer. Via that mechanism, extensions are able to * participate in the parsing and marshalling of the AS's configuration documents * register resources and operations to be exposed via the AS's management API * install services into the AS's service container * register deployment unit processors with the AS's deployment framework See the " https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Extending+JBoss+AS+7 Extending JBoss AS 7" document for more on extensions. See also  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 for more on how extending AS 7 differs from extending previous version of JBoss AS. h2. AS7 Boot Process To better illustrate the AS 7 architecture, let's walk through the boot process for a standalone server. h3. Primordial Boot When you run bin/standalone.sh from the root of the AS 7 distribution, the final effect is to launch a JVM using the following essential command java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.standalone If you start the AS and use the ps command to see the actual JVM launch command, you'll see a lot of JVM settings (-Xmx and the like) and a lot of system property settings, but the above bits are the key information. Let's break that down a bit: java -jar jboss-modules.jar We can see from this that the actual main class the VM will invoke isn't in a JBoss AS library at all; it's in jboss-modules.jar (the org.jboss.modules.Main class.) So, when you start the AS the first thing you are doing is setting up a modular classloading environment. -mp modules These are argument passed to org.jboss.modules.Main.main(). The -mp is short for "module path" and the value is a path analogous to the value of an OS $PATH environment variable. Each item in the path is a location under which jboss-modules will look for a module when needed. If there is more than one item in the path, the items are searched in order, with the search ending as soon as the module is found. In this case there is only one item in the path -- the modules/ dir under the AS distribution root. org.jboss.as.standalone This is the name of a module located on the module path. This module will be loaded by jboss-modules. If you look in the modules/org/jboss/as/standalone/module.xml file in the AS distribution, you will see it includes this element: &lt;main-class name="org.jboss.as.server.Main"/&gt; When jboss-modules sees that element in the module.xml for the module passed to its main() method, it knows to load the specified class and to pass any remaining command line arguments into +its+ main() method. So, now we have a modular classloading enviroment set up, and the org.jboss.as.server.Main.main() method (found in the AS codebase's server module) has been invoked. The org.jboss.as.server.Main.main() method does a number of things, but two are most relevant for people who wish to understand how to develop the AS: * Any remaining command line arguments are processed and an instance of the ServerEnvironment is created. This object encapsulates environmental information available via the command line or system properties; things like where the root of the AS dist is; where the root of the server instance is; where the configuration file is, etc. Later this information is made available to all services in the system via the ServerEnvironmentService. * An object implementing the Bootstrap interface (specifically, the org.jboss.as.server.BootstrapImpl class) is created  and configured and its bootstrap() method is invoked. h3. Service-based Boot The most important thing BootstrapImpl does is create an instance of the JBoss MSC library's ServiceContainer interface. A service container manages a set of running services. A service is simply a thing that can be started and stopped, with start and stop performed via methods specified in the JBoss MSC Service interface. A service also exposes a value of some type T via the Service interface's public T getValue() method. The value type T specified by the service is used by default by consumers of the service, and should represent the public interface of the service, which may or may not be the same as the implementing type of the service. The ServiceContainer provides an API for managing services -- configuring and installing them, removing them, triggering start and stop, looking up already installed services, etc. Configuring a service can involve expressing the dependencies the service has on other services and asking that the service container inject the value of depended-upon services into the service before starting it. If a service depends upon another service, that other service must be successfully started before the service container will invoke the dependent service's start method. If for some reason the depended-upon service needs to be stopped, the service container will invoke the dependent service's stop method first. The ServiceContainer maintains an internal thread pool. In order to achieve highly performant management of large numbers of inter-related services, activities related to starting and stopping services are performed as a series of concisely scoped tasks, with the threads in the thread pool used to execute those tasks. For example, executing a service's start method would be a task performed by a thread in the ServiceContainer's thread pool. Because of this fact, +it is important to recognize that any activity related to starting and stopping services will be highly multi-threaded. For example, you can never assume that the thread that asks the service container to install a service will be the thread that calls its start method.+ So, at this point in our boot, we have in place two of the four main architectural elements discussed in the "AS Core" section above: a modular classloading environment provided by the jboss-modules library, and a service container framework provided by the jboss-msc library.  + + Up to this point in theS boot, all activity has been on a single thread, the JVM's main thread. In the BootstrapImpl.bootstrap() method, things get more interesting, since much of the remaining boot work involves installing services, with the ServiceContainer's thread pool threads doing the most of that work. BootstrapImpl.bootstrap() installs two services: * ControlledProcessStateService. This service provides access to a simple enum value showing the current running state of the server (STARTING, STOPPING, RUNNING, RESTART_REQUIRED, RELOAD_REQUIRED). This is the only service that once started should not be stopped until the VM is being shut down. * ApplicationServerService. This is the root service for the application server; all other services in one way or another depend upon it. When you use the CLI to perform the :reload operation, the server handles that request by telling the service container to stop this service, which has the effect of stopping all other services that depend upon it. Then once it is stopped, the service container is told to start the service again. The A starts a number of other services in its start method. The most significant of these is the ServerService. h3. The ServerService and the Controller Boot Thread ServerService brings in the 3rd and 4th of the four primary components of the core AS listed in the "High Level Overview" above -- the extensible management layer and the deployment framework. For those of you familiar with the " https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS72/Extending+JBoss+AS+7 Extending JBoss AS 7" document, ServerService performs many of the same kinds of activities an Extension implementation performs in its initialize(ExtensionContext context) method, but for the core AS management model: * registers resource definitions, attributes definitions and OperationStepHandlers for the core AS managed resources * registers core DeploymentUnitProcessors ServerService implements Service&lt;ModelController&gt;. A ModelController is the central execution point for management operations in a managed AS process (i.e. a server or a HostController in a managed domain.) In its start method, ServerService spawns a separate thread, the "Controller Boot Thread", which is responsible for the coordinating the remainder of the boot. It does the following primary tasks ** Triggers the parsing of the server configuration file (e.g. standalone.xml) into a list of management operations that should be executed by the ModelController to bring the server's running configuration in line with the xml configuration ** Passes those management operations into the ModelController's execute method. The ModelController uses the Controller Boot Thread to handle execution of many of the steps involved in handling those operations. ** Blocks until all services added into the runtime as part of of handling those management ops have either started or failed to start. ** Logs the completion of boot. The tasks of the Controller Boot Thread are spelled out in some further detail below. h4. XML Parsing, Extension Loading, Extension Parsing Initialization The task of an XML parser for an AS7 configuration document (e.g. standalone.xml, domain.xml, host.xml) is to populate a list of management operations that should be executed by the ModelController to bring the server's running configuration in line with the xml. Each of those management operations has the same format as would be read off the wire if the CLI had sent an operation request to the server to invoke an equivalent operation. The parser for the core AS xml namespace has some special behavior when it comes to parsing an &lt;extension&gt; element in the xml: * The name attribute of the element is the name of a JBoss Modules module that contains an implementation of the org.jboss.as.controller.Extension interface * Once the name is parsed, the parser asks JBoss Modules to load the module * Once the module is loaded, the java.lang.ServiceLoader mechanism is used to load the module's implementation of the Extension interface. * The initializeParsers(ExtensionParsingContext context) on that Extension implementation is invoked. That allows the extension to register XML parsers for the XML namespaces supported by the subsystems the extension provides. * When the core AS xml parser subsequently encounters a &lt;subsystem&gt; element in the configuration document, the xml namespace of the element is determined, and the appropriate parser registered by some Extension is used to parse that portion of the document. h4. Execution of Boot Management Operations, Extension Initialization Once xml parsing is complete, a list of management operations is ready for execution by the ModelController. Each operation has the same format (address, operation name, parameters) as would be read off the wire if the CLI had sent an operation request to the server to invoke an equivalent operation. The Controller Boot Thread asks the ModelController to execute the operations as a unit, with each individual operation acting as a step in the overall unit of work. Execution process in 3 stages, with all steps in the overall unit completing a stage before execution on the next stage begins. (This execution pattern applies whenever any operation or atomic list of operations is invoked, not just during boot.) * Stage MODEL -- the OperationStepHandler registered for each operation makes necessary updates to the server's internal configuration model, and, if necessary, registers a handler for the same operation for Stage RUNTIME. * Stage RUNTIME -- any OperationStepHandler registered in Stage MODEL for an operation accesses the JBoss MSC ServiceContainer and installs/removes/updates any relevant services. The ServiceContainer has its own thread pool and uses it to perform the necessary tasks to start and stop services. The thread executing the OperationStepHandler does not do this directly, and the handler implementation needs to recognize that service start/stop will be asynchronous. * Stage VERIFY -- A Stage.MODEL or Stage.RUNTIME handler can register a Stage.VERIFY handler that will only run once the ServiceContainer had completed all service modifications made in stage RUNTIME. A VERIFY handler can check that the runtime services completed successfully. Before the list of boot operations is passed into the ModelController, a check for operations that add extension resources (e.g. using CLI syntax, /extension=org.foo.extension:add) is done. When one is found, the relevant Extension implementation's initialize(ExtensionContext context) method is invoked. This gives the Extension a chance to register its resource and attribute definitions and OperationStepHandlers with the core AS management layer before the boot operations are executed. h4. Wait for Service Container Stability and Boot Completion The final steps in the AS 7 boot are to wait while the JBoss MSC ServiceContainer processes the installation and start of all the services added by the handlers for the boot operations. As discussed in the introduction to the ServiceContainer above, the start of services is performed by threads in the ServiceContainer's internal thread pool. Services are not started by the Controller Boot Thread. However, the ServerService attaches a listener to the controller object for each service; using this the ServerService is able to track when all services have reached a stable state. The Controller Boot Thread uses this facility to block until the ServiceContainer has stabilized. At that point, all services are either started or failed, and boot is nearly complete. The Controller Boot Thread switches the state of the ControlledProcessState service from STARTING to RUNNING, write a log message reporting that the boot is complete, and boot is finished. h2. Deployment Processing When you trigger deployment of some content, one of the management operations supported by the core AS management layer is invoked. The logic responsible for handling that operation will extract relevant information from the operation request (e.g. the name of the deployment) and will then install services into the AS's service container: * A Service&lt;VirtualFile&gt; implementation that provides an org.jboss.vfs.VirtualFile that represents the deployment content. * A Service&lt;DeploymentUnit&gt; (in this case RootDeploymentUnitService) that provides a DeploymentUnit for the deployment. A DeploymentUnit retains data which is persistent for the life of the deployment, and is the object that will later be passed into the various DeploymentUnitProcessor implementations that perform various actions to install the runtime services needed by the deployment. The RootDeploymentUnitService has injected into it a reference to all the DeploymentUnitProcessor (DUP) implementations that were registered by the core ServerService at boot or that have been registered by subsystems. The DUP implementations are grouped by the Phase of the deployment process in which they execute, and are numerically ordered within that phase. Deployment proceeds in phases. See the  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/server/deployment/Phase.java Phase enum for a listing of the phases. For each phase, there is a DeploymentUnitPhaseService representing that phase that is installed into the service container. Each phase service (save the first) depends on the phase service for the previous phase, and each phase service (save the last) in its start method installs the phase service for the next phase. The RootDeploymentUnitService in its start method installs the first phase service, which in turn depends on it the RootDeploymentUnitService. The effect of all this is if the RootDeploymentUnitService is stopped (e.g. by the undeploy management operation), this will trigger a requirement for the service container to first stop the first phase service, which will in turn trigger a requirement to first stop the next phase service, and so on all the way to the final phase service. The effect is the phase services will be stopped in reverse order from how they were started. The primary thing the phase services do in their start and stop methods is invoke the deploy and undeploy methods of each DeploymentUnitProcessor registered for their phase. The deploy method is invoked in phase service start and the undeploy method is invoked in stop. For each deploy/undeploy call the DUP is provided with a DeploymentPhaseContext that provides context to the call and gives the DUP access to the service container, allowing it to install or remove services.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Layered Distributions and Module Path Organization</header>
    <body>h1. +*This proposal is slightly WIP*+ h1. Overview This document describes notions for how different software distributions based on the JBoss AS 7 project can integrate with the base AS and with each other in a controlled manner. +* *+ h1. Fundamental Concepts h2. Distribution A coherent set of software produced by a "project" or a "product". JBoss AS 7 is a project. JBoss EAP is such a product. Both play similar technical roles in the JBoss ecosystem, but there are significant differences in how the two are made available to end users. This article uses "distribution" as a replacement for constantly saying "project/product" everywhere. It's not a great term; if someone has a better one, please suggest it. h2. Distribution Base The "distribution base" is the core set of modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that is common to all layered distributions. It may itself be usable standalone project or product. Currently the software produced by the JBoss AS 7 project and the JBoss EAP product are the distribution bases relevant to this discussion. In the future a more limited subset of functionality may become the distribution base, with the full set of functionality currently provided in community AS and EAP coming as layered distributions or add-ons. h2. Layered Distribution A distribution that builds on top of the distribution base, potentially superceding some of the distribution base's functionality. A layered distribution is allowed to supercede any aspect of the distribution base's functionality. The less the layered distribution does this, the easier it will be for the layered distribution to manage things like patching, but, if necessary, a layered distribution can supercede anything in the distribution base. A layered distribution build on top of another layered distribution, provided it has worked out the necessary procedures to ensure compatibility. h2. Identity An identity is a named set of distribution base + layered distribution(s) that is certified as a valid combination. The distribution base by itself may or may not be a valid identity. Currently it is; in the future it may not be. The software produced by a given layered distribution may be associated with more than one identity. h3. Patching and Identities Patches are applicable to an identity. A given patch can apply to more than one identity, if there are no conflicts between the identities in terms of how they use the items modified by a patch. The metadata associated with a patch will indicate the identities to which it is applicable. Patches are comprised of one or more discrete +patch elements+ each of which is produced by the distribution base or by one of the layered distributions associated with the identity. A patch element includes metadata describing the element along with any added or modified files. The patch element metadata will identify the provider of the patch component. A given patch element can be used in multiple different patches. For example, a patch element upgrading the distribution base can be included in several patches produced by different identities, with each patch also including a patch element upgrading a layered distribution used in that identity. For example, let's say an identity named A consists of the distribution base and a layered distribution named A. Version 1.0 of identity A is based on version 2.0 of the distribution base and version 1.0 of layered distribution A. The distribution base produces a patch element that will move it to version 2.1. The producers of the A identity could then produce a patch that will result in version 1.1 of identity A. This would include a patch element upgrading layered distribution A to its version 1.1, as well as the separate element that provides the distribution base upgrade to its 2.1. There are two main benefits of this sharing approach: * The modules and bundles provided by the distribution base upgrade are associated with the original 2.1 patch provided by the distribution base, not just with the enclosing patch provided by A. This will make possible the sharing of modules/bundles provided by patches across installations. * Incorporating one patch within another as a simple discrete unit helps avoid errors during patch production. For modules and bundles within a patch, once the patch is applied the association of the module or bundle with the distribution base or layer that provided it is retained within the installation. The association is encoded within the filesystem path that points to the patch version of the module or bundle. Miscellaneous files within a patch are not associated with the distribution base or any particular layered distribution once they are installed. For example bin/standalone.sh is bin/standalone.sh no matter what patch component added or modified it. Each identity produces a patch stream. Because a given patch can apply to more than one identity, the same patch can appear in multiple patch streams. The distribution base and layered distributions can produces +patch elements+ but they cannot themselves produce +patches+ or a patch stream. Since a patch must be associated with an an identity, only an identity (or a group of cooperating identities) can produce a patch. If there is an identity that consists of nothing but the distribution base, that identity can produce a patch. But this is logically not the same thing as saying the distribution base itself produced the patch, even though the practical effect is similar. h2. Installation An installation is a single filesystem location containing the distribution base plus zero or more layered distributions. It includes the bin/ dir from which processes are launched. The root of the installation is the path indicated by the $JBOSS_HOME environment variable referred to in the scripts and indicated by the jboss.home.dir system property used in the java code. h3. Installation Identity Each installation has a *+single identity+*. Because an installation only has a single identity, there is no confusion as to which layered distribution "owns" a particular filesystem location in that installation. Further, because the identity of an installation can be easily determined (see "Establishing Identity" below), external tools can quickly understand the functionality provided by a given installation, even if no process is currently running from the installation. +TODO further spell out the importance of single identity.+ h3. Sharing Files Across Installations+ + The files that comprise modules and bundles are potentially sharable across installations. Making it easy for users to do this should be a key goal. Miscellaneous files are not sharable across installations. An end user could potentially share them using symlinks, but doing so is not a supported feature nor is it a recommended practice. Patches are not sharable across installations. The +modules and bundles that the patch provides+ are potentially sharable, but the miscellaneous files provided by a patch are not sharable. The patching history metadata that the patching tool records in the installation is also not sharable -- the metadata is associated with the given installation. However, making it easy to share the the modules and bundles provide by a patch across installations should be a key goal. h2. Add-On Distribution An add-on distribution is a set of software that extends the capabilities of a given "identity". An add-on can only extend capabilities. It is not allowed to supercede capabilities of the identity it extends. For modules and OSGi bundles, the module and bundle loading logic provided by the distribution base will enforce this behavior. For miscellaneous files, it is up to the people providing an add-on to ensure that the add-on does not overwrite any file provided by the distribution base, any layered distribution associated with the identity or any other add-ons associated with the identity. Conversely, once the providers of an identity have accepted an add-on into their ecosystem, it is their responsibility to ensure that they do not add any files to their distributions that will conflict with files already provided by the add-on. In practice, the most likely sources of conflict will be the xml files in the configuration directories and the .conf files in the bin directory. Conflicts over xml files are solvable by having add-on providers ship their own xml file variants rather than attempting to modify the standard ones that ship with the identity. A given add-on is allowed to extend the capabilities of more than one identity. An add-on may require the presence of other add-ons. h3. Patching and Add-ons Add-on distributions produce their own patch stream. The patches produced by an add-on indicate the versions of the identity that must be present for the patch to apply. More than one identity can be listed, since add-ons may be applicable to multiple identities. The patches produced by an add-on also indicate the existing version of the add-on that must be present, as well as the version of any other required add-ons. Add-ons cannot use patches in their own stream to fix problems in the identity on which they depend. Add-ons depend on the patch stream provided by their dependent identity to provide such fixes. Modules and bundles provided by an add-on or its patches will have lower precedence in the module loading order than those that come from the distribution base or layered distributions, so any fix to such a module/bundle provided by an add-on patch will have no effect. h1. Installers +TODO discussion of RPM+ h2. Distribution Base Installers The distribution base can be installed via a simple unzip. If the distribution base is itself an identity, see also "Identity Installers" h2. Identity Installers An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that already contains a depended upon identity or the installation base of a zip that only includes the layered distribution(s) to be added. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an identity is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is irrevocably changed.+* When an identity is installed it has the right to modify any miscellaneous files in the installation filesystem, so once an identity is installed, the identity of the installation is changed. In many (hopefully nearly all) cases it may be possible for a user to remove files added by an identity install and get the installation back to its previous identity, but doing this is not a supported feature of the software and is not a recommended practice. *+However, once support for installing patches via the patching tool is available, reverting an identity installation will be possible.+* The patching tool maintains backup copies of any miscellaneous files modified by a patch, making it possible to restore those files. h2. Add-on Installer An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions along with the add-on itself. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that contains the depended upon identity of a zip that only includes the add-on. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an add-on is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is not changed, and it must be possible to reverse the installation.+* An add-on is merely additive, so removing it is a matter of deleting what was added. This could be done via a script provided by the add-on, via an installer program, or manually by a user following a set of instructions. h1. Establishing Identity It +must+ be possible for external tools to determine the identity of a given installation without requiring the software based on that installation to be running. It's also necessary for the software based on an installation to determine its own identity. This will be done via the bin/product.conf file located in the distribution. This file will include: * The name of the identity * The name of any layered distributions used by the identity, in order of the precedence to be used when loading their modules. If no bin/product.conf file exists, the installation is assumed to be the community version of the distribution base. If no layered distributions are named in the file, only the base and any add-ons will be used. h1. Module Loading JBoss AS currently loads modules based on a "module path" which is a list of filesystem locations which JBoss Modules searches for modules. In our standard launch scripts, users are able to manipulate this module path by setting the $JBOSS_MODULEPATH environment variable. If not set, $JBOSS_MODULEPATH is set to $JBOSS_HOME/modules. This mechanism creates a single default location under which modules can be located. This is problematic when layered distributions and add-ons wish to install their own modules, since there are no clear rules as to how those modules should be installed or how they relate to one another. h2. Goals * To make it easy for layered distributions or add-ons to add their modules to the set of available modules or remove their modules from the set of available modules, without fear of physically overwriting modules provided by others. * To establish clear rights and responsibilities for providers of the distribution base, layered distributions and add-ons with respect to how their modules should be managed. * To establish clear rules for how distributions that add modules that must take precedence over other modules provided by other distributions with the same name and slot should:* locate those modules * indicate at launch time to the modular classloading system the precedence order * To make it easy for end users to alter the module path for their own purposes by setting $JBOSS_MODULEPATH without needing to concern themselves with details of how the modules provided by the distribtuion base, layered distributions, or add-ons relate to one another. Reserve the use of $JBOSS_MODULEPATH and the value of the -mp command line argument passed to jboss-modules for end use uses. h2. Rights and Responsibilities of Module Providers All modules provided as part of the distribution base can be depended upon by any add-on associated with an identity. If the distribution base by itself is an identity (i.e. with no additional layered distribution required), the providers of the distribution base accept the following with respect to that identity: * The version of the module the distribution base provides will take precedence over a module with the same name and slot provided by any add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch will need to be tested for compatibility with add-ons based on the version of the identity being patched. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the distribution base cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the distribution base itself no longer needs that module. If the distribution base is part of an identity along with one or more layered distributions, the providers of the distribution base accept the following with respect to that identity: * The distribution base has the same responsibilities with respect to add-ons that it has in the case of add-ons without any layered distribution. * However, if a layered distribution in an identity provides a module with the same name and slot as the one provided by the distribution base, the distribution base no longer has responsibility to provide the module. The layered distribution's version of the module takes precedence. * The distribution base can modify a module that is depended upon by a layered distribution in a way that breaks functionality of the layered distribution. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the distribution base before making them available for use with the identity. If the distribution base patch element in some way breaks the functionality of an identity, either the patch element should not be provided for the identity, or the patch that incorporates the distribution base patch element should also include a layered distribution patch element that fixes the problem.* However, the distribution base should take great care not to break layered distributions with which it is associated when it produces patch elements. Distribution base patch element production should involve reasonable testing of all relevant identities such that problems can be found and resolved before the distribution base patch element ships. * The distribution base can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on but which is depended upon by a layered distribution. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the distribution base before making them available for use with the identity. If the distribution base removes a module depended upon by a layered distribution, the patch that incorporates the distribution base patch element should also include a layered distribution patch element that adds the module as part of the layered distribution. * If an identity add-on depends on a module provided by the distribution base and the distribution base wishes to remove the module, that is allowed provided some layered distribution is willing to begin providing the same module in an overall patch. All modules provided as part of a layered distribution can be depended upon by any add-on associated with an identity. They cannot be depended upon by the distribution base. When a layered distribution includes a module it accepts the following: * The version of the module it provides will take precedence over a module with the same name and slot provided by the distribution base or by any add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch element will need to be tested for compatibility with add-ons based on that version of the identity. Any functionality provided by the distribution base and supported by the identity will also have to be tested. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the layered distribution cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the layered distribution itself no longer needs that module. * A layered distribution can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on. If a layered distribution participates in an identity with another layered distribution that depends on it, the depended-on layer accepts the following: * If the dependent layered distribution provides a module with the same name and slot as the one provided by the depended-on layer, the depended-on layer no longer has responsibility to provide the module to the dependent or to any add-ons. The dependent layered distribution's version of the module takes precedence. * The depended-on layer can modify a module that is depended upon by another layer in a way that breaks functionality of the dependent. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the component layers before making them available for use with the identity. If the depended-on layer's patch element in some way breaks the functionality of an identity, either the patch should not be provided for the identity, or the patch element that incorporates the depended-on layer's patch component should also include a patch element to a dependent layer that fixes the problem.* However, a depended-on layer should take great care not to break dependent layers when it produces patch elements. Layered distribution patch production should involve reasonable testing of all relevant identities such that problems can be found and resolved before the depended-on layer's patch ships. * A depended-on layer can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on but which is depended upon by another layer. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by a depended-upon layered distribution before making them available for use with the identity. If the depended-upon layer removes a module that is depended upon by another layer, the patch that incorporates the depended-upon layer's patch element should also include a patch element from the dependent layer distribution that adds the module as part of that layered distribution. * If an add-on depends on a module provided by the layered distribution and the layered distribution wishes to remove the module, that is allowed provided some other layered distribution in the identity is willing to begin providing the same module in an overall patch. When an add-on includes a module, it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the add-on is associated: * The distribution base or a layered distribution may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the module provided by the add-on. * Another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * Another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of the depended-upon module in a patch element will need to be tested for compatibility with any add-on based on the same major version of the identity.* The providers of the add-on are responsible for providing an adequate set of tests to the providers of the identity. * The distribution base or a layered distribution cannot depend upon a module provided by an add-on. * As a consequence of the previous point, an add-on can remove a module in a patch, without fear of breaking the core functionality of an identity. * An add-on can depend up a shareable module provided by another add-on upon which it depends, but +only with the express consent of the providers of that add-on+. Such dependencies are strongly discouraged. * If an add-on allows another add-on to depend upon its modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons. Testing procedures must be created to ensure that any patches produced by the depended-upon add-on do not break the dependent add-on. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the add-on cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another add-on, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module. h2. Module Organization on the Filesystem This section will describe how the above points are reflected in the actual organization of modules on the filesystem. h4. Requirement for Standardized Module Loading JBoss Modules can support other mechanisms for finding module content and loading it besides the filesystem-based module path mechanism. Theoretically a custom boot module loader implementation could be specified at process launch, with that module loader using some other means for locating module content. This article proposes that this capability be declared as unsupported for JBoss AS and products based upon it. Rather, the AS will have a specified boot module loader implementation. Users of the AS community project are free to use a non-standard boot module loader implementation, but if they do so and certain features provided by the AS don't work, that is their problem. h3. Filesystem Layout Modules would be organized on the filesystem as follows: modules + internal ++ add-ons +++ abc +++ def ++ layers +++ base +++ vuw +++ xyz The internal level exists to separate modules associated with the distribution base, layered distribution or add-ons from those the end user may store in the modules directory. +TODO Some better name for internal would be nice.+ h3. Translation of Filesystem Layout into Module Loading Precedence For any location provided by the user via the -mp switch, the module loader will look for the internal structure. If it is found in more than one location, an exception will be thrown. The module loader will understand the structure above and will apply module loading precedence rules as follows. Assume the above structure exists under $JBOSS_HOME and that the user sets $JBOSS_MODULEPATH as follows JBOSS_MODULESPATH=/user/me/my-modules;$JBOSS_HOME/modules In addition, the bin/product.conf file declares that the identity of the install is xyz, the xyz layered distribution should be loaded and the xyz layered distribution depends on the vuw layered distribution. Assume also that patches named base-1, abc-1, def-1, vuw-1, xyz-1 and xyz-2 have been applied. The module loader would look for modules on the filesystem in following locations, starting with first and terminating as soon as the module is found: /user/me/my-modules /modules (in case the user placed modules directly in under this directory) /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-1 /modules/layers/xyz /modules/layers/vuw/patches/vuw-1 /modules/layers/vuw /modules/layers/base/patches/base-1 /modules/layers/base /modules/add-ons/abc/patches/abc-1 /modules/add-ons/abc /modules/add-ons/def/patches/def-1 /modules/add-ons/def The precedence order between /modules/add-ons/abc and /modules/add-ons/def is arbitrary. An add-on should never assume its modules will take precedence over those of any other add-on's modules. The fact that the various patches locations are included in the path is entirely due to +metadata+ that the patching tool will store in the $JBOSS_HOME/patches directory. The mere presence of a directory like /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 is insufficient to trigger inclusion of that directory in the module search path. However, when the patching tool installs the patch, the actual location of the +module contents+ will be in /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 -- only patching related metadata will be stored in $JBOSS_HOME/patches. This behavior is important for allowing sharing of modules across installations. h2. Sharing Modules Across Installations The above behavior makes it relatively straightforward for a user to share modules across installations. For example, the user could set up a shared module repo in /user/me with the following structure jboss-module-repo + add-ons ++ abc ++ def + layers ++ base ++ vuw ++ xyz The $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal location in each installation on the filesystem could then be replaced with a symlink to /user/me/jboss-module-repo. The downside to this very simple sharing is the abc and def add-ons will be visible and used by all installations, whether or not they are relevant to the installation's identity. A solution to this problem would be to do more symlinks: $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/layers -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/layers $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/add-ons/abc -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/abc $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal/add-ons/def -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/def As an improvement at some point we could define some sort of file format (say xml) and allow a file with that format to be placed in $JBOSS_HOME/modules/internal in lieu of the subdirectories. The file would include all of the mapping information for the external repo. The boot module loader, patching tool and any programmatic installers would know how to read and update that file. The file would only include information for the add-ons relevant to the installation. h3. Implications for the Patching Tool The possibility of module sharing doesn't remove the requirement to apply a patch to each installation on a given filesystem. Applying the patch to each installation is required in order to: *  update any miscellaneous files * record the patching metadata for the particular installation * allow the patching tool to understand what combinations of layered distributions and add-ons are relevant to the given installation However, the patching tool should recognize the possibility of this kind of module sharing. When it applies a patch it should recognize that the modules may already exist on the filesystem and should not apply them again if not necessary. It should however record some information in, e.g. /modules/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 indicating that the installation being patched is using that set of patch modules. This information will prevent deletion of patch modules used by multiple installations if one of the installations uses the patching feature's cleanup functions. h1. OSGi Bundle Loading This needs discussion, but the basic concept is the precedence rules for OSGi bundle loading would following the same rules as for module loading.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - How to test web project from eclipse to jboss as7 without mvn jboss-as:deploy</header>
    <body>My firm is change the development environment, looking for some tricks and tips on how to work in the new environment. The current environment is Eclipse and Tomcat. We are developing web applications with Spring, Web Flow, and MySQL.. The new environment is going to be Eclipse, Jboss AS7 and Maven. Question 1: Now for the questions as the current time we run tomcat on the local workstations and I can use eclipse to write my code and then just click on “Run On Server” and eclipse will build the war file and start tomcat. With the new environment it does not look like Eclipse can start and stop and depoy right to Jboss AS so we are running a command line: mvn jboss-as:deploy does anyone know a better way? Question 2: Debugging.. Does anyone know how to get debugging working with eclipse and jboss as7. I would like to hear from other programmers that moved to jboss from tomcat</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Usage of ksession in Jbpm Spring Implementation</header>
    <body>Hi, I am developing a web application which I will invoke a jbpm workflow. I am following a *spring-jbpm* integeration pattern to create a *kbase,ksession* etc.My question is how we have to use the *ksession*? Means for each request I have to create a seperate session(every process instance has unique session id ) or multiple process instances sharing the same *ksession.* Currently I am following a spring approach in which one session id shared between multiple process instances. How to change this behaviour to make it one session per process instance.Is there any way to do this in spring. I tried bean scope"prototype" which will not workout. and jbpm session tag not having the attribute scope. My XML is: &lt;jbpm:kbase id="kbase"&gt;     &lt;jbpm:resources&gt;       &lt;jbpm:resource type="BPMN2" source="classpath:Hello.bpmn" /&gt;     &lt;/jbpm:resources&gt;   &lt;/jbpm:kbase&gt; &lt;jbpm:ksession id="ksession" type="stateful" kbase="kbase"&gt; &lt;jbpm:configuration&gt;       &lt;jbpm:jpa-persistence&gt;         &lt;jbpm:entity-manager-factory ref="entityManagerFactory"/&gt;         &lt;jbpm:transaction-manager ref="transactionManager"/&gt;       &lt;/jbpm:jpa-persistence&gt;     &lt;/jbpm:configuration&gt; &lt;/jbpm:ksession&gt; &lt;bean id="ds" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource"&gt; &lt;property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"&gt;&lt;/property&gt; &lt;property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jbpmworkflow?autoReconnect=true"/&gt; &lt;property name="username" value="root"/&gt; &lt;property name="password" value="root"/&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; &lt;bean id="entityManagerFactory" class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean"                   p:dataSource-ref="ds"&gt; &lt;property name="persistenceXmlLocation" value="classpath:META-INF/persistence.xml" /&gt; &lt;property name="persistenceUnitName" value="org.jbpm.persistence.jpa" /&gt; &lt;property name="jpaVendorAdapter"&gt; &lt;bean class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaVendorAdapter"&gt; &lt;property name="database" value="MYSQL"/&gt; &lt;property name="showSql" value="true"/&gt;   &lt;property name="databasePlatform" value="org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect" /&gt; &lt;/bean&gt;          &lt;/property&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; &lt;bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager" p:entityManagerFactory-ref="entityManagerFactory"&gt; &lt;property name="dataSource" ref="ds"/&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; Waiting eagerly for your replies. --Abuthahir</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - Re: LoginModule defined with cached=true, but called between web and ejb container</header>
    <body>Correct me if I'm wrong but it was a bug or at least bad programming practice on my part to invoke HttpServletRequest#logout and HttpSession#invalidate prior to LoginHistory#create.  I didn't notice the bug until I implemented Change Password workflow, which was when the FailedLoginException was thrown.  The problem was resolved by simply reversing the order e.g. invoking LoginHistory#create before logout.  However, it was troubling to learn that the EJB container was re-authenticating the user every time during the logout process after I explicitly invoked HttpServletRequest#logout and HttpSession.invalidate. So, if I understand you correctly, the security context remains established and userA (I'm assuming this means the principal) remains intact?  Wow.  Until now, I assumed that immediately upon invocation of logout and/or invalidate the security context was removed.  Perhaps it's not removed until the thread returns because of some requirement in the EJB spec, such as being able to pass principals across a chain of EJB calls?  Well... it was certainly confusing to receive a FailedLoginException when logging out   :)   and it was troubling that the application didn't receive an error except during logout under the unique circumstance when the user's password was changed during the session -- all because the EJB container was re-authenticating behind the scenes after logout was invoked. Just when I thought I was catching on, I'm confused again   ;)   I don't understand when you say that the EJB spec requires all EJB calls to be 'authenticated.'  It is my understanding that principals are authenticated -- not EJB calls -- and that EJB calls require access authorization -- not authentication.  If this is the case then referring back to my web application, since the security context (I'm assuming this means the principal) remains intact after invoking HttpServletRequest#logout and HttpSession#invalidate and until the thread returns there should be no reason to re-authenticate the principal before the thread returns.  In other words, if the principal is authenticated at login and logout is invoked but does not remove the security context, and during logout (e.g. before the thread returns) a secure EJB method is invoked, the EJB container should perform +access authorization+, checking that the user has the proper role, and not +authentication+, and, hence, the FailedLoginException should never be thrown after invoking logout before the thread returns.</body>

    <body>Using quartz in an EJB container has always been a bit evil because it creates threads, and you're not supposed to do that from an EJB. That said, it looks like the quartz-jboss implementation is only compatible with older versions of JBoss AS. It will be easier to use @Schedule as suggested above.</body>

    <body>Hi, Thank you guys for your feedback and suggestion. I will try to use @Schedule as you suggested. But I have succedded to work with quartz scheduler workable in my project. Below is the detail explanation - I have changed the MENIFEST.MF file of my EJB project in the following way - Manifest-Version: 1.0 Class-Path: Dependencies: org.slf4j,org.quartz I have also added the quartz jar file in jboss Module. In the module.xml file of the quartz module I have added the dependency of slf4j in the following way - &lt;module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="org.quartz"&gt;     &lt;resources&gt;         &lt;resource-root path="quartz-all-2.1.6.jar"/&gt;     &lt;/resources&gt;      &lt;dependencies&gt;         &lt;module name="org.slf4j"/&gt;     &lt;/dependencies&gt; &lt;/module&gt; Thats all. And now my shcedule is running properly.</body>

I want to build a process wich contains some business rules and i want to seperate the rules in an .drl file and use them for decisions in the process. I found  http://docs.jboss.com/jbpm/v4/devguide/html_single/#rulesdecision this example in the jpbm documentation but it doesn´t work and i don´t know why. I copied the drl file and the process xml definition to a new jbpm project. The first error is that the class org.jbpm.jpdl.internal.rules.Outcome is missed. I added the jar for org.jbpm.jpdl but it doesn´t contain the missed class. The second error is a null pointer exception in the in the process xml description an i don´t know where. Does anybody know some other simple examples for using rules-decision activities in jbpm? Thanks a lot!</body>

JASPIC seemed very viable to base this on, if it weren't for the issues with configuration, and among others the fact it's not active by default in JBoss AS/EAP (our showcase app runs on JBoss AS and EAP on OpenShift, so JBoss is obviously a very important target container for us).</body>

    <body>Role based access control to the AS7 management layer. *Core Concepts* * * When defining an RBAC model, the following conventions are useful: * Subject = A person or automated agent * Role = Job function or title which defines an authority level * Permissions = An approval of a mode of access to a resource * Action = An operation to execute on a resource * Constraint: Predicate that makes the permission valid in the context of the system state * Session = A mapping involving Subject, Role and/or Permissions https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-47854-28-19855/PermissonModel2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-47854-28-19855/450-235/PermissonModel2.png *Generic Requirements* * Provide a usable (in terms of complexity), yet comprehensive base model * Provide a set of out-of-the-box roles &amp; permissons that reflect common authorization requirements * Enable customizations/extension of the default scheme (i.e custom permissions, permission granularity) * Provide management operations to retrieve session information (i.e. roles assigned, permissions granted, etc) * Clearly distinguish security exceptions from other operation errors (i.e. custom response headers) * Mappability with existing authorisation schemes (i.e. JON) *Specific Requirements* * +Support permission enforcement that restricts visibility of model elements: +Control visibility of resources (i.e. restrict visibility of server groups) * +Suppor permission enforcement that restricts execution on model elements+: Control execution on resources (i.e. lock down certain operations, distinguish read &amp; read/write access) * +The management layer needs to enforce permission regardless of the client type and availability: +I.e. enformenent can not be delegated to the client only+ + * +Clients (CLI, Web) should indicate permissions prior to execution of management operations:+ I.e. grey out interface elements to emphasis lack of permissions *Use cases* See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47856 RBACUsecases* * *Advanced Topics* - Context based access control: i.e. Taking the connection into consideratin - Support for role hierarchies: i.e. structuring roles to reflect an organizations lines of authority and responsibility - Role constraints: i.e. mutual exclusive roles - RBAC to manage RBAC itself structuring roles to re  ect an organiza   tion  s lines of authority and resp onsibility</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>I have been working on the patch CLI command to patch an AS7 installation and add to tweak the code related to module to be able to generate a correct patch generated by diffing 2 AS7 installations. When comparing modules to check whether they have been updated, computing the dir's checksum is not correct: * Jar files generated during AS7 build can not have the same checksum since the creation date of the class files is store in the jar's zip entries. =&gt; this concerns AS7's own modules (org/jboss/as/...) and also jandex jars for 3rd party libraries To circumvent that, instead of computing the SHA-1 of the jar files, I compute the checksum of the file's zip entries name/size/crc (ie I exclude the date metadata). I also need to exclude some entries from the jar: * Some java sources are generated at build time (logger and bundle classes) and embed their generation date into the code =&gt; the .class files have different size and crc * META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and pom.properties files also contains the jar creation date =&gt; these files have different size and crc When a module dir is compared, .index files (generated at runtime) should not be taken into account (they are not present in the pristine AS7 installations I used to generate the patch by diff) I have a branch for this[1] which uses the same hash algo (based on the zip entries metadata) for all jars. This could likely be reduced only to jars in org/jboss/as and -jandex.jar. With these changes, the patch code is able to compute a "suitable" checksum for module. I also think the module's resource checksum should be based on the content of the module.xml. Only resources listed in the &lt;resources&gt; element should be included in the checksum. Eg adding a README to a module should not change its checksum. This means a 2-step check: 1. check that the module.xml are identical (with a file checksum) 2. check that the resources listed by the module are "equivalent" (with jar-specific checksum for jar + file checksum for other resources) What do you think?

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Messaging Development] - clustering problem with JBoss Messaging in JBoss 5.1</header>
    <body>We have a cluster environment with two nodes (Node1 and Node2) of JBoss 5.1. We have two queues deployed. When we bring up the Node1 and view consumer count of queue in admin-console it shows consumer count as 1 for each queue. Till now everything fine and work as expected. When we bring up the Node2 of cluster and view consumer count of queues in admin-console of both the node, we observe a random behavior sometime consumer count is incremented to 2 on Node1 whereas  consumer count stays 0 on Node 2 and some time it is increase to 1 on Node2. When we have consumers for queues on both the node i.e. Node1 Queue1 consumer count =1 Node1 Queue2 consumer count =1 Node2 Queue1 consumer count=1 Node2 Queue2 consumer count=1 Everything work as expected BUT When we have a situation like Node1 Queue1 consumer count =2 Node1 Queue2 consumer count =1 Node2 Queue1 consumer count=0 Node2 Queue2 consumer count=1 Then all the messages which reach Node2 Queue1 are not processed. When one of the nodes goes down these failover happens and these messages get processed This situation is happening very often.

    <body>Further update on this: Actually messaging on Node2 Queue1 was getting processed for some time probably because we are using ClusterPullConnectionFactory but after some time it’s stopped. After investigating this problem I found that we are using ClusteredConnectionFactory with MDB, and this factory is not suitable to use with MDB. Looking at following posts and issues https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-10095 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBMCluster “JBoss Messaging Clustering 1.4.x Overview” https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBMESSAGING-843 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBMESSAGING-843 “Clustered ConnectionFactory with no load balancing, but failover capabilities needed.” I figured out that setting SupportsLoadBalancing to false for ClusteredConnectionFactory will make things work. Please let me know if my observations are incorrect.</body>

    <body>I am currently evaluting the jBPM offering from JBoss and have a few questions.  When I look at the BPMS editor under the JBoss tools plugin in Eclipse I see only 2 service tasks included with the tool (Log, Email) and 13 components.  Do I have the complete set?  Does the paid for version offer more functionality?  If I need to build a work flow that requires connecting to an external REST webserice, do I need to build my own Service Task to do that?  And, one last question, If I am trying to inject data into a workflow from session.startSession() and then access the same data in WorkItemHandler downstream in the flow.  At a high level, how would I do that?

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>Jeff, This will need to be more complex. For a CP, we don't want to ignore AS modules just because the only change is creation dates. If you apply a CP patch, the modules you should run should be the same as if you had downloaded a fresh install of that version. I discussed this with Jimmy Wilson of GSS a while back. A critical question is whether a build of a product involves a complete rebuild from source of all 3rd party libs, or whether an existing built-from-source binary is re-used if the source is unchanged. I expect the latter; otherwise a new maven GAV would be needed for every build. And if that is case, again, for a CP there is no reason not to include a 3rd party module even if the diff is only creation dates. For whatever reason the module was rebuilt. For one-off patches, the patch generator includes the ability for the patch-config to explicitly declare what modules are different. I did this as something of a workaround to the problem you're attacking. The person preparing the one-off will probably do a complete big from source of a tag + bug-fix patch, and generating a diff of that will produce spurious diffs. Your approach here provides another way to help with this case. But it shouldn't be done for CPs and for one-offs the patch-config should include a config to turn it off. Re: the .index files, I had some discussions about those and I thought they were no longer being generated. If that's wrong, then yes, we'll need to deal with them. I'm not in favor of analyzing the module.xml to determine what resources to hash. For two reasons: 1) The user-side patch tool shouldn't add any functionality that isn't really necessary. The more it does, the more ways it can break. And breaking is bad. 2) It's not the business of the patch tool to parse and understand the contents of module.xml. If jboss-modules changes something, we don't want to have to update the patch tool to understand that. I don't think it's a big deal if users stick a README in a module and we treat that as a conflict. The users looks, sees the difference (the README would likely have a different filesystem date from the rest of the module) and provides the param to the patching operation indicating that it's ok to override modules with conflicts.</body>

    <body>Hi guys, I am developing new extension for Jboss 7.1.1.Final for project needs and actually, thanx to people who did the documentation and archetype, I am pretty done. One thing which is not disclosed in documentation and which I cannot find anywhere is how to define dependencies in my subsystem or extension -  practically how to say jboss, that my extension depends on other subsystems. In my example I get datasource name and topic configured for my subsystem as simple string attributes (can be I had to use something else - dunno - so far string). But how can I ensure, that "datasources" and "messaging" subsystems are started and have already deployed their stuff  (datasources and topics) before start of my subsystem is called? As I said this topic is not documented well and unfortunatelly I could not find much info on it. Javadoc is also mostly absent. Many thanks for your help in advance. Dmitri</body>

"multi-JSF" allows installation of multiple JSF implementations (and versions) on the same AS7 server.  The goal is to allow use of any JSF implementation (MyFaces or Mojarra) and any version of those implementation from JSF 1.1 all the way up to the experimental JSF 2.2 versions.  This is far superior to the old WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL method because JSF jars do not need to be bundled with the webapp.  More importantly, "multi-JSF" provides an implementation that is fully integrated with the container.  This means more efficient annotation processing, lifecycle handling, and other integration advantages. *How it works* The way multi-JSF will work is that for each JSF version, a new slot is created in the modules path under *com.sun.jsf-impl*, *javax.faces.api*, and *org.jboss.as.jsf-injection*.  When the jsf-subsystem is started, it scans the module path to find all the installed JSF implementations.  When the JSF subsystem deploys a web app containing the specified context param, it adds the slotted modules to the deployment.  Here is an example of the context param for the latest milestone of Mojarra 2.2: &lt;context-param&gt;    &lt;param-name&gt;org.jboss.jbossfaces.JSF_CONFIG_NAME&lt;/param-name&gt;    &lt;param-value&gt;mojarra-2.2.0-m05&lt;/param-value&gt; &lt;/context-param&gt; *How a JSF implementation is installed* A single JSF implementation is installed using a  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18945 CLI deployment archive.  This archive includes the required jars and module.xml files.  It also includes CLI scripts for installing/uninstalling the JSF impls using the  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4265 CLI module command.  You execute the installation archive like this: The install script inside the archive looks like this: *How the CLI deployment archives are created* A CLI deployment archive for a JSF implementation/version is created using a standalone maven project you can  https://github.com/ssilvert/jboss-jsf-installer download from GitHub and run.  To create an archive with the project, you  call it like this: *mojarra example* *myfaces example* This pulls in the JSF resources and creates the install/uninstall scripts.  It is all bundled together in an archive (zip) file that must be manually renamed with a .cli extension. *How to change the default JSF implementation in AS7* The multi-JSF feature adds two new attributes to the JSF subsystem.  The first, +active-jsf-impls+, is just a read-only list of the installed JSF implementations.  The second, +default-jsf-impl-slot+, allows you to change the default JSF implementation.  You just need to issue a write-attribute command and set the value to one of the active impls.  Then restart AS7. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-47689-5-19878/JSF-subsys-attribs.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-47689-5-19878/450-187/JSF-subsys-attribs.png Alternatively, you can set this in your configuration file, such as standalone.xml: &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:jsf:1.0" default-jsf-impl-slot="mojarra-2.2.0-m05"/&gt; *Demo* I've attached a copy of install-mojarra-2.2.0-m05.cli and install-myfaces-2.1.8.cli.  You can unzip to take a look at it.  You can even deploy it with the latest nightly build of AS7.   This will let you see how the modules are installed.   I'm not quite done with updates to the jsf-subsystem, so you can't see multi-jsf in action on a webapp yet.  If you want to try it out though, let me know.  I can upload a working version to my github account.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - How can I determine when the ModelController service is fully started</header>
    <body>I have an OSGi service that provides container properties (i.e. JBoss Model) to our other OSGi bundles. We moved to a late October build of 7.2.0.Alpha1 from 7.1.1.Final. With the move, the startup timing between the ModelController service and the OSGi deployments changed.  When my code queried the model before it was fully started, the Model Controller was returning a successful operation outcome, but the query would return an undefined value. With the latest build from github attribute queries prior to a started state now quite rightly return an unsuccessful operation outcome, and the following error is logged 2012-11-15 15:35:39,436 ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation](EclipseGeminiBlueprintExtenderThread-18) JBAS014613: Operation ("read-attribute") failed - address: ([("interface" =&gt; "internal")]) - failure description: "JBAS014807: Management resource '[(\"interface\" =&gt; \"internal\")]' not found" My question is, what can I test to make sure the Model and Service are fully started before querying, in order to avoid these errors being logged ? I tried using the controller state before, but it wasn't actually changing to indicate it had started.</body>

It currently has a flaw in that it doesn't transition to ControlledProcessState.State.STOPPING at the correct time in the case of a soft kill (Ctrl-C, kill -3).

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS Development Deployment Framework] - Unfinished deployment in JBoss 7.1.1 on linux</header>
    <body>Hi, After some porting changes from JBoss 5.1.0 to JBoss 7.1.1 our application worked fine on Windows 7 platform. When trying to deploy this application on linux machine (both Ubuntu and RedHat, were tried) I encounter an issue by which deployment enters idle state. After investigating the issue I realized that a servlet in its init() method is awaiting for the proxy component that represents my EJB stateless session bean. The code snippets below leads to the 'gate' flag for that component that on Windows 7 is 'ture' and on linux machine is 'false': # componentName                    | CAAdminSessionBean # componentClass          | class org.ejbca.core.ejb.ca.caadmin.CAAdminSessionBean # org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.stateless.StatelessSessionComponent(org.jboss.as.ee.component.BasicComponent)                     ...             // Block until successful start                     // TODO: check for failure condition The stack of JBoss Interceptors is given in reverse order to track back the issue that starts in servlet: The interesting thing is that the proxy for local interface is created (it is represented by View39), but the bean itselft is not - this is indicated by gate = false flag. # # org.ejbca.core.ejb.ca.caadmin.CAAdminSessionLocal$$$View39 # Proxy for view class: org.ejbca.core.ejb.ca.caadmin.CAAdminSessionLocal of EJB: CAAdminSessionBean # caAdminSession   | org.ejbca.core.ejb.ca.caadmin.CAAdminSessionLocal # # # org.ejbca.ui.web.admin.configuration.StartServiceServlet             . . .             . . . # org.jboss.as.ee.component.ProxyInvocationHandler         // special location for original proxy         // setup the public context data # org.jboss.invocation.ChainedInterceptor # org.jboss.invocation.InterceptorContext # org.jboss.as.ee.component.TCCLInterceptor # # org.jboss.as.ejb3.tx.CMTTxInterceptor             case MANDATORY:             case NEVER:             case NOT_SUPPORTED:             case REQUIRED:             case REQUIRES_NEW:             case SUPPORTS:             default: # org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.pool.PooledInstanceInterceptor # StrictMaxPool                     . . .             // Pool is empty, create an instance                     . . . # org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.stateless.StatelessSessionComponent             @Override             @Override # componentName | CAAdminSessionBean # componentClass | class org.ejbca.core.ejb.ca.caadmin.CAAdminSessionBean # org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.stateless.StatelessSessionComponent(org.jboss.as.ee.component.BasicComponent)   ...             // Block until successful start                     // TODO: check for failure condition The structure of the application ear file is 8 war modules, 2 ejb modules and the library jars under lib entry: adminweb.war ... more 7 wars ... ejbca-ejb.jar ejbca-ws-ejb.jar I tried following things: 1. Changed @Stateless(mappedName=__old_jndiName__ to @Stateless(mappedName=java:global/ejbca/ejbca-ejb/CAAdminSessionBean!org.ejbca.ca.caadmin.CAAdminSessionRemote) 2. Added below entry to standalone.xml to explicitly tie war module with ejb. &lt;ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;false&lt;/ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt; 3.  Added jboss-deployment-structure.xml file to META-INF of ear file to explicitly tie war module with ejb. &lt;jboss-deployment-structure&gt;   &lt;sub-deployment name="adminweb.war"&gt;     &lt;dependencies&gt;       &lt;module name="deployment.ejbca.ear.ejbca-ejb.jar" /&gt;     &lt;/dependencies&gt;   &lt;/sub-deployment&gt; &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt; The latter led to unnecessary dependencies errors in the logs.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - ManagementLayer	RBAC</header>
    <body>I added a requirement to secure JMX interactions that don't end up delegating into the normal ModelController layer (i.e. mbeans outside the jboss-as JMX domain.) My hope is such mbeans can simply be another type of resource, with a different kind of address (ObjectName instead of PathAddress). I think that if there is any overlap in the permission configuration between JMX and the core management model, the allowed actions for a given request become the intersection of the sets of permissions. IOW, if the JMX scheme allows access to mbean jboss-as:subsystem=security but the core management model doesn't allow access to /subsystem=security, then the request will fail. This can be accomplished by doing a permission check in the JMX layer, and then the normal core management check is done in the core layer. Another option is to not allow JMX permissions to be set up for the JMX domains that result in calls into the core management layer.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>Regarding "Patching Deployments" along with the "Mixed Approach" prototype described in  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-25627 ExtendingAS7 page. The prototype says to package the deployment (say, an EAR) in an unexploded, zipped format (so you literally would have one file in the module called "mydep.ear" or "myapp.war"). Should it be possible to allow for the Mixed Approach to deploy exploded content (so the module would have a directory structure "mydep.ear/&lt;the content&gt;"). How would this affect this patching mechanism? I bring this up because of the following use-case : suppose we have legacy code (that used to go in the scanned deployments directory but will now be using the new Mixed Approach method) - and that legacy code reads individual files from within the ear (and could even WRITE files to directories under the ear). So, the questions are: 1) Can the Mixed Approached deploy exploded content (the prototype's code assumes unexploded, I'm not sure what the code should look like if it wants to deploy exploded deployments)? 2) Does deployment of exploded content via the Mixed Approach present any problems/issues wrt the new patching mechanism?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss ESB Development] - How to conditionally	execute an action</header>
    <body>Hi, Is there a way in JBoss ESB so that an action can be conditionally executed. My requirement is to conditionally transform an XML if the incoming XML has an attribute resubmitmode with tag value as true. Is there any way to do this with SmooksAction. I want to avoid the transformation if the tag value is false. &lt;p:resubmitMode&gt;true&lt;/p:resubmitMode&gt; I did a lot of R&amp;D but could not get this working. One alternative taht came to mind was to add a transformation/XSLT rule but not sure if that would work I am using JBOSS SOA Enterprise platform 5.3 and ESB 4.11 Kindly help Thanks Heena</body>

    <body>IMHO authentication works with the latest version, but the propagation of the JAAS LoginContext (ClientLoginModule) is still unsupported. This means if you call javax.ejb.EJBContext.getCallerPrincipal(), lookup javax.security.auth.Subject.container via javax.security.jacc.PolicyContext or similar you will get the default user specified in the client properties or on the remote-outbound-connection. I'd greatly appreciate any samples on how to implement remote client calls with different authentications in AS7.</body>

If I want to start the process from script number two, is there a way? Thanks all for your attention Regards, Leo</body>

    <body>Hi Mauricio Salatino, thanks for answering. My problem is to create a web project (i.e. using JSPs) and then kind of invoke a bpmn process, which invokes a jsp aswell, and then I need to go back to the bpmn (and again and again and again...). That's where I find problems, is it possible to return to a bpmn process which already started and called the jsp I am visualizing? Sorry, I may not explain myself clearly. Tell me if I still couldn't make the point. Thanks, Leo</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single Installation	Patching</header>
    <body>This article outlines design notes for the single instance patching feature being developed for AS 7.2. The 7.2 version of the feature will be apply to apply a patch to a single installation of the AS (i.e. a single unzip of the AS distribution.) That single installation may be being used for a standalone server or for a managed domain Host Controller and servers. However, the 7.2 version will not support coordinated patching by the patching tool of multiple installation in a managed domain. The user can of course independently patch multiple installation in a domain, coordinating the application of those patches themselves. The basic patching process will consist of: 1. The user obtains a patch file. 2. The user uses the CLI tool to connect to a standalone server or Host Controller that is running on the installation that is to be patched.1. The server or Host Controller may be running in admin-only mode or running normally. However, some patches may not be able to be applied if the target process isn't running in admin-only mode 3. The user invokes a command on the CLI providing the location of the patch file. The CLi invokes an operation(s) on the target process telling it to stage the patch. 4. The target process stages the patch by applying the patch contents to the filesystem.1. The changes made to the filesystem during staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before applying the patch. 5. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the staged patch is visible in the runtime. Patches can also be rolled back: 1. The user can use the CLI tool to instruct the target process to revert a patch. 2. Patch reversion results in changes to the filesystem that are staged in the same manner as what is done with a patch installation.1. The changes made to the filesystem during patch rollback staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch rollback with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before rolling back the patch. 3. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the rolled back patch is no longer visible in the runtime. h1. Patch File A patch file is a zip archive that contains a patch.xml file that is used to describe the patch along with the updated modules, OSGi bundles and miscellaneous files that comprise the patch. It's structure is as follows: + patch.xml + modules ++ patch modules in the same structure as they appear the modules dir in the normal AS dist + bundles ++ patch bundles in the same structure as they appear the bundles dir in the normal AS dist + misc ++ misc files that need to be updated, organized in a directory structure that matches the directory structure of the AS dist h3. The patch.xml File The patch.xml file describes the patch. It includes basic information about the patch along with metadata about the modules, bundles and misc files in the patch. h5. Basic patch metadata * The name of the patch * The type of the patch (one-off vs cumulative, etc -- TODO list all) * The version to which the patch applies * A text description of the patch * TODO others h5. Module metadata * The name of the module * The slot of the module * The hash of the module.xml file of the previous version of the module. Not present if the relevant module did not exist in the version being patched. h5. Removed module metadata Identifies modules that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed module * The slot of the removed module h5. Bundle metadata * TODO anything? h5. Removed bundle metadata Identifies bundles that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed bundle h5. Misc file metadata * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file did not exist in the version being patched, or if the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h5. Removed misc file metadata Identifies misc files that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the relevant file is a directory. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h2. Patch Staging The target process when it applies a patch will create a patches directory directly underneath the root of the AS distribution. As with other directories, the location of this directory can be controlled via a system property passed to the JVM at process launch. Before patch staging begins, a check is made as to whether the target process is in admin-only mode. If it is not, and an unresolvable conflict is detected between a module, bundle or miscellaneous file contained in the patch and a user-modification of the corresponding item in the installation being patched, the patch staging process will be aborted with an error message.  See "Patch Conflict Detection" below. h4. Modules Patch modules will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. Information about the location of this directory will be stored in a location visible to the module loader used by JBoss Modules at boot.  This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the module loader currently in use by the target process. For modules that the patch "removes", the patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory will include that module, but with a special module.xml file and no other contents. The module.xml file will include the tag &lt;missing/&gt;. The JBoss Modules release used with this will interpret that &lt;missing/&gt; tag and if seen will throw a ModuleNotFoundException (which is what it would throw if it were unable to locate a module.  The nice thing about this approach is if a later patch adds back the removed module, that patch will take precedence in the module path, and the "missing" module.xml will be irrelevant. h4. Bundles Patch bundes will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the OSGi subsystem currently in use by the target process. Information about removed bundles will also be stored in a location visible to the OSGi subsystem at next boot. TODO see if an approach similar to the &lt;missing/&gt; approach can be used. h4. Misc files Misc files are staged by copying them directly to their normal location on the filesystem. A copy of the existing file at that location will be stored in the patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. TODO describe check for user-modified misc files. h4. Configuration files Patches will not modify the configuration files of the target process. Configuration patching will not be supported in this version of the feature (and may never be supported.)  Configuration files belong to the user. However, a copy of all existing configuration files will be made in a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. During patch rollback, these configuration files will be restored. This backup is necessary because once the patch is applied to the runtime, any management operation that results in persistence of the configuration will use the xml schemas associated with the patched version of the core AS and any subsystems. If the patch is reverted, those schemas may not be intelligible to the version of the code to which the runtime has been reverted. h2. Patch Application A patch is "applied" by stopping the target process and then restarting it in a normal manner; e.g. from the command line or by using the :shutdown(restart=true) command from the CLI. The patch contents that have been staged are then used by the restarted process. h4. Modules In 7.2 the AS will use a custom implementation of the JBoss Modules ModuleLoader interface, instead of the default implementation used in previous AS 7 releases. The selection of this custom implementation will be part of the launch VM command created by the startup scripts (i.e. standalone.sh/standalone.bat/domain.sh/domain.bat). The module loader works using a notion of a "module path", which is an ordered list of directories in which modules are located. When the module loader needs to find a module, it searches the directories in that path in order, and once it finds the desired module the search ends. Thus, directories earlier in the path listing take precedence over those found later. This is all very similar to how an OS uses the $PATH environment variable. Previous AS7 releases allowed the user to specify a $JBOSS_MODULES_PATH environment variable to declare the "module path", with a default value of $JBOSS_HOME/modules used if not specified. The startup scripts used to the AS pass that module path into JBoss Modules (via the -mp &lt;the_path&gt; argument to java.)  In AS 7.2, the custom module loader we will use will support this behavior, but in addition the custom module loader we provide will be able to examine the patching metadata that will be persisted in the "staging" phase and from that will determine which of the patch-specific subdirectories of the patches directory need to be prepended to the module path. In addition, for modules that have been removed in patches, the custom module loader will know to not load those modules, even though the modules will still remain on the filesystem. h4. Bundles TODO -- basic idea is to do something similar to how modules work, but the details need to be sorted out. h4. Misc Files Application of miscellaneous files to the runtime is straightforward. The staging step places the patch's miscellaneous files in the normal location that the runtime services will expect, so when the target process is restarted, the runtime services see them. h2. Rollback Staging To do a patch rollback, the target process must be placed in admin-only mode. TODO h4. Modules TODO h4. Bundles TODO h4. Misc Files The backup copies of the miscellaneous files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored to their normal locations. Any misc files that were added as part of the "Patch Staging" process (i.e. those that were new in the patch) will be removed. h4. Configuration The backup copies of the configuration files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored. *+Any configuration changes made while the patch was in place will be lost.+* h2. Rollback Application A patch rollback is "applied" by stopping the target process and then restarting it in a normal manner; e.g. from the command line or by using the :shutdown(restart=true) command from the CLI. The modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that have been staged are then used by the restarted process. Issue: the client tool (i.e. CLI) may need to be able to roll back a patch itself, not relying on the target process to do it. This is because a failed patch may leave the target process in a state such that it is unable to respond to commands from the CLI. This capability will not work remotely -- the CLI process will need to be running on the same machine as the installation being patched, and running under a user account with the necessary filesystem permissions to update the filesystem. h4. Modules See the discussion in "Patch Application" above of how the module path works. When a patch is rolled back, the metadata the custom module loader uses to construct the module path will no longer indicate the patch's modules should be on the path, so they will not be available for loading. h4. Bundles TODO -- basic idea is to do something similar to how modules work, but the details need to be sorted out. h4. Misc Files As was the case in the discussion in "Patch Application" above, the patch rollback staging step places the correct miscellaneous files in the normal location that the runtime services will expect, so when the target process is restarted, the runtime services see them. h2. Patch Conflict Detection At the beginning of the patch staging process, a check will be made for conflicts between the patch and any user modifications to the same item. The user when executing the patch command can provide information to guide the tool in resolving conflicts. Any conflicts that cannot be resolved will result in the patch staging being aborted with no changes to the filesystem. Conflict types are: * Modules. If the patch is updating or removing an existing module, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing module's contents. The patching process will hash the current module's contents to check for modifications. If any affected module is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some modules and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to a module, they will need to make an equivalent change to the patch module. The sole purpose of this "module conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Bundles: If the patch is updating or removing an existing bundle, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing bundle's contents. The patching process will hash the current bundle's contents to check for modifications. If any affected bundle is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified bundles is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some bundles and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to a bundle, they will need to make an equivalent change to the patch bundle. The sole purpose of this "bundle conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Misc files: If the patch is updating an existing misc file, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing file. If the patch is removing an existing directory, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing directory's contents. The patching process will hash the current file or directory to check for modifications. If any affected file/directory is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a permission indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. If no permission is available for a particular file or directory, the conflict will be treated as unresolved. These permissions can come in four forms:* A global permission to update all conflicting misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tool's patching command * A global permission to not update any conflicting misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tool's patching command * A file containing* a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is granted. * a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is denied, meaning the existing file should be retained. The patching feature will also include a command that can apply this conflict detection process and provide a report of conflicts. Users can use this command to check for conflicts in advance. TODO describe how this will work for patch rollback. h2. Patch Generation Tool * Accepts basic metadata along with the location of a distribution of the new version along with a distribution of the old version* Also includes details on any misc files that are expected to be in active use * Generates a patch.xml file * Can generate a full patch file * Optional: Can be run from inside the bin/ dir of the full distribution of the new version and if provided with the patch.xml file can generate a patch file from the contents of the full dist* Idea here is the patch.xml file could be distributed as part of the new version and the user could use it to generate patch h4.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Web Development] - UI Testing of Util Classes deployed on JBoss</header>
    <body>In a Maven project, We have consumed a number of third party web services using Spring Framework. The flow would be something like below and controlled by the respective applicationContext.xml: Service Class -&gt; Request Validator -&gt; Request Mapper -&gt; Manager -&gt; Response Mapper -&gt; Service Class. In another Maven project, (where the above project is added as a dependency in the pom.xml), There is a Util Class for every service and this Util Maven project is exposed as a shared library to all the UI applications. Is there any framework provided by JBoss where these util classes can be registered and tested in a standalone web page (not in the application), this is to ensure that all the services work properly when deployed on a server. Say, if a method in a util class has three arguments (two are primitive and other is user defined) , framework should automatically list out the required text boxes. When the user enters the values, they should bind to the respective arguments and the util call has to be made. Could you please suggest if there is any framework in jboss or any other ideas to achieve this goal? Thanks, Devikumar R</body>

    <body>What about invoking the EJB's through RMI-IIOP? Is this a good idea? I've been trying to set up something similar to use JTS albeit with less instances. As a reference, I was looking at the JTS quickstart. Although, in this quickstart it sets up the reference using injection, I was able to lookup the exported EJB through the JNDI. In my initial tests it works and I don't need to statically configure all the references to my instances in jboss config; I just pass a different host and port.</body>

    <body>I don't think that's deprecated. Personally I didn't use that approach because I had lots of difficulties using EJBClientContext.setSelector(this.selector) because I was trying to invoke EJB's in one container instance from inside another instance. Firstly the setSelector has permissions locked from the security manager and secondly the JTS couldn't commit the transaction. The transaction manager commit runs in another thread with another classloader and I had no control over the client context it tries to use.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: How to programatically manage 1, 000 to 6, 000 outbound ejb connections in JBoss7?</header>
    <body>Right you would have to use reflection to access our selector: https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/ejb3/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/ejb3/remote/TCCLEJBClientContextSelectorService.java https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/blob/master/ejb3/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/ejb3/remote/TCCLEJBClientContextSelectorService.java And then do some kind of alter connect change and restore. Unfortunately due to a bug, you would have to control the transaction manually. If you are using JTS though, and you want to participate in container transactions on the client side (the one making the remote call) you could look at using IIOP, it allows you to dynamically register a connection. I have bookmarked your usecase with the work we are doing in EJBCLIENT-34. I hope to make sure it is covered without any hacking.</body>

    <body>Just out of curiousity, what was really wrong with providing a URL to initial context? I remember initial posts about AS 7 saying that the main reason for dropping it was that is was not in the Java EE and EJB specs, and JBoss wanted to explore alternative ways. Maybe I've missed a post, but I've never really seen an explanation that detailed what was really wrong with the URL approach.</body>

    <body>Thanks. I am using IIOP. From what tests I have done it appears to work well. Actually, I would suggest that using IIOP could be the solution to the original problem. Aside from offering JTS support it allows a hostname:port style API which is much more "JBoss 4,5,6" as James put it.</body>

There are few questions on the jBPM which i am listing below:    1. Does jBPM support XML type support?    2. I have seen a new Eclipse Editor in the below mentioned link and downloaded the same in my eclipse. The problem is that it does not have a sound document on its usage. Is this an offical release by JBOSS or for evalaution purpose. http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v5.3/userguide/ch.eclipse-bpmn-plugin.html http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v5.3/userguide/ch.eclipse-bpmn-plugin.html   3. I have created a jBPM project in Eclipse and created bpmn processes in it. How do i need to deploy in any server? Do i need to export it as WAR or JAR or is there any other alternative around.  If i am planning to use guvnor for storing my processes, how can that be achieved?  I am more concerned with this point. Please reply me ASAP so that i can proceed with my evaluation. Regards vaski</body>

I understand that JBossWeb is a forked version of Apache Tomcat, and the documentation (FAQ) mentioned that "JBoss Web is based on Tomcat 6.0.13 and we have been porting the needed fixes for Tomcat to JBoss Web. The latest version of JBoss Web corresponds to the latest version of Tomcat for the patches and security fixes." I'm in need of find a version of JBoss that is at the same patchs and security fixes level as Apache Tomcat 6.0.35 (the lasted release from Apache Tomcat for the 6.0.x series, dated 2011-11-28).

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JBoss AS7 Logging</header>
    <body>This article describes the logging configuration starting JBoss AS v7.0.0.  The article should be updated periodically with any changes that have happened to logging (and note the version where the change occurred). h2. h2. Boot Logging This is the +boot.log+ that you see.  Its configuration is in the +logging.properties+. h2. h2. Server Logging The configuration should be done in the +standalone.xml+ for the standalone distribution.  Basically the configuration now is done in the domain model. So it is either +domain.xml+ or +standalone.xml+ depending on the type of distribution. The log output will go into server.log h2. h2. Deployment Level Logging This is when you want to have your own JDK or Log4J logging driven at the deployment level.  This feature was implemented by  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBAS-9084 JBAS-9084 /  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-514 AS7-514 . h2. h2. How do I? Suppose you want to enable trace level logging on org.jboss.security,  this is how the standalone.xml block looks: &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:1.0"&gt;             &lt;console-handler name="CONSOLE" autoflush="true"&gt;                 &lt;level name="INFO"/&gt;                 &lt;formatter&gt;                 &lt;/formatter&gt;             &lt;/console-handler&gt;             &lt;periodic-rotating-file-handler name="FILE" autoflush="true"&gt;                 &lt;level name="TRACE"/&gt;                 &lt;formatter&gt;                 &lt;/formatter&gt;                 &lt;file relative-to="jboss.server.log.dir" path="server.log"/&gt;                 &lt;suffix value=".yyyy-MM-dd"/&gt;             &lt;/periodic-rotating-file-handler&gt;             &lt;logger category="com.arjuna"&gt;                 &lt;level name="WARN"/&gt;             &lt;/logger&gt;             &lt;logger category="org.apache.tomcat.util.modeler"&gt;                 &lt;level name="WARN"/&gt;             &lt;/logger&gt;             &lt;logger category="sun.rmi"&gt;                 &lt;level name="WARN"/&gt;             &lt;/logger&gt;             &lt;logger category="org.jboss.security"&gt;                 &lt;level name="TRACE"/&gt;             &lt;/logger&gt; Note that I added a logger block for "org.jboss.security".  Now I need to also change the level for the appender -either CONSOLE or FILE. In most cases, you want to do it for FILE.  Now enjoy the trace entries. h2. h2.

So we need to migrate existing V1 and V2 tasks to V3 version so that they can be still handled. We have tried to see how it was set in jBPM database but we could not manage to change a task from V2 to V3 workkflow for example. When we try to delete and re-create the task with same data, it's always set at first workflow step instead of the one it was before. Can you help us figuring it out please?

    <body>Hi, I am doing some R&amp;D in jbpm 5.2. I had done some goow examples. Now I want to manage users/groups information for the tasks. As mentioned in the documentation the new users/groups can be added by mentining its details in the *LoadUsers.mvel,LoadGroups.mvel* inside the *task-servoce* folder. Fine. The password and the roles information are mentioned in the *users.properties,roles.properties* under the jbpm-console-server.war file. Now I am assigning a human task for the group  example *"QA"* means that only people who belongs to *QA* can claim and execute the task. But now every users are able to see the task and able to claim?Why it goes wrong here? How to avoid that? There are some predefined groups like *admin,user,manager* if the user is part of any of these groups then only he is able to login to *jbpm-console*. Where these groups are defined?and what are their priviledges? And for each time if I restart my human task service the task related tables are created everytime.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - if-else control flow</header>
    <body>h4. if-else controll flow was introduced in 7.2 builds With if-else control flow you can choose which set of commands and operations to execute based on a condition. The condition is a boolean expression which evaluates the response of the operation (or command) specified in the if statement. Let's look at an example if (outcome != success) of /system-property=test:read-resource     /system-property=test:add(value=true) end-if The *if* statement can be read as "if the outcome attribute of /system-property=test:read-resource response is not success (which means the property does not exist) then add the property and initialize it to true". To understand the condition expression better, the result of +/system-property=test:read-resource+ if the test property doesn't exist will be [standalone at localhost:9999 /] /system-property=test:read-resource     "outcome" =&gt; "failed",     "failure-description" =&gt; "JBAS014807: Management resource '[(\"system-property\" =&gt; \"test\")]' not found",     "rolled-back" =&gt; true You can see that the *outcome* attribute equals *failed*, so the expression in our *if* statement will evaluate to true and the body of the *if* will be executed. If we execute +read-resource+ after the *if* again we'll see [standalone at localhost:9999 /] /system-property=test:read-resource     "outcome" =&gt; "success", Here is another example which demonstrates *if* with *else* and inverts the true-false value every time it's executed. It also shows how you can navigate the response, i.e. it evaluates attribute *value* - the child *result* - using a dot. if (result.value == true) of /system-property=test:read-resource     /system-property=test:write-attribute(name=value,value=false) else     /system-property=test:write-attribute(name=value,value=true) end-if The *of* keyword can be followed by any management command or an operation which results in a response from the controller. And condition expressions can contain • the whitespaces are insignificant and ignored. E.g. something like this could be a valid condition expression: ((a==b || c.c1&lt;=d &amp;&amp; e.e1.e2&gt;f) &amp;&amp; g!=h || i&gt;=j) &amp;&amp; (k&lt;l &amp;&amp; m&gt;n || o==p) If you use a navigation path and the path doesn't exist then the expression (the comparison which involves the path) will evaluate to false. The examples above are simple and show only one operation in the bodies of the *if* and *else* but there is no such limitation. Each if/else body is a batch (which will be translated into a single composite operation) and can contain any number of commands and operations. Although, nested if-else and try-catch-finally are not yet supported.</body>

Introduction This article differs from: http://community.jboss.org/wiki/IntegrationWithTibcoEMS IntegrationWithTibcoEMS and the TibcoEMS administration documents in the following: * Does not replace and remove JBoss messaging from the JBoss Installation (JBoss messaging can still be removed, but this is optional since the DefaultJMSProvider has not been replaced) * Defines a TIBCOJMSProvider * Provides a DLQ configuration without changing standardjboss.xml and replacing the DefaultJMSProvider with TIBCOJMSProvider * Has been tested on JBoss EAP 5 * Uses authentication with Tibco EMS h2. Credits The content in this page is based on TibcoEMS documentation for JBoss4.x. Some of the content has also been borrowed from the article: http://community.jboss.org/wiki/IntegrationWithTibcoEMS IntegrationWithTibcoEMS including the sample mdb code for testing. A special thanks to Marjono Reksopuro, Susanta Mondal and Michael McKernan for their help with Tibco Administration, integration and testing for this configuration. h2. TibcoEMS Configuration The steps in this section outline the steps required to create a test queue on TibcoEMS as well as the DLQ. ** Please note this EMS configuration assumes the following:* - Authorization enabled - Username/Password are set to: admin/admin  - A single instance running locally:   localhost with port of 7222. - If you need to have FT Pairs for failover, the url should be changed from   tcp://localhost:7222, tcp://localhost:7222  to  tcp://firstmachine:firstport,tcp://secondmachine:secondport h3. Step1 Start the tibemsd server and the tibemsadmin console. Queues and Connection Factories h3. Step2 Create two queues (queue/myTestQueue and queue/DLQ) and two XA connection factories (TIBXAQueueConnectionFactory and TIBXATopicConnectionFactory), by entering the following commands in tibemsadmin:           &gt; connect     &gt; create queue queue/myTestQueue     &gt; create queue queue/DLQ     &gt; create factory TIBXAQueueConnectionFactory xaqueue url=tcp://localhost:7222     &gt; create factory TIBXATopicConnectionFactory xatopic url= tcp://localhost:7222 Tibco pairs for Failover:     &gt; create factory TIBXAQueueConnectionFactory xaqueue url=tcp://localhost:7222, tcp://localhost:7222     &gt; create factory TIBXATopicConnectionFactory xatopic url= tcp://localhost:7222, tcp://localhost:7222 h2. JBoss Configuration The steps in this section outline the steps required to configure JBoss to connect withTibcoEMS. h3. Step1 Add TIBCO EMS and the TIBCO EMS adapter class for JBoss to the CLASSPATH of the JBoss server. There are two options to accomplish this: h4. Option1 Add the following lines under the &lt;server&gt; element in the file $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/conf/jboss-service.xml: &lt;!-- TIBCO Enterprise Message Service classpath --&gt; &lt;classpath codebase="file:/C:\tibco\ems\5.1\lib" archives="tibjms.jar" &gt;&lt;/classpath&gt; h4. Option2 Copy tibjms.jar file to: $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/lib h3. Step2 Create a new datasource file called tibco-jms-ds.xml or whatever name you prefer, and place it in: $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/deploy And add the following contents to the file mentioned above: &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;connection-factories&gt; &lt;!-- The Tibco JMS provider loader --&gt; &lt;mbean code="org.jboss.jms.jndi.JMSProviderLoader" name=":service=JMSProviderLoader,name=TibjmsProvider"&gt;       &lt;attribute name="ProviderName"&gt;TIBCOJMSProvider&lt;/attribute&gt;       &lt;attribute name="ProviderAdapterClass"&gt;org.jboss.jms.jndi.JNDIProviderAdapter&lt;/attribute&gt;       &lt;attribute name="QueueFactoryRef"&gt;TIBXAQueueConnectionFactory&lt;/attribute&gt;       &lt;attribute name="TopicFactoryRef"&gt;TIBXATopicConnectionFactory&lt;/attribute&gt;       &lt;attribute name="Properties"&gt;                 java.naming.security.principal=admin                 java.naming.security.credentials=admin                 java.naming.factory.initial=com.tibco.tibjms.naming.TibjmsInitialContextFactory                 java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=com.tibco.tibjms.naming                 java.naming.provider.url=tcp://localhost:7222       &lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/mbean&gt; &lt;!-- JMS XA Resource adapter, use this to get transacted JMS in beans --&gt; &lt;tx-connection-factory&gt;      &lt;jndi-name&gt;TibcoXA&lt;/jndi-name&gt;      &lt;xa-transaction/&gt;      &lt;rar-name&gt;jms-ra.rar&lt;/rar-name&gt;      &lt;connection-definition&gt;org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.JmsConnectionFactory&lt;/connection-definition&gt;      &lt;config-property name="SessionDefaultType" type="java.lang.String"&gt;javax.jms.Queue&lt;/config-property&gt;      &lt;config-property name="JmsProviderAdapterJNDI" type="java.lang.String"&gt;java:/TIBCOJMSProvider&lt;/config-property&gt;      &lt;max-pool-size&gt;20&lt;/max-pool-size&gt;      &lt;security-domain-and-application&gt;TibcoXARealm&lt;/security-domain-and-application&gt; &lt;/tx-connection-factory&gt; &lt;/connection-factories&gt; h3. Step3 Notice that a security domain reference is present in the tibco-jms-ds.xml file. Therefore, modify the file $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/conf/login-config.xml file as follows and add the TibcoXARealm within the &lt;properties&gt; element: &lt;application-policy name="TibcoXARealm"&gt;   &lt;authentication&gt;       &lt;login-module code="org.jboss.resource.security.ConfiguredIdentityLoginModule" flag="required"&gt;         &lt;module-option name="principal"&gt;admin&lt;/module-option&gt;         &lt;module-option name="userName"&gt;admin&lt;/module-option&gt;         &lt;module-option name="password"&gt;admin&lt;/module-option&gt;         &lt;module-option name="managedConnectionFactoryName"&gt;jboss.jca:service=TxCM,name=TibcoXA&lt;/module-option&gt;       &lt;/login-module&gt;     &lt;/authentication&gt; &lt;/application-policy&gt; h3. Step4 When the JBoss server invokes JNDI and encounters the tibjmsnaming scheme, the server must be able to find the TIBCO Enterprise Message Service URLConnectionFactory. Therefore, modify the file $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/conf/jndi.properties as follows: Change: java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces To java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces:com.tibco.tibjms.naming h2. When Using a Client h3. Step1 When the client program invokes JNDI, it should use the TIBCO Enterprise Message Service JNDI server. Modify %JBOSS_CLIENT%\jndi.properties to use TIBCO Enterprise Message Service JNDI by setting the following property:    java.naming.factory.initial=com.tibco.tibjms.naming.TibjmsInitialContextFactory h3. Step2 Add EMS_HOME\lib\tibjms.jar to the CLASSPATH of the client program. h2. MDB configuration The sample mdb code from can be used: http://community.jboss.org/wiki/IntegrationWithTibcoEMS IntegrationWithTibcoEMS Update your jboss.xml file to look as follows: &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;jboss&gt;    &lt;resource-managers&gt;      &lt;resource-manager&gt;               &lt;res-name&gt;queuefactoryref&lt;/res-name&gt;        &lt;res-jndi-name&gt;java:/TibcoXA&lt;/res-jndi-name&gt;      &lt;/resource-manager&gt;    &lt;/resource-managers&gt;    &lt;enterprise-beans&gt;      &lt;message-driven&gt;        &lt;ejb-name&gt;SampleMDB&lt;/ejb-name&gt;        &lt;configuration-name&gt;Tibco Message Driven Bean&lt;/configuration-name&gt;        &lt;destination-jndi-name&gt;queue/myTestQueue&lt;/destination-jndi-name&gt;        &lt;mdb-user&gt;admin&lt;/mdb-user&gt;        &lt;mdb-passwd&gt;admin&lt;/mdb-passwd&gt;        &lt;resource-ref&gt;          &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jms/QCF&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;          &lt;resource-name&gt;queuefactoryref&lt;/resource-name&gt;        &lt;/resource-ref&gt;      &lt;/message-driven&gt;    &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt;    &lt;!-- container configuration for Tibco EMS --&gt;    &lt;container-configurations&gt;      &lt;container-configuration extends="Standard Message Driven Bean"&gt;        &lt;container-name&gt;Tibco Message Driven Bean&lt;/container-name&gt;        &lt;invoker-proxy-binding-name&gt;tibco-message-driven-bean&lt;/invoker-proxy-binding-name&gt;      &lt;/container-configuration&gt;    &lt;/container-configurations&gt;    &lt;!-- The JmsProviderAdapterJNDI must match the ProviderName in SERVER_HOME/deploy/tibco-jms-ds.xml file. --&gt;       &lt;invoker-proxy-bindings&gt;      &lt;invoker-proxy-binding&gt;        &lt;name&gt;tibco-message-driven-bean&lt;/name&gt;        &lt;invoker-mbean&gt;default&lt;/invoker-mbean&gt;        &lt;proxy-factory&gt;org.jboss.ejb.plugins.jms.JMSContainerInvoker&lt;/proxy-factory&gt;          &lt;proxy-factory-config&gt;            &lt;JMSProviderAdapterJNDI&gt;TIBCOJMSProvider&lt;/JMSProviderAdapterJNDI&gt;            &lt;ServerSessionPoolFactoryJNDI&gt;StdJMSPool&lt;/ServerSessionPoolFactoryJNDI&gt;            &lt;MinimumSize&gt;1&lt;/MinimumSize&gt;            &lt;MaximumSize&gt;15&lt;/MaximumSize&gt;            &lt;KeepAliveMillis&gt;30000&lt;/KeepAliveMillis&gt;            &lt;MaxMessages&gt;1&lt;/MaxMessages&gt;            &lt;MDBConfig&gt;              &lt;ReconnectIntervalSec&gt;10&lt;/ReconnectIntervalSec&gt;              &lt;DLQConfig&gt;                &lt;DestinationQueue&gt;queue/DLQ&lt;/DestinationQueue&gt;                &lt;MaxTimesRedelivered&gt;10&lt;/MaxTimesRedelivered&gt;                &lt;TimeToLive&gt;0&lt;/TimeToLive&gt;                &lt;DLQUser&gt;admin&lt;/DLQUser&gt;                &lt;DLQPassword&gt;admin&lt;/DLQPassword&gt;              &lt;/DLQConfig&gt;            &lt;/MDBConfig&gt;          &lt;/proxy-factory-config&gt;&lt;/proxy-factory&gt;        &lt;/invoker-proxy-binding&gt;      &lt;/invoker-proxy-bindings&gt; &lt;/jboss&gt; *Note: The above configuration uses an EJB2 configuration, for EJB3 the following annotations can be used: @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="providerAdapterJNDI", propertyValue="java:/TIBCOJMSProvider"), @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="DLQJNDIName", propertyValue="queue/DLQ"), @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="DLQUser", propertyValue="admin"), @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="DLQPassword",propertyValue="admin") *Upon a restart of the JBoss instance, you shold have a working configuration.* h3. +----------------------- Below this line added by matti.kaikkonen at teliasonera.com (mailto:matti.kaikkonen at teliasonera.com) Sept 13, 2012 --------------------------------+ h3. MDB Configuration with Automatic Reconnection If you have had a problem with your JMS clients not reconnecting after bouncing EMS or losing network connection then you want to look into this option. The problem here is that the number of times to attempt to reconnect to the JMS provider needs a new property "reconnectAttempts" and by default it is 5.  This property is available from JBoss Application 5 GA.  Prior to this version, reconnection attempts were infinite by default. In the above format it is not possible to define the reconnectAttempts. I have tested this with JBoss 5.1.0GA. Update your jboss.xml file to look as follows - replace the invoker-proxy-binding block with following. Look here (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-9352) for documentation. &lt;invoker-proxy-binding&gt;     &lt;name&gt;tibco-message-driven-bean&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;invoker-mbean&gt;default&lt;/invoker-mbean&gt;     &lt;proxy-factory&gt;org.jboss.ejb.plugins.inflow.JBossJMSMessageEndpointFactory&lt;/proxy-factory&gt;     &lt;proxy-factory-config&gt;         &lt;activation-config&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;providerAdapterJNDI&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;TIBCOJMSProvider&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;minSession&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;1&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;maxSession&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;15&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;keepAlive&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;30000&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;maxMessages&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;1&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;reconnectInterval&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;10&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;reconnectAttempts&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;1000000&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;useDLQ&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;true&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQHandler&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.inflow.dlq.GenericDLQHandler&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQJNDIName&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;queue/DLQ&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQUser&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;admin&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQPassword&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;admin&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQMaxResent&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;10&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;         &lt;/activation-config&gt;         &lt;endpoint-interceptors&gt;             &lt;interceptor&gt;org.jboss.proxy.ClientMethodInterceptor&lt;/interceptor&gt;             &lt;interceptor&gt;org.jboss.ejb.plugins.inflow.MessageEndpointInterceptor&lt;/interceptor&gt;             &lt;interceptor&gt;org.jboss.proxy.TransactionInterceptor&lt;/interceptor&gt;             &lt;interceptor&gt;org.jboss.invocation.InvokerInterceptor&lt;/interceptor&gt;         &lt;/endpoint-interceptors&gt;     &lt;/proxy-factory-config&gt; &lt;/invoker-proxy-binding&gt; h3. How to make the sample mdb code fully recover from JMS connection issues? With the above change we have taken care of the message listener part so that the onMessage works after a disconnect. But the sendReply doesn't recover without some extra code. You need to catch the JMSException when sending the reply, and first close the session and connection (look at the ejbRemove), and then reconnect again (look at setup) before retrying to send the reply message. h3. How to use a durable topic subscriber instead for the mdb? To use the sample mdb code (change also reply to destination from queue to topic) you just need to change all references to queues to topics. That's not a problem. The configuration of jboss.xml and ejb-jar.xml is the trickier part. In the jboss.xml replace &lt;resource-managers&gt; and &lt;enterprise-beans&gt; blocks with following. This is tested with JBoss 5.1.0GA. &lt;resource-managers&gt;         &lt;resource-manager&gt;                    &lt;res-name&gt;topicfactoryref&lt;/res-name&gt;             &lt;res-jndi-name&gt;java:/TibcoXA&lt;/res-jndi-name&gt;         &lt;/resource-manager&gt; &lt;/resource-managers&gt; &lt;enterprise-beans&gt;         &lt;message-driven&gt;             &lt;ejb-name&gt;SampleMDB&lt;/ejb-name&gt;             &lt;configuration-name&gt;Tibco Message Driven Bean&lt;/configuration-name&gt;             &lt;destination-jndi-name&gt;topic/B&lt;/destination-jndi-name&gt;             &lt;mdb-user&gt;admin&lt;/mdb-user&gt;             &lt;mdb-passwd&gt;admin&lt;/mdb-passwd&gt;             &lt;mdb-subscription-id&gt;SampleMDB&lt;/mdb-subscription-id&gt;             &lt;mdb-client-id&gt;123&lt;/mdb-client-id&gt;             &lt;resource-ref&gt;                 &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jms/TCF&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;                 &lt;resource-name&gt;topicfactoryref&lt;/resource-name&gt;             &lt;/resource-ref&gt;         &lt;/message-driven&gt; &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt; And the following replaces the original ejb-jar.xml. &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE ejb-jar    PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Enterprise JavaBeans 2.0//EN"    "http://java.sun.com/dtd/ejb-jar_2_0.dtd"&gt; &lt;ejb-jar&gt;     &lt;enterprise-beans&gt;         &lt;message-driven&gt;             &lt;ejb-name&gt;SampleMDB&lt;/ejb-name&gt;             &lt;ejb-class&gt;com.unisys.tibcojboss.mdb.SampleMDB&lt;/ejb-class&gt;             &lt;transaction-type&gt;Container&lt;/transaction-type&gt;             &lt;acknowledge-mode&gt;AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE&lt;/acknowledge-mode&gt;             &lt;message-driven-destination&gt;                 &lt;destination-type&gt;javax.jms.Topic&lt;/destination-type&gt;                 &lt;subscription-durability&gt;Durable&lt;/subscription-durability&gt;             &lt;/message-driven-destination&gt;             &lt;resource-ref&gt;                 &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jms/TCF&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;                 &lt;res-type&gt;javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory&lt;/res-type&gt;                 &lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;             &lt;/resource-ref&gt;         &lt;/message-driven&gt;     &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt; &lt;/ejb-jar&gt;</body>

    <body>To be more clear, you don't have to keep changing the selector. Just set one selector and let it hand out the appropriate EJBClientContext depending on the specific client criteria that you are talking about.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Calls against multiple servers from a single client</header>
    <body>Jaikiran, I can not see how handing out the appropriate EJBClientContext solves this. I believe that EJBClientContext is the cause of this problem to the static usage in SELECTOR. This is what we are currently doing using the JBOSS ejb client API to get around the multiple thread trashing SELECTOR in EJBClientContext. For each server target (Unique by credentials and host name/Port), we are creating a new ConfigBasedEJBClientContextSelector which in turn creates an EJBClientContext. When we invoke an ejb method, some invoker code in JBOSS will call requireCurrent on the EJBClientContext which will trash any SELECTOR currently set if being invoked from a separate thread. Our code is wrapping the proxy returned the InitialContext.lookup to globally lock before preceeding with an ejb call. This naturally will cause the server to become a client (Really, a very expensive server) to become single threaded. Thank you for your prompt reply.</body>

    <body>You don't have to do that. Use just 1 single selector and set it once during the lifetime of that application and let that selector then do the necessary EJBClientContext creation and handing out. I can give you an pseudocode example on how to do this, but what criteria do you use to identify a client with a destination server? I mean, I need more details about this part:</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Calls against multiple servers from a single client</header>
    <body>Hello Wolf, There is no (nor there should be and) affinity between a thread and an EJB proxy. The user can execute against an EJB proxy from ANY thread and not just the one that created it. It is at invocation time, the proper EJB context (Stored in the proxy code above) needs to be setup so that the EJBInvoker code from JBOSS sees the "right" context for THAT thread. Today, EJBContext has SELECTOR as a static so all threads will trample on each other when the code calls requireCurrent from multiple threads. I hope I answered your question. Thank you for all your help in this.</body>

    <body>I have a similar problem. My scenario is as follows: Messages are being sent from jboss-4.2.1.GA to a remote stand alone hornetq-2.2.14.Final. There is an MDB deployed on jboss-7.1.1.Final node that listens to the remote stand alone hornetq-2.2.14.Final queue. Everything seems to be working fine up to the point where there is a disconnection between jboss 7 node and hornetq. For example, when hornetq is shut down and then brought back up, jboss jboss 7 is not able to reconnect to hornetq. Jboss 4 on the other hand is able to send messages to hornetq but messages are not being consumed by MDB.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Calls against multiple servers from a single client</header>
    <body>Hi Tarek, I suppose you have knowledge with former AS versions. Throw the knowlege about ejb-clients away, it's complete different. Since AS7 the Proxy (stub) does not contain any information about the server, it is only a implementation of the Interface that is created by reflection during runtime lookup(). The Proxy knows only the name "ejb:app/module/distinct/bean!view". If you execute a method the ejb-client library decide how to go, here is the knowlege what server exists set by the initial creation or the jboss-ejb-client.properties. The selector handle the phys. connections to the servers and I'm not sure what happen in your case setting the selectors for each call, regardless that such sync-block might be a concurrency bottleneck. Le me finish my example I mentioned above and it might will give you an idea.</body>

    <body>Hi Wolf, The sync call (Labeld Evil) is used in the example above of what a multithreaded client will have to do and avoid the selector trashing and function properly albeit serially. It is not used for to demonstrate "best practices". Out multi-server test cases broke immediately in AS7 thus the hack to show the extent of this problem. I believe that the EJBClientContext with a static selector inhibits proper implementation of a multithreaded client in AS7. Tarek</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Calls against multiple servers from a single client</header>
    <body>That will not be true, it is possible to have multithread clients with AS7, but as I mentionend it is completly different in implmentation and use. So what is your exact requirement. Do you - deploy the same applcation at different servers with different credentials and need to decide which one is called? - deploy different EJBs spread on servers and want to call it? Simple, add all servers to the ejb-client.properties and call the different names Wolf</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Calls against multiple servers from a single client</header>
    <body>Hi Wolf, That is one of the use cases. This why I opened this ticket. While the framework clearly allows for multiple targets and there is nothing to inhibit a multithreaded client, I am pointing out a race condition in the implementation with respect to static in EJBContext. Again, looking at the EJBInvocationHandler, you can clearly see that it is indirectly manipulating a static member by calling the requireCurrent(). Two threads in the EJBInvocationHandler doInvoke code can end up pointing to the wrong SELECTOR.</body>

Introduction This article differs from: http://community.jboss.org/wiki/IntegrationWithTibcoEMS IntegrationWithTibcoEMS and the TibcoEMS administration documents in the following: * Does not replace and remove JBoss messaging from the JBoss Installation (JBoss messaging can still be removed, but this is optional since the DefaultJMSProvider has not been replaced) * Defines a TIBCOJMSProvider * Provides a DLQ configuration without changing standardjboss.xml and replacing the DefaultJMSProvider with TIBCOJMSProvider * Has been tested on JBoss EAP 5 * Uses authentication with Tibco EMS h2. Credits The content in this page is based on TibcoEMS documentation for JBoss4.x. Some of the content has also been borrowed from the article: http://community.jboss.org/wiki/IntegrationWithTibcoEMS IntegrationWithTibcoEMS including the sample mdb code for testing. A special thanks to Marjono Reksopuro, Susanta Mondal and Michael McKernan for their help with Tibco Administration, integration and testing for this configuration. h2. TibcoEMS Configuration The steps in this section outline the steps required to create a test queue on TibcoEMS as well as the DLQ. ** Please note this EMS configuration assumes the following:* - Authorization enabled - Username/Password are set to: admin/admin  - A single instance running locally:   localhost with port of 7222. - If you need to have FT Pairs for failover, the url should be changed from   tcp://localhost:7222, tcp://localhost:7222  to  tcp://firstmachine:firstport,tcp://secondmachine:secondport h3. Step1 Start the tibemsd server and the tibemsadmin console. Queues and Connection Factories h3. Step2 Create two queues (queue/myTestQueue and queue/DLQ) and two XA connection factories (TIBXAQueueConnectionFactory and TIBXATopicConnectionFactory), by entering the following commands in tibemsadmin:           &gt; connect     &gt; create queue queue/myTestQueue     &gt; create queue queue/DLQ     &gt; create factory TIBXAQueueConnectionFactory xaqueue url=tcp://localhost:7222     &gt; create factory TIBXATopicConnectionFactory xatopic url= tcp://localhost:7222 Tibco pairs for Failover:     &gt; create factory TIBXAQueueConnectionFactory xaqueue url=tcp://localhost:7222, tcp://localhost:7222     &gt; create factory TIBXATopicConnectionFactory xatopic url= tcp://localhost:7222, tcp://localhost:7222 h2. JBoss Configuration The steps in this section outline the steps required to configure JBoss to connect withTibcoEMS. h3. Step1 Add TIBCO EMS and the TIBCO EMS adapter class for JBoss to the CLASSPATH of the JBoss server. There are two options to accomplish this: h4. Option1 Add the following lines under the &lt;server&gt; element in the file $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/conf/jboss-service.xml: &lt;!-- TIBCO Enterprise Message Service classpath --&gt; &lt;classpath codebase="file:/C:\tibco\ems\5.1\lib" archives="tibjms.jar" &gt;&lt;/classpath&gt; h4. Option2 Copy tibjms.jar file to: $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/lib h3. Step2 Create a new datasource file called tibco-jms-ds.xml or whatever name you prefer, and place it in: $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/deploy And add the following contents to the file mentioned above: &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;connection-factories&gt; &lt;!-- The Tibco JMS provider loader --&gt; &lt;mbean code="org.jboss.jms.jndi.JMSProviderLoader" name=":service=JMSProviderLoader,name=TibjmsProvider"&gt;       &lt;attribute name="ProviderName"&gt;TIBCOJMSProvider&lt;/attribute&gt;       &lt;attribute name="ProviderAdapterClass"&gt;org.jboss.jms.jndi.JNDIProviderAdapter&lt;/attribute&gt;       &lt;attribute name="QueueFactoryRef"&gt;TIBXAQueueConnectionFactory&lt;/attribute&gt;       &lt;attribute name="TopicFactoryRef"&gt;TIBXATopicConnectionFactory&lt;/attribute&gt;       &lt;attribute name="Properties"&gt;                 java.naming.security.principal=admin                 java.naming.security.credentials=admin                 java.naming.factory.initial=com.tibco.tibjms.naming.TibjmsInitialContextFactory                 java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=com.tibco.tibjms.naming                 java.naming.provider.url=tcp://localhost:7222       &lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/mbean&gt; &lt;!-- JMS XA Resource adapter, use this to get transacted JMS in beans --&gt; &lt;tx-connection-factory&gt;      &lt;jndi-name&gt;TibcoXA&lt;/jndi-name&gt;      &lt;xa-transaction/&gt;      &lt;rar-name&gt;jms-ra.rar&lt;/rar-name&gt;      &lt;connection-definition&gt;org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.JmsConnectionFactory&lt;/connection-definition&gt;      &lt;config-property name="SessionDefaultType" type="java.lang.String"&gt;javax.jms.Queue&lt;/config-property&gt;      &lt;config-property name="JmsProviderAdapterJNDI" type="java.lang.String"&gt;java:/TIBCOJMSProvider&lt;/config-property&gt;      &lt;max-pool-size&gt;20&lt;/max-pool-size&gt;      &lt;security-domain-and-application&gt;TibcoXARealm&lt;/security-domain-and-application&gt; &lt;/tx-connection-factory&gt; &lt;/connection-factories&gt; h3. Step3 Notice that a security domain reference is present in the tibco-jms-ds.xml file. Therefore, modify the file $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/conf/login-config.xml file as follows and add the TibcoXARealm within the &lt;properties&gt; element: &lt;application-policy name="TibcoXARealm"&gt;   &lt;authentication&gt;       &lt;login-module code="org.jboss.resource.security.ConfiguredIdentityLoginModule" flag="required"&gt;         &lt;module-option name="principal"&gt;admin&lt;/module-option&gt;         &lt;module-option name="userName"&gt;admin&lt;/module-option&gt;         &lt;module-option name="password"&gt;admin&lt;/module-option&gt;         &lt;module-option name="managedConnectionFactoryName"&gt;jboss.jca:service=TxCM,name=TibcoXA&lt;/module-option&gt;       &lt;/login-module&gt;     &lt;/authentication&gt; &lt;/application-policy&gt; h3. Step4 When the JBoss server invokes JNDI and encounters the tibjmsnaming scheme, the server must be able to find the TIBCO Enterprise Message Service URLConnectionFactory. Therefore, modify the file $JBOSS_HOME/jboss-as/server/myinstance/conf/jndi.properties as follows: Change: java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces To java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces:com.tibco.tibjms.naming h2. When Using a Client h3. Step1 When the client program invokes JNDI, it should use the TIBCO Enterprise Message Service JNDI server. Modify %JBOSS_CLIENT%\jndi.properties to use TIBCO Enterprise Message Service JNDI by setting the following property:    java.naming.factory.initial=com.tibco.tibjms.naming.TibjmsInitialContextFactory h3. Step2 Add EMS_HOME\lib\tibjms.jar to the CLASSPATH of the client program. h2. MDB configuration The sample mdb code from can be used: http://community.jboss.org/wiki/IntegrationWithTibcoEMS IntegrationWithTibcoEMS Update your jboss.xml file to look as follows: &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;jboss&gt;    &lt;resource-managers&gt;      &lt;resource-manager&gt;               &lt;res-name&gt;queuefactoryref&lt;/res-name&gt;        &lt;res-jndi-name&gt;java:/TibcoXA&lt;/res-jndi-name&gt;      &lt;/resource-manager&gt;    &lt;/resource-managers&gt;    &lt;enterprise-beans&gt;      &lt;message-driven&gt;        &lt;ejb-name&gt;SampleMDB&lt;/ejb-name&gt;        &lt;configuration-name&gt;Tibco Message Driven Bean&lt;/configuration-name&gt;        &lt;destination-jndi-name&gt;queue/myTestQueue&lt;/destination-jndi-name&gt;        &lt;mdb-user&gt;admin&lt;/mdb-user&gt;        &lt;mdb-passwd&gt;admin&lt;/mdb-passwd&gt;        &lt;resource-ref&gt;          &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jms/QCF&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;          &lt;resource-name&gt;queuefactoryref&lt;/resource-name&gt;        &lt;/resource-ref&gt;      &lt;/message-driven&gt;    &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt;    &lt;!-- container configuration for Tibco EMS --&gt;    &lt;container-configurations&gt;      &lt;container-configuration extends="Standard Message Driven Bean"&gt;        &lt;container-name&gt;Tibco Message Driven Bean&lt;/container-name&gt;        &lt;invoker-proxy-binding-name&gt;tibco-message-driven-bean&lt;/invoker-proxy-binding-name&gt;      &lt;/container-configuration&gt;    &lt;/container-configurations&gt;    &lt;!-- The JmsProviderAdapterJNDI must match the ProviderName in SERVER_HOME/deploy/tibco-jms-ds.xml file. --&gt;       &lt;invoker-proxy-bindings&gt;      &lt;invoker-proxy-binding&gt;        &lt;name&gt;tibco-message-driven-bean&lt;/name&gt;        &lt;invoker-mbean&gt;default&lt;/invoker-mbean&gt;        &lt;proxy-factory&gt;org.jboss.ejb.plugins.jms.JMSContainerInvoker&lt;/proxy-factory&gt;          &lt;proxy-factory-config&gt;            &lt;JMSProviderAdapterJNDI&gt;TIBCOJMSProvider&lt;/JMSProviderAdapterJNDI&gt;            &lt;ServerSessionPoolFactoryJNDI&gt;StdJMSPool&lt;/ServerSessionPoolFactoryJNDI&gt;            &lt;MinimumSize&gt;1&lt;/MinimumSize&gt;            &lt;MaximumSize&gt;15&lt;/MaximumSize&gt;            &lt;KeepAliveMillis&gt;30000&lt;/KeepAliveMillis&gt;            &lt;MaxMessages&gt;1&lt;/MaxMessages&gt;            &lt;MDBConfig&gt;              &lt;ReconnectIntervalSec&gt;10&lt;/ReconnectIntervalSec&gt;              &lt;DLQConfig&gt;                &lt;DestinationQueue&gt;queue/DLQ&lt;/DestinationQueue&gt;                &lt;MaxTimesRedelivered&gt;10&lt;/MaxTimesRedelivered&gt;                &lt;TimeToLive&gt;0&lt;/TimeToLive&gt;                &lt;DLQUser&gt;admin&lt;/DLQUser&gt;                &lt;DLQPassword&gt;admin&lt;/DLQPassword&gt;              &lt;/DLQConfig&gt;            &lt;/MDBConfig&gt;          &lt;/proxy-factory-config&gt;&lt;/proxy-factory&gt;        &lt;/invoker-proxy-binding&gt;      &lt;/invoker-proxy-bindings&gt; &lt;/jboss&gt; *Note: The above configuration uses an EJB2 configuration, for EJB3 the following annotations can be used: @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="providerAdapterJNDI", propertyValue="java:/TIBCOJMSProvider"), @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="DLQJNDIName", propertyValue="queue/DLQ"), @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="DLQUser", propertyValue="admin"), @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="DLQPassword",propertyValue="admin") *Upon a restart of the JBoss instance, you shold have a working configuration.* +----------------------- Below this line added by matti.kaikkonen at teliasonera.com (mailto:matti.kaikkonen at teliasonera.com) Sept 13, 2012 --------------------------------+ h3. MDB Configuration with Automatic Reconnection If you have had a problem with your JMS clients not reconnecting after bouncing EMS or losing network connection then you want to look into this option. The problem here is that the number of times to attempt to reconnect to the JMS provider needs a new property "reconnectAttempts" and by default it is 5.  This property is available from JBoss Application 5 GA.  Prior to this version, reconnection attempts were infinite by default. In the above format it is not possible to define the reconnectAttempts. I have tested this with JBoss 5.1.0GA. Update your jboss.xml file to look as follows - replace the invoker-proxy-binding block with following. Look here (https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-9352) for documentation. &lt;invoker-proxy-binding&gt;     &lt;name&gt;tibco-message-driven-bean&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;invoker-mbean&gt;default&lt;/invoker-mbean&gt;     &lt;proxy-factory&gt;org.jboss.ejb.plugins.inflow.JBossJMSMessageEndpointFactory&lt;/proxy-factory&gt;     &lt;proxy-factory-config&gt;         &lt;activation-config&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;providerAdapterJNDI&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;TIBCOJMSProvider&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;minSession&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;1&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;maxSession&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;15&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;keepAlive&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;30000&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;maxMessages&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;1&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;reconnectInterval&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;10&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;reconnectAttempts&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;1000000&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;useDLQ&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;true&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQHandler&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.inflow.dlq.GenericDLQHandler&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQJNDIName&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;queue/DLQ&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQUser&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;admin&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQPassword&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;admin&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;             &lt;activation-config-property&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;DLQMaxResent&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;                 &lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;10&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;             &lt;/activation-config-property&gt;         &lt;/activation-config&gt;         &lt;endpoint-interceptors&gt;             &lt;interceptor&gt;org.jboss.proxy.ClientMethodInterceptor&lt;/interceptor&gt;             &lt;interceptor&gt;org.jboss.ejb.plugins.inflow.MessageEndpointInterceptor&lt;/interceptor&gt;             &lt;interceptor&gt;org.jboss.proxy.TransactionInterceptor&lt;/interceptor&gt;             &lt;interceptor&gt;org.jboss.invocation.InvokerInterceptor&lt;/interceptor&gt;         &lt;/endpoint-interceptors&gt;     &lt;/proxy-factory-config&gt; &lt;/invoker-proxy-binding&gt; h3. How to make the sample mdb code fully recover from JMS connection issues? With the above change we have taken care of the message listener part so that the onMessage works after a disconnect. But the sendReply doesn't recover without some extra code. You need to catch the JMSException when sending the reply, and first close the session and connection (look at the ejbRemove), and then reconnect again (look at setup) before retrying to send the reply message. h3. How to test your implementation for automatic reconnection/recovery from JMS connection issues? h4. Option1 If you don't have access to a TIBCO EMS server that you can bounce or kill anytime then here is one possible way to test it. The idea is to manipulate the routing table of the linux or windows workstation where you run your JBoss and in that way simulate a loss of connectivity. Here are examples that I have used. *Linux:* if the ip address of the TIBCO EMS server is 192.168.1.38 then Simulate network issue *route add -net 192.168.1.38 netmask 255.255.255.255 reject* Recover connectivity* * *route del -net 192.168.1.38 netmask 255.255.255.255 reject* This works also - in my case eth0 device is connected and eth1 is WLAN that is disconnected *route add -net 192.168.1.38 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1* *Windows7**:* if the ip address of the TIBCO EMS server is 192.168.1.38 then Simulate network issue *route ADD 192.168.1.38 MASK 255.255.255.255 169.254.138.21               * # where 169.254.138.21 is my VMware Network Adapter Autoconfiguration address * * Recover connectivity* * *route DELETE 192.168.1.38* h4. Option2 If you can bounce or kill TIBCO EMS then either do a clean shutdown (CTRL-C in the EMS console does that) or use kill -9 / Task Manager&gt;End Process to simulate a crash. h3. How to use a durable topic subscriber instead for the mdb? To use the sample mdb code (change also reply to destination from queue to topic) you just need to change all references to queues to topics. That's not a problem. The configuration of jboss.xml and ejb-jar.xml is the trickier part. In the jboss.xml replace &lt;resource-managers&gt; and &lt;enterprise-beans&gt; blocks with following. This is tested with JBoss 5.1.0GA. &lt;resource-managers&gt;         &lt;resource-manager&gt;                    &lt;res-name&gt;topicfactoryref&lt;/res-name&gt;             &lt;res-jndi-name&gt;java:/TibcoXA&lt;/res-jndi-name&gt;         &lt;/resource-manager&gt; &lt;/resource-managers&gt; &lt;enterprise-beans&gt;         &lt;message-driven&gt;             &lt;ejb-name&gt;SampleMDB&lt;/ejb-name&gt;             &lt;configuration-name&gt;Tibco Message Driven Bean&lt;/configuration-name&gt;             &lt;destination-jndi-name&gt;topic/B&lt;/destination-jndi-name&gt;             &lt;mdb-user&gt;admin&lt;/mdb-user&gt;             &lt;mdb-passwd&gt;admin&lt;/mdb-passwd&gt;             &lt;mdb-subscription-id&gt;SampleMDB&lt;/mdb-subscription-id&gt;             &lt;mdb-client-id&gt;123&lt;/mdb-client-id&gt;             &lt;resource-ref&gt;                 &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jms/TCF&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;                 &lt;resource-name&gt;topicfactoryref&lt;/resource-name&gt;             &lt;/resource-ref&gt;         &lt;/message-driven&gt; &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt; And the following replaces the original ejb-jar.xml. &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE ejb-jar    PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Enterprise JavaBeans 2.0//EN"    "http://java.sun.com/dtd/ejb-jar_2_0.dtd"&gt; &lt;ejb-jar&gt;     &lt;enterprise-beans&gt;         &lt;message-driven&gt;             &lt;ejb-name&gt;SampleMDB&lt;/ejb-name&gt;             &lt;ejb-class&gt;com.unisys.tibcojboss.mdb.SampleMDB&lt;/ejb-class&gt;             &lt;transaction-type&gt;Container&lt;/transaction-type&gt;             &lt;acknowledge-mode&gt;AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE&lt;/acknowledge-mode&gt;             &lt;message-driven-destination&gt;                 &lt;destination-type&gt;javax.jms.Topic&lt;/destination-type&gt;                 &lt;subscription-durability&gt;Durable&lt;/subscription-durability&gt;             &lt;/message-driven-destination&gt;             &lt;resource-ref&gt;                 &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jms/TCF&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;                 &lt;res-type&gt;javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory&lt;/res-type&gt;                 &lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;             &lt;/resource-ref&gt;         &lt;/message-driven&gt;     &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt; &lt;/ejb-jar&gt;</body>

    <body>Hi, Example :     &lt;system-properties&gt;     &lt;/system-properties&gt; Sure I can do the work on my code but I don't want to reference jboss system property :     &lt;system-properties&gt;         &lt;property name="my.image.dir" value="image"/&gt;     &lt;/system-properties&gt;   If we use StringPropertyReplacer we can also do sometthing like :     &lt;system-properties&gt;         &lt;property name="my.dir" value="/my/dir"/&gt;     &lt;/system-properties&gt; The basic idea is to check if the added/removed/changed system property resolve expression :   # my.image.dir = /opt/jboss/image The resolved expression will not be stored on the standalone.xml/domain.xml file.

    <body>Hi, I sometimes modify data directly in the database and I want to clear the Hibernate second level cache (Infinispan) to reflect that change. I've created a MXBean to do that but wouldn't it be nice if we can do that directly from the AS7 console (jboss-cli, web) ? The clear action must be available at CacheContainer level (ie clear all caches) and at cache level and take care of clustered caches. Do you think this is a good idea ? If so how can I help ?

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final custom login module for remoting and custom principal</header>
    <body>I have exactly the same issue with JBoss 7.1.1. For the ClassCastException itself, I do not have a solution, but I have a workaround which works until I have a clean and staight solution. When retrieving the principal via @Resource ... I check the name of the instantiated class via principal.getClass().getName(). equals(MyExpectedPrincipalClass.class.getName()) to assure the correct implementation and to avoid later exceptions. Then I work with reflection to access fields and method via getMethod() and getField(). It works fine, but it is quite ugly. Does anyone have a better idea?</body>

    <body>Solution for me was, login modul is deployed as jboss modul. No packages from my login module are included in any deployments!. my login modul is defined in standalone.xml as global, so any class loaders can find it. I still had to add my login modul as dependency to some othe jboss provided modules...  you see while testing which modul get problems, so you add your login modul to this modul as dependecy...</body>

    <body>Thanks Wolf-Dieter et Nicklas, Finally find out the probleme. It has nothing to do with Ejb, neither Hibernate, but classloading I think. My probleme is *I have a parent DAO  which was placed in a module*    @PersistenceContext    // some basic functions... *Then other DAO extends the parent DAO and they are placed in deployment* @Stateless    // other dao functions using em from parentDAO... After I move the ParentDAO project out to deployment from the module, it works. I cannot really figurer out why but I think its the classloading probleme.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: EJB bean is not working in Multi threading of JBoss 7.1.1 Final</header>
    <body>As this is the normal behaviour of the client. The 'lookup' will never call the server! So you get an exception if you access the bean. For examples you might have a look into the quickstarts (or clone/download it) : git clone git://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-quickstart.git ejb-remote, cluster-ha-singleton-service and ejb-multi-server contain clients that will use what you will see. See the description and documentation  https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Contributing+a+Quickstart here, also each quickstart will have a README.md</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - Re: Security Context	Propagation</header>
    <body>PicketBox already works with sessions to use different stores: local-inmemory or in-memory distributable cache. Your proposal can work with what we already have. The PicketBoxSubject and PicketBoxSession work very similar to the SecurityContext. But I agree that is better to have a specific class for that. Maybe we can have something like: PicketBoxSubject.propagate(). Where this method is responsible to create a SC instance by using some factory or something (let developers code their own SC) and to know how to propagate it. Basically, your logic would be inside the PicketBoxSubject.propagate() method.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Re: NPE when initiating StatefulKnowledgeSession</header>
    <body>Figured out now: I was using hibernate 4.x instead of 3.x My follow-up question on this would be - how do I know which versions of libraries to choose in my maven configuration for JBPM? It does not seem to be in the specifications.. May be it can be done automatically through maven "parent" feature? That's a general question in regards to all libraries used.. Thanks!</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - Re: Security Context	Propagation</header>
    <body>The more I have experienced issues in this area the more convinced I am that PicketBox or any related security subsystem should not be responsible for managing the actual association of the current security context with the current request. What I mean by this is that the security subsystem / PicketBox is not aware of the underlying threading model of the subsystem currently handling the request - in the past we had one thread per request so have been able to make assumptions about this but that is not the case anymore. I am not sure what it would look like yet but I have been thinking we need something along the lines of an API that allows for items to be attached to the current request the different subsystems / containers would then provide implementations of that API and the container will then make the decision regarding how to actually perform the association. As then raised above there needs to be a mechanism to propagate between different containers - that may be a point where a ThreadLocal may be required and leave the container receiving the request responsible for taking care of it before it switches the request to a new thread.</body>

    <body>PicketBox cannot be the all encompassing security project as many demand.  :) As you said, Darran, there are cases where the integrating application/subsystem has to manage aspects of security itself while using the constructs in PBox.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - __redirected.__DocumentBuilderFactory ClassCastException</header>
    <body>Hello everyone, I am migrating some web systems that use third party libraries. One of them use its own DocumentBuilderFactory class. I created a module for the libraries, and the classes in that module are being accessed fine by the applications. When I try to use DocumentBuilderFactory it gives a classCastException. I tryed to exclude DocumentBuilderFactory from javaee.api with both ways indicated at this post   https://community.jboss.org/message/637818#637818#637818 https://community.jboss.org/message/637818#637818. Neither worked and I still keep recieving the error: java.lang.ClassCastException: __redirected.__DocumentBuilderFactory cannot be cast to javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory Is it because __redirected.__DocumentBuilderFactory is not on javax.xml.parsers? so I guess the configuration to exclude &lt;exclude path="javax/xml/parsers" /&gt; would not work, right? If so, how can I resolve this issue? Where is __redirect.__DocumentBuilderFactory? Why is Jboss trying to use it instead of my own class. Thanks in advance and follows the 2 configurations I had tryed according to the answer in that post: (I also tryed many variations trying to exclude javax/xml/parsers from javaee.api) &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;jboss-deployment-structure xmlns="urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.1"&gt;     &lt;ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;true&lt;/ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;     &lt;deployment&gt;         &lt;dependencies&gt;             &lt;module name="deployment.javaee.api" /&gt;         &lt;/dependencies&gt;         &lt;exclusions&gt;             &lt;module name="javaee.api" /&gt;         &lt;/exclusions&gt;     &lt;/deployment&gt;     &lt;module name="deployment.javaee.api"&gt;         &lt;dependencies&gt;             &lt;module name="javaee.api" export="true"&gt;                 &lt;imports&gt;                     &lt;exclude path="javax/xml/parsers" /&gt;                 &lt;/imports&gt;             &lt;/module&gt;         &lt;/dependencies&gt;     &lt;/module&gt; &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt; *or* &lt;jboss-deployment-structure xmlns="urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.1"&gt;   &lt;deployment&gt;     &lt;exclusions&gt;       &lt;module name="javaee.api" /&gt;     &lt;/exclusions&gt;     &lt;dependencies&gt;         &lt;module name="org.apache.commons.logging" /&gt;     &lt;/dependencies&gt;   &lt;/deployment&gt;   &lt;sub-deployment name="viabilidade.war"&gt;     &lt;exclusions&gt;       &lt;module name="javaee.api" /&gt;     &lt;/exclusions&gt;        &lt;dependencies&gt;         &lt;module name="javaee.api" &gt;             &lt;imports&gt;                 &lt;exclude-set&gt;                     &lt;path name="javax/xml/parsers"/&gt;                 &lt;/exclude-set&gt;             &lt;/imports&gt;         &lt;/module&gt;     &lt;/dependencies&gt;   &lt;/sub-deployment&gt; &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt;</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [EJB3 Development] - Help with	Java+Netbeans+JBoss+JMS+EJBs</header>
    <body>Hello, I am working on converting a two-tier Java desktop application to a three-tier application.  This is a desktop application and uses the Swing Application Framork (SAF) as its UI.  This is NOT a web application. It does not and is not intended to run inside a browser. Because of the SAF dependency, I am limited to NetBeans 7.0.1.Because of a dependency on DCM4CHE (a back-end medical picture archiving service), I am dependent on JBoss 4.2.3 and MySQL 5.1 (although we have recently successfully moved to MySQL 5.5 and we're in teh process of moving to JBoss 5 and, I hope, JBoss 6). I am looking for a COMPLETE example of how to create a Java application that is built in NetBeans and communicates with queues on a JBoss server using JMS.  The otherwise excellent HornetQ examples all have Ant scripts but run independently and I did not understand how to integrate any of that code into my NetBeans application.  NetBeans gives some examples on using JMS, but they target the GlassFish server.  I haven't yet located a complete, end-to-end, enterprise application that is pure Java - i.e., no web pages. Can anyone help with links, suggestions, etc.  And, I know SAF is a dead-end; moving to the NetBeans 7.1 platform or JavaFX is another project.  Right now, I just have to concentrate on moving all the database code to the server and figure out how to create a messaging system between the Java/Swing client and the JBoss-hosted JMS queues, MDB and EJBs.  Thanks in advance!</body>

    <body>JBoss Tools is a large conglomerate of plugins and components from many different locations. This page will help committers and hackers navigate the process of setting up a development environment, contribute patches, and navigate any approval processes required. *Development Environment* The first thing any developers will want to know is &lt;a href=" https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18124 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossToolsDevelopmentEnvironment"&gt;How to set up your development environment&lt;/a&gt;. This involves choosing which eclipse you'll want to install, your choices of java, subversion, eclipse target platform, which parts of the svn tree to checkout, and how to run tests from inside your IDE. *Building JBoss Tools * Not all contributors will want to go through the trouble, but, if you really want to make sure your changes work the same in PDE's runtime environment (inside eclipse) as they do from a tycho build, which is the build system we use, you'll also want to try to build your project via the command line. You'll be able to set up your first builds by reading &lt;a href=" https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16604 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HowToBuildJBossToolsWithMaven3"&gt;How to Build JBoss Tools with Maven 3&lt;/a&gt;. All committers are expected to build their component locally and verify the tests still pass before committing any major patches. Sometimes, running your test suite in PDE vs in Tycho (command line build) have different results in the test suite. This is unfortunate, but it *does* happen. If you're getting inconsistant results, and really need to figure out what's going wrong, you'll want to read about &lt;a href=" https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15209 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/RemoteDebuggingForEclipseTestPlug-inRunningByTycho"&gt;Using Eclipse for Remote Debugging Tycho Builds&lt;/a&gt;. *Submitting / Committing patches* All commits should reference a jira. All committers are required to have a jira target in every svn commit message. This helps keep our history easy to trace back through when searching for regressions. This helps keep us aware of what use cases caused the regression, and what to look out for and re-test when reverting or re-fixing an issue. Without a jira reference, if "fixing" one regression might create a new one, we'll have no way to find out why the change was committed in the first place, or what the change thought it was fixing. In general, the process for submitting / committing a patch is: 1) Open a jira describing the bug 2) Attach the patch to the jira. 3) If you are a core developer,       a) simply commit the patch. Otherwise,       b) assign the issue to the component lead asking for approval and assistence in committing. 4) Resolve the issue as "done". Make sure to target the fix version accurately. Try to make sure your description, or at least a closing comment, reference exactly how to replicate the issue, so that QE can verify that the issue is fixed.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Adding a Plugin (and/or Feature) To An Existing Component</header>
    <body>+First, read this document on how to build JBoss Tools components locally:  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16604 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HowtoBuildJBossToolswithMaven3+ | *+Before adding a complete new feature to JBoss Tools announce the addition on  jbosstools-dev &lt;jbosstools-dev at lists.jboss.org &gt;  with reasons WHY+* *+a new feature is needed and what new (if any) dependencies it will bring in. New dependencies need to be added to the target platforms, and thus should be reported in JIRA for tracking and task assignment purposes.+* *+Note too that new features will often start in+ JBoss Tools +but NOT be included in+ JBoss Developer Studio +until they have had time to mature. If your new feature needs to be in both offerings, please be sure to explain WHY when contacting the above mailing list.+* | h2. Adding a new plugin or feature to JBoss Tools Now that you can build your component, you can easily add a new plugin to that component. Here's how. 0. Make sure your new plugin compiles in your workspace. Ensure your MANIFEST.MF contains all references/includes/requirements you need. Be sure to set the correct Bundle-RequireExecutionEnvironment (eg., JDK5 or JDK6). 1. When you are satisfied, you can commit your new plugin project to SVN. cd ~/trunk/as/plugins; \ svn add org.jboss.ide.eclipse.as.rse.core; \ svn ci -m "JBIDE-123456 Initial commit of new as.rse.core plugin" org.jboss.ide.eclipse.as.rse.core 2. Next, add a pom.xml file to the root of your new project. You can use m2eclipse to help w/ this if you have it installed; otherwise copy from another existing plugin project and edit appropriately. The version of the pom should match the version in the manifest.mf. Note that 3.2.0.qualifier (in MANIFEST.MF) is equivalent to 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT in the pom.xml. 3. Build your plugin: cd ~/trunk/as/plugins/org.jboss.ide.eclipse.as.rse.core; \ mvn3 clean install 4. If your component's new plugin builds successfully, you can commit the pom.xml file, and add a reference to the new plugin (module) in the container pom: vi ~/trunk/as/plugins/pom.xml 5. To ensure that your plugin is available on the update site, be sure that it is contained in at least one feature's feature.xml. vi ~/trunk/as/features/org.jboss.ide.eclipse.as.feature/feature.xml 6. If necessary, create a new feature to contain the new plugin - easiest approach is to copy an existing feature project, and string-replace the various files until it suits your needs. Don't forget to update .project and other hidden files. svn add org.jboss.ide.eclipse.as.new.feature; \ svn ci -m "JBIDE-123456 Initial commit of new as.new feature" org.jboss.ide.eclipse.as.new.feature 7. If your component's new feature builds successfully, you can commit the pom.xml file, and add a reference to the new plugin (module) in the container pom: vi ~/trunk/as/features/pom.xml h3. Verifying your new feature/plugin can be built and installed: 8. Next, ensure that the feature appears in all appropriate JBoss Tools update sites: vi ~/trunk/as/site/category.xml # (the component's update site) + + +     and one of the following+ vi ~/trunk/build/aggregate/site/site.xml # (the JBoss Tools aggregate update site) vi ~/trunk/build/aggregate/coretests-site/site.xml # (the JBoss Tools aggregate update site for test plugins) + + +     or one of these two sites:+ vi ~/trunk/build/aggregate/soa-site/site/site.xml # (the JBoss Tools aggregate update site for SOA Tooling) vi ~/trunk/build/aggregate/soatests-site/site/site.xml # (the JBoss Tools aggregate update site for SOA Tooling test plugins) +   Note: for *AS, and any DEPENDENCIES of AS,* you MAY want to add your new feature to this site too, if and only if astools makes use of that plugin / feature:+ vi ~/trunk/build/aggregate/webtools-site/site.xml # (the JBoss Tools aggregate update site for WTP adapters) 9. Finally, build the sites locally to ensure the XML is valid and the contents appear correctly. You can then install the new feature from the sites into Eclipse or JBDS to verify it runs as expected (no missing dependencies which prevent the plugin from being activated, no missing metadata such as description, provider, license or copyright while installing, etc.) cd ~/trunk/as/; mvn clean install; # then point Eclipse at ~/trunk/as/site/target/repository/ +     and+ cd ~/trunk/build/aggregate/site; mvn clean install; # then point Eclipse at ~/trunk/build/aggregate/site/target/site/ h2. h2. Adding a new plugin or feature to JBoss Developer Studio 10. Next, ensure that the feature appears in all appropriate JBoss Developer Studio update site: vi ~/devstudio/trunk/product/site/site.xml # (the JBoss Developer Studio aggregate update site) vi ~/devstudio/trunk/product-soa/site/site.xml # (the JBoss Developer Studio aggregate update site for SOA Tooling) 11. If you added a new feature, be sure that the feature is included in the JBDS feature (or wrapped inside another feature) so that it will appear in the installer. vi ~/devstudio/trunk/product/features/com.jboss.jbds.product.feature/feature.xml h3. h3. Verifying your new feature/plugin can be built and installed: 12. Finally, build the sites locally to ensure the XML is valid and the contents appear correctly. You can then install the new feature from the sites into Eclipse or JBDS to verify it runs as expected (no missing dependencies which prevent the plugin from being activated, no missing metadata such as description, provider, license or copyright while installing, etc.) *  * cd ~/devstudio/trunk/product; mvn clean install -f pom-site-and-product.xml; # then point JBDS at        # ~/devstudio/trunk/product/features/com.jboss.jbds/target/repository/ (search for "Branded Product" feature, *com.jboss.jbds.all*)* +     or+ cd ~/devstudio/trunk/product-soa; mvn clean install; # then point JBDS at ~/devstudio/trunk/product-soa/site/target/site/ +* - The product site in ~/devstudio/trunk/product/site/target/site/ does not contain the "Branded Product" feature, *com.jboss.jbds.all*, so you cannot use that site to update an existing JBDS install, only an Eclipse install.+</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Approval Process for Adding A Plugin and or Feature To An Existing Component</header>
    <body>Adding a plugin or feature to an existing component requires some level of consensus on why the plugin is needed. In general, the component lead will be given plenty of space to manage their plugins as they wish, however, many plugins have been poorly defined in the past, leading to entire features or plugins holding only a few classes that could easily be stored in a new package of an existing plugin. When requesting approval for a new plugin, please fill out the following template and paste it into the appropriate jira: *Request Template* * * 1) Explain the scope of the new plugin. This scope will be binding throughout the life of the plugin.  (ex: a plugin for integration of plugin X and plugin Y, or,  a standalone service to be accessible by others through an interface that does xyz). This scope must be specific enough to avoid dumping-ground plugins tht grow with no limit, but also not be so restrictive as to make the plugin so narrowly defined that it is not useful. 2) Is there any other plugin in the same component with an overlapping scope? If so, which plugins? 3) If there is an overlap, is there some technical reason the new plugin or feature is required? 4) If there is no technical reason for the new plugin, would the code fit more appropriately inside an existing plugin instead? 5) What is the expected size of the plugin, now and in the future. (ie, one or two classes to provide a dialog to the user, or, many classes providing a model for xyz and will grow as new features are added, or, unlimited home for all utilities depending on (some subset) of eclipse packages. ) 6) What are the expected upstream dependencies of the plugin (webtools, gef, astools, org.eclipse.team, etc)  7) Give a brief technical overview. *Get Approvals* * * Once these questions are answered, approvals are to be requested from: 1) The component lead, and 2) The project management  Approvals must be granted in the form of a +1 on the jira. To acquire the project management approvals, you may choose to assign the task to a project manager, or email the jbosstools-dev list. Alerting the lists for every new plugin is not required, but is a very nice gesture. You may find contributors come out to add some of their code to a new more central location after hearing about the new plugin and it's pre-defined scope. Typically, approvals for new plugins or features will not be granted during a "rampdown" period, as we get close to a major release, without some strong technical issues requriing the creation of a new plugin. Once these approvals are granted, you will want to move on to the  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18373 Technical Side of adding a new plugin and feature.</body>

While there is no official process declared yet, in general, maintenance patches require approval from PM or at the very least another committer on the same component. During rampdown for a major release, such as during candidate releases, similar restrictions are in place. Look here for more information in the future.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Re: JBoss Transaction Not Active - EJB 2.1 in JBOSS EAP 5.1.2</header>
    <body>Hi Mike, Getting back to you again. We identified the issue of the problem but we are stucked on what direction to go. The original developers of the code put in some logic (db handling) on the ejbPassivate callback method. In this method (which you see above) has a indirect call to getConnection which causes the error. public void ejbPassivate() * *JobJDBCMgr* m_mgr = (JobJDBCMgr) getJDBCManager();*                                         try                                         catch( IOException e ) *m_mgr.updateWithActiveJob(getJobData(), rawActiveJob, getId() );*                                              ......// SOME CODE HERE                               else      ......// SOME CODE HERE      ......// SOME CODE HERE Most of the ejbCallBack methods have their own method variable JobJDBCMgr.  I tried to create CLASS level JDBC manager and it did solve the problem.. (*TEMPORARILY*).  This solution is working for some logic flow but NOT for all business logic (processes that takes around few seconds (10 secs or more)). Why I created a Class level variable - I want to retain the instance of the JobJDBCMgr Object when the Bean is pushed into the POOL. Do you have any idea on how to resolve this issue? My timeout is set to a very high value (42000). Hoping for your reply.</body>

    <body>Hi Mike, Its me again. Another solution that I thought of, is to remove the logic in the ejbPassivate. But doing so, will totally remov the business logic the previous developers set. We tried placing the logic in ejbStore (since based on the ejb call back sequence, ejbStore comes first before ejbPassivate) but its not working. Hope you can shed light into this problem of ours.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - AS7: Utilising masked passwords via the vault</header>
    <body>I need an example of putting two passwords into the vault and then referencing them in standalone.xml. I have referenced the keystore file and password via the vault in the ssl connector line in standalone.xml, and have put the following reference to the trsutstore and password in as system properties. If I hardcode the unmasked truststore password all works, but even when using teo interactive sessions (so that I get a separate handle for the second password, see bug 901125), I cannot put two passwords into the vault and get the truststore reference to work. I get IOException: keystore was tampered with of password is incorrect. In standalone.xml: &lt;system-property&gt;   &lt;property name="javax.net.ssl.trustStore" value="Path /to/truststore/file" /&gt;   &lt;property name="javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword" value="VAULT::truststore_pass::password::YjdkMDU10TMzTdmy........." /&gt; &lt;/system-property&gt; Do I need more lines in the &lt;vault&gt; &lt;vault-option&gt; section to reference the second password? Two vault tags will not parse. Any suggestions or two password example would be most welcome. I have tried referencing the keystore password with the same vault handle since it is the same--does not work. And I have generated vault dat files using  a reference to the keystore alone or with a separate reference to the truststore. Neither approach works. Thanks   Geoffrey Bays</body>

Running UnitTest case (by extending JbpmJUnitTestCase) Process flow works fine and process completes successfully  BUT when i use spring configuration to deploy and run Business Process then  HumanTask is never created  in database , hence querying it using LocalTaskService results in Nothing. i am using single persistence unit (process+task) and running a localTaskService to assign/complete workitem. can somone please take a look and help. There are two zip files : 1) (test-success) that contains persistence.xml used by test case , respective passing junit test case and console logs. 2) (process-spring) that contains spring config file , jbpm utility class (used to create session and taskservice), failing test case(uses this spring config) and console logs. from two logs i can clearly see that in Testcase (uses spring config) process goes fine and inserts entry in workitemInfo table but the does not create an Entry in Task table. i checked everything but unable to find a clue. thanks Mayank</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Ideas for speeding up resource recovery</header>
    <body>*h2. Problem:* For various reasons the recovery system cannot be migrated to a different host meaning that in failure scenarios transactions cannot always be recovered in a timely manner. Initial discussion of the problem is captured in the following JIRAs: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-312 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-312 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1359 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1359 *h2. Background:* The Narayana project is logically comprised of a transaction manager (TM) and a recovery manager (RcMgr). When the TM decides to commit a transaction it indelibly records details of each participant involved in the transaction in an Object Store (ObjStore) (we have many object store implementations but this is not particularly relevant to the problem at hand). If the TM cannot complete the transaction, due to failures in the system, responsibility for completing the transaction passes to the RcMgr which takes its input from the contents of the ObjStore. In a JTA environment we record representations of participants in the ObjStore as "XA records" identified by XIDs which in turn embed a node id. This node id corresponds to the TM instance that enlisted the participant into the transaction. In this way the indelible record of the participant can be traced back to the initiating TM (but more importantly it provides a way to pass responsibility for progressing the participant to a particular RcMgr). Now conventionally we run the TM and RcMgr within a JEE app server in which the default configuration is to operate on the same ObjStore. In this configuration the RcMgr will only recover ObjStore records whose node id matches the co located TM. Generally this scheme works fine (although separating them would increase availability) since the recovery system has access to the same set of XA resources that TM does so recovery will proceed as soon as the relevant XA resources become available. Problems may arise if: 5. the underlying object store becomes inaccessible. In the following we primarily discuss JTS but REST-AT is similar. We also briefly alude to XTS and largely ignore JTA since JTA should "just work" with the proposed solution. But the real question will be: will this approach work, does it contain any show stoppers and are there any issues, XTS aside, which have not been addressed? *h2. Solution:* This post proposes a solution that will overcome each of these problems by grouping a set of transaction managers into an HA cluster with each TM configured to use the same set of datasources and a single shared object store. The recovery system runs on a single node in the cluster and operates on the shared object store. Participants recover on the same node as the recovery system (which in general will be a different node from the one where the participant last failed). This approach resolves the above mentioned problems in the following manner: 5. use high availability storage (such as a database or a Storage Area Network) for the ObjStore or use data replication (if customers really want this we should defer to a future PRD since it is non trivial). *h2. Problems:* [Note that the default algorithm for constructing UIDs embeds the IP address of the host on which the TM is running but this is fine since we only do so in order to construct unique ids] In JTS the recovery system and resources communicate via IORs which embed endpoint information that refer to the IP address of where the objects can be contacted. This feature creates the two difficulties: 2. If the RcMgr migrates to a new host then participants will no longer be able to call back to the recovery coordinator (as occurs during bottom up recovery) since the IOR of the RcMgr will change. The first difficulty is resolved by bottom up recovery:- when the participant is recreated on the RcMgr node by the recovery system (note that the record that was logged at prepare time contains the information needed to do this) it will inform the RcMgr hat it has moved to a new location (using the replay_completion call on the recovery coordinator). There is a window where this scheme will fail since the RcMgr may migrate after the participant has migrated but before the participant has contacted the RcMgr. In note 2 below we mention that since the ObjStore is globally accessible and since the RcMgr IOR is written to the ObjStore, participants will always be able discover the RcMgr so it should be a straight forward modification to the RcMgr to close this window. The second difficulty becomes an issue if the RcMgr does not have a record of the participant (can happen if the TM fails before writing its prepare log but after some of the participants recorded their prepare decision). In this case top down recovery cannot proceed, nor can bottom up recovery since the IOR of the RcMgr is no longer valid. Since the participant and RcMgr are now running on the same node it should be a fairly non invasive modification to the RcMgr to close this window. *h2. Notes:* 4. Analysis of the effect of the solution on XTS needs to be discussed certainly participant and coordinator endpoints will no longer be valid. If the solution fails for XTS we may need to fallback on demanding IP failover to support the XTS case. *h2. Restrictions:* * only works in an HA cluster (not a problem since this is an EAP feature) * JNDI names of XA resources must be duplicated on all nodes in the cluster * the ObjStore must use storage that is accessible to all nodes and be highly available * databases cannot be shared by Application Servers not in the cluster (see next section for details) *h2. Problems:* 1. An HA singleton is a bean marked with the @Singleton annotation. This bean will be responsible for starting the recovery system. Since beans are started after AS subsystems we have the problem that recovery will start much later than it does at present. 2. Databases/XA Resources are typically used by more than one application server and when asked for in doubt transactions they will return all of them. This will be a problem if the returned list contains transactions created by a server that is not part of the cluster since it is then possible for two different recovery systems to recover the same transaction branch. We can resolve this problem by either demanding that resources are a dedicated to the cluster or we configure the RcMgr to only recover a given set of node ids. To implement the latter option requires that we implement a cluster membership monitor which tells the RcMgr when nodes come and go (which adds complexity to the solution).</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Remoting Development] - SASL and Kerberos</header>
    <body>Working on how Kerberos can be supported with Remoting for  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/REM3-29 REM3-29, the first stage is understanding the unederlying mechanism.  *Please Note, this article is not a user guide, it is a reference guide to hold the information needed so that the issue REM3-129 can be implemented.* Whilst there is some JDK documentation this does not go into the finer details, the implementation makes quite a few assumptions so this article is to capture the additional detail. h1. Client OS local Kerberos configuration can be used to specify the Ream and KDC, alternatively JVM wide system properties can be used: - On the client side unless you fallback to default JAAS configurations the SASL negotiation needs to be within a PrivilegedAction where a Subject for the local clients identity is passed in: -             @Override To obtain the subject a JAAS LoginContext is used with the 'com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule' LoginModule, although JAAS is used we don't need the configuration within a descriptor - we can provide a simplified configuration for the client and dynamically configure the LoginContext. No special configuration of the LoginModule is required on the client side.  There are three configuration options for the client: - 1. Use a supplied CallbackHandler to prompt the client for the username and password, the LoginModule will then obtain their Kerberos tickets. 2. Configure to use a keytab without prompting - useful for unattended processes e.g. server instances. 3. Configure to use local OS cache i.e. if user obtained Kerberos ticket on OS log on use this identity. The client side does not require the 'storeKey' option being set to true although if a process is both a client and a server this can be set to true. Inside the PriviledgedAction the SaslClient can be obtained as: - Sasl.createSaslClient(MECHS, null, "remoting", "test2", Collections.EMPTY_MAP, The parameters are: - 1. Array of mechanisms, in this case just "GSSAPI" 2. The authorization ID, if not supplied it will default to the username at REALM of the user. 3. Protocol 4. Server host name 5. Configuration options 6. Callback Handler *The values for protocol and server host name are criticial to the negotiation process.* In this example before the communication with the server commences the client side will automatically send a TGS-REQ to the KDC for the server name 'remoting/test2' - this is an integral part of the process an if this server is not known by the KDC the process will terminate. Do also note that the host name may undergo the following conversion, the comment in the code openly admints that this is against the RFC but goes ahead and does it anyway.  The end result is that the name could end up being the fully qualified host name of the remote service.  If the server name does not match then the original supplied name is used. // RFC4120 does not recommend canonicalizing a hostname. // However, for compatibility reason, we will try // canonicalize it and see if the output looks better.   String canonicalized = (InetAddress.getByName(hostName)). For this TGS-REQ a service principal mapping on the KDC is sufficient, however there are also issues on the server side of this to consider. There are a couple of options which could be passed in, one is to enable server_auth, this setting means that in addition to the server verifying the identity of the client the client will also verify the identity of the server. At the stage of the SASL message exchange the CallbackHandler on the client is not required to handle any callbacks, the client side idenity has already been established when the Subject was obtained. If this was SPNEGO the web browser would be verifying the DNS name of the server it is connecting to, we should consider if our client should allow any flexibility in the setting of server host name or should we mandate that it does match the host name we are connecting to - at the same point also consider banning connection to IP addresses as DNS is also fundamental to this. h1. Server As for the client side the Realm / KDC configuration is required, again this can either be configured using OS specific configuration or the same system properties can be set. On the server a Subject needs to be obtained similar to how one was obtained for the client, this time the Subject is for the identity of the server - all the Sasl calls will then be within a PriviledgedAction. When the Subject for the server is obtained here it is essential that 'storeKey' is set to true for the LoginModule, this will store the KerberosKeys for the server in the PrivateCredentials of the Subject. On the server side the SaslServer can be obtained with: - SaslServer saslServer = Sasl.createSaslServer(GSSAPI, "remoting", "test2", Collections.EMPTY_MAP, Here the parameters are: - 1. Chosen mechanism "GSSAPI" 2. Protocol 3. Server Host Name 4. Configuration options 5. Callback Handler On the server side the protocol and server host name are again critical to the process but this time they affect how the PrivateCredentials of the Subject are searched. In this example the protocol is 'remoting', the server host name is 'test2' and from the system properties the realm is 'DARRANL.JBOSS.ORG', the private credentials of the Subject will be searched for KerberosKeys with the prinicipal name " mailto:remoting/test2 at DARRANL.JBOSS.ORG remoting/test2 at DARRANL.JBOSS.ORG" On the server side an error indicating "Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos Key" most likely translates to mean that no key has been found with the expected principal name. The server identity does need to match the identity the client received in the TGS-REP from the TGS-REQ that the client sent in, however I need to verify if the names within the Subject also need to match or if we can just allign the createSaslServer identity with what is provided in the Subject.  The reason this needs to be considered is that it may be desirable to just have a single Kerberos identity on the server for both Remoting and HTTP, however for HTTP the identity may already be mapped to HTTP/test2 The only Callback that needs to be supported is the AuthorizeCallback, by default the authentication ID will be in the form username at REALM - there may be some desire to drop the @REALM part. In the exchange between the client and the server we do need to be able to support 0 length SASL messages. There is also an option that may be possible to set on the server side if the identity is only being used for incomming requests and that is to set isInitiator to false, this removes one round trip with the KDC.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Integration Tooling	Release Process</header>
    <body>h1. Overview This document details the process for building and releasing composite/aggregate update sites for the JBoss integration tooling (formerly SOA tools). h2. Goals * Provide a light-weight process with minimal overhead for component owners. * Provide an ever-current update site containing the latest, stable releases of integration tooling components. * Allow component owners to independently manage their release schedules. * Allow component owners to manage their own dependency stack. h2. Assumptions * Components use released versions of dependencies (i.e. stable builds). * Component owners manage their own interdependencies with other integration components. * Components and dependencies adhere to Eclipse API versioning rules. h2. Implications * Aggregate releases will be driven by component releases. * Aggregate releases should manage themselves. * Component nightly/milestone builds should always be compatible with other components in the aggregate. h2. Definitions * *Integration Stack (IS)* - all JBoss middleware integration tooling * *IS configuration* - the definition of specific components and versions that make up the IS * *IS build* - an update site (p2 repo) aggregating specific versions of integration tooling components. * *Release types:** *stable* - an IS build aggregating stable (i.e. final) builds of all components that has been certified/tested by QA. * *development* - an IS build aggregating stable builds of all components that has not been certified/tested by QA. * *integration* - an IS build aggregating stable, development (e.g. beta) and/or integration builds of all components * *next* - an internal IS build incorporating the latest integration builds of all components (i.e. the current "trunk" build).  This will be used for identifying potential future incompatibilities. Stable builds will align  with a JBDS release in the same way JBT core builds do today.  Development builds will reflect the current state of all stable components.  Theoretically, any development build could be QA'd and promoted to stable (assuming no test failures).  Integration builds allow for an "interim" stack which may be useful during a QA cycle (e.g. verifying a fix that requires updates to multiple components; a single component can be updated via the component update site).  Next builds are used to identify potential incompatiblilities among components before they are integrated into a release and would occur weekly/monthly via a Hudson job (e.g. targeting JBT integration builds). An IS build only needs to occur when the IS configuration changes.  Because the IS stack is composed of stable components, configuration changes will only occur when individual components are released.  For this reason, it is assumed the build would be invoked manually. h1. Roles and Responsibilities h2. Component Owners 1. *Component update site:*  Component owners must provide an update site for each release of their component that is included in an IS build. 2. *Updating IS configuration:*  Component owners must update the IS build configuration when a new version of their component is released.  This ensures the IS is up-to-date. 3. *Respond to change requests:*  Component owners must review IS configuration change requests and respond in a timely manner.  If a requested change is incompatible with the current version of your component, provide details regarding when your component will be compatible, along with a patch containing changes to the IS configuration for your compatible release. h2. Release Engineers 1. *Maintain build infrastructure:*  Release engineers will be responsible for maintianing the build infrastructure, primarily the Jenkins jobs. 2. *Processing pull requests:*  Release engineers will be responsible processing all pull requests related to IS configuration.  This is to ensure consistency in the composition of the stack (e.g. components, component versions, IS version, etc.). 3. *Initiate IS builds:*  Release engineers will be responsible for initiating IS builds. 4. *Build promotion:*  Release engineers will be responsible for the promotion of IS builds (e.g. from development to stable). h1. Release Process h2. Component Updates The following outlines the basic process for updating the IS configuration.  Typically, this would occur when a component is released, but the same process is also used for updating shared dependencies (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins, etc.). 1. Create a branch in the user repository for your IS configuration changes. 2. Modify the Integration Stack configuration for your updates, e.g. update URL for SwitchYard from 0.5.0.Final to 0.6.0.Final; update IS version from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (see versioning rules)1. For changes to your component within the community aggregate:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/compositeContent.xml compositeContent.xml files to point to the new component update site. 2. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/jbosstools/site/category.xml category.xml file as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify the project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/pom.xml pom.xml. 2. For changes to your component within the production aggregate:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/compositeContent.xml compositeContent.xml files to point to the new component update site. 2. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/devstudio/site/category.xml category.xml file as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify the project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/pom.xml pom.xml. 3. For changes to dependencies:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform1. Modify  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/integration-stack-base.target integration-stack-base.target,  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/core-base.target core-base.target or  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/community.target community.target 2. Modify project version in  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/target-platform/pom.xml pom.xml 3. Ensure plugins are mirrored on jboss.org 3. Build locally to validate stack dependencies. 4. Create a  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS JBTIS JIRA task requesting update, e.g. update SwitchYard to 0.6.0.Final* Include link to github branch in task * Include build  results (e.g. SUCCESS or specific dependency resolution errors) 5. Create subtasks against each IS component for verification/approval* For components that failed the consistency check, mark subtasks appropriately, e.g. m2e-wtp version is inconsistent 6. Merge any changes required by other components from subtasks (e.g. update Savara to 2.1.0.Final) 7. Build IS locally to validate dependency consistency 8. Issue pull request against upstream IS configuration project 9. Process pull (by release engineer) 10. Invoke build job (by release engineer) h2. Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. JBoss Central Discovery Updates *Goal:* Modify the JBoss Central mylyn discovery install/update mechanism. JBoss Central, based on  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Discovery Mylyn Discovery, is in part a UI for installing new features into Eclipse or JBDS. It provides a richer, yet simpler UI than what Eclipse's p2 Install Manager provides out of the box. For detailed information see  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-48297 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossCentralsSoftwareUpdateTab-HowDoesItWork 1. For changes to the discovery update:   https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/target-platform https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/tree/master/discovery 2. Follow the same git process as defined in the Components Updates section. 3. Modify the discovery connector descriptors and installation units as needed within the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/discovery/plugins/org.jboss.tools.central.discovery.soa-tooling/plugin.xml discovery plugin. 4. Add any icons that may be required. h2. Dependency Updates The process for updating a shared dependency is the same as that for updating any other component, with the following additions: 1. Make sure the dependency is mirrored on jboss.org. 2. Make sure the dependency is not already included through JBT core. If a dependency is included through JBT core, you will need to coordinate with the core team on the upgrade, as the change may impact components outside the IS. h2. Versioning Rules - major.minor.update.build *Major* should be updated for: * Base platform changes, e.g. Eclipse Indigo-&gt;Juno, JBT 3.3-&gt;4.0 * Major component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 1.0-&gt;2.0 *Minor* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5-&gt;0.6 *Update* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5.0-&gt;0.5.1 *Build* should be updated for each build, e.g. when building against nightly/integration/development repositories ** Note, the basic assumption here is that components are adhering to basic API rules (per Eclipse; e.g. minor includes bug fixes and api additions, major may include breaking api changes). h1.

Target Platforms The provided target platforms define all upstream dependencies available to an IS component.  Two target platforms are provided: base and community.  The base target platform includes all dependencies which are also included as part of JBDS.  The community target extends the base target by including dependencies which are only available in  community JBT releases.  If your component needs to be included in a JBDS release, DO NOT use the community target platform.  For more information and an example on how to refer to the target platform definition, see:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/README.md h1. Future Plans 1. Add support for executing component unit tests as part of the aggregate build.  The goal being to help ensure the stability of the aggregate. 2. Add a "next" build that will build against upcoming core platforms (e.g. Kepler, JBT 4.1).  This should serve as an early warning system to identify platform incompatibilities early in the process.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Missing	user.properties</header>
    <body>We have a web application that uses com.sun.security.auth.callback.TextCallbackHandler, javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext and com.sun.security.auth.module.NTLoginModule to do Windows NT security. I've been using it successfully in Tomcat without having to configure Tomcat in any way.  Our app handles the authentication.  When I copy my app over to JBoss 7 I get the error "*PB00015: Null Value:Missing users.properties file."* when invoking loginContext.login.  How do I suppress this and allow the login to occur? I've tried messing around with jboss-web.xml, jboss.xml, standalone.xml, login-config.xml and my web.xml to no avail.  I bundle my own copy of jaas.jar.  I include the following in web.xml to avoid conflicts.   &lt;context-param&gt;     &lt;param-name&gt;org.jboss.jbossfaces.WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL&lt;/param-name&gt;     &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt; I did the following things. jboss-web.xml &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;jboss-web&gt;   &lt;jboss-web&gt;   &lt;context-root&gt;rdWeb&lt;/context-root&gt;   &lt;/jboss-web&gt;  jboss.xml &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;jboss-web&gt;   &lt;jboss&gt;   &lt;security-domain&gt;rdWeb&lt;/security-domain&gt;   &lt;/jboss&gt;   Thanks in advance,                                    Clifton Sothoron</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JBoss Jaas Jersey Rest Authentication and forwarding</header>
    <body>Hi, I have the following Rest service which bypasses the form login and instead authenticates via the Rest service. This is working fine EXCEPT......I need to call the rest URL twice before I am forwarded to the home.xhtml page. The first time I get the login screen. Now, what I don't understand (and can't get to work) is that I am presented with the login screen ALTHOUGH there is a session AND the JAAS login worked already during the first call. Why does the Server not recognize there is already an authenticated session in the browser. How can this be fixed ? Or is there another mechanism I need to implement ? Maybe I am missing some fundamental understanding here ? @GET     public void login(@PathParam(value = "username") String username,             @PathParam(value = "password") String password,             @Context HttpServletRequest request,             @Context HttpServletResponse response) throws NamingException,         // all is well         String passwordhash = Util.createPasswordHash("MD5",         userService = (UserService) new InitialContext()         User user = userService.getUserByUsernameAndPassword(username,             // Response.             // TODO Auto-generated catch block             // TODO Auto-generated catch block I tried both Response.temporaryRedirect and the response.sendRedirect.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Layered Distributions and Module Path Organization</header>
    <body>h1. Overview This document describes notions for how different software distributions based on the JBoss AS 7 project can integrate with the base AS and with each other in a controlled manner. +* *+ h1. Fundamental Concepts h2. Distribution A coherent set of software produced by a "project" or a "product". JBoss AS 7 is a project. JBoss EAP is such a product. Both play similar technical roles in the JBoss ecosystem, but there are significant differences in how the two are made available to end users. This article uses "distribution" as a replacement for constantly saying "project/product" everywhere. It's not a great term; if someone has a better one, please suggest it. h2. Distribution Base The "distribution base" is the core set of modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that is common to all layered distributions. It may itself be usable standalone project or product. Currently the software produced by the JBoss AS 7 project and the JBoss EAP product are the distribution bases relevant to this discussion. In the future a more limited subset of functionality may become the distribution base, with the full set of functionality currently provided in community AS and EAP coming as layered distributions or add-ons. h2. Layered Distribution A distribution that builds on top of the distribution base, potentially superceding some of the distribution base's functionality. A layered distribution is allowed to supercede any aspect of the distribution base's functionality. The less the layered distribution does this, the easier it will be for the layered distribution to manage things like patching, but, if necessary, a layered distribution can supercede anything in the distribution base. A layered distribution may build on top of another layered distribution, provided it has worked out the necessary procedures to ensure compatibility. h2. Identity An identity is a named set of distribution base + layered distribution(s) that is certified as a valid combination. The distribution base by itself may or may not be a valid identity. Currently it is; in the future it may not be. The software produced by a given layered distribution may be associated with more than one identity. h3. Patching and Identities Patches are applicable to an identity. A given patch can apply to more than one identity, if there are no conflicts between the identities in terms of how they use the items modified by a patch. The metadata associated with a patch will indicate the identities to which it is applicable. Patches are comprised of one or more discrete +patch elements+ each of which is produced by the distribution base or by one of the layered distributions associated with the identity. A patch element includes metadata describing the element along with any added or modified files. The patch element metadata will identify the provider of the patch component. A given patch element can be used in multiple different patches. For example, a patch element upgrading the distribution base can be included in several patches produced by different identities, with each patch also including a patch element upgrading a layered distribution used in that identity. For example, let's say an identity named I consists of the distribution base and a layered distribution named A. Version 1.0 of identity I is based on version 2.0 of the distribution base and version 1.0 of layered distribution A. The distribution base produces a patch element that will move it to version 2.1. The producers of the I identity could then produce a patch that will result in version 1.1 of identity A. This would include a patch element upgrading layered distribution A to its version 1.1, as well as the separate element that provides the distribution base upgrade to its 2.1. There are two main benefits of this sharing approach: * The modules and bundles provided by the distribution base upgrade are associated with the original 2.1 patch provided by the distribution base, not just with the enclosing patch provided by A. This will make possible the sharing of modules/bundles provided by patches across installations. * Incorporating one patch within another as a simple discrete unit helps avoid errors during patch production. For modules and bundles within a patch, once the patch is applied the association of the module or bundle with the distribution base or layer that provided it is retained within the installation. The association is encoded within the filesystem path that points to the patch version of the module or bundle. Miscellaneous files within a patch are not associated with the distribution base or any particular layered distribution once they are installed. For example bin/standalone.sh is bin/standalone.sh no matter what patch component added or modified it. Each identity produces a patch stream. Because a given patch can apply to more than one identity, the same patch can appear in multiple patch streams. The distribution base and layered distributions can produces +patch elements+ but they cannot themselves produce +patches+ or a patch stream. Since a patch must be associated with an an identity, only an identity (or a group of cooperating identities) can produce a patch. If there is an identity that consists of nothing but the distribution base, that identity can produce a patch. But this is logically not the same thing as saying the distribution base itself produced the patch, even though the practical effect is similar. h2. Installation An installation is a single filesystem location containing the distribution base plus zero or more layered distributions. It includes the bin/ dir from which processes are launched. The root of the installation is the path indicated by the $JBOSS_HOME environment variable referred to in the scripts and indicated by the jboss.home.dir system property used in the java code. h3. Installation Identity Each installation has a *+single identity+*. Because an installation only has a single identity, there is no confusion as to which layered distribution "owns" a particular filesystem location in that installation. Further, because the identity of an installation can be easily determined (see "Establishing Identity" below), external tools can quickly understand the functionality provided by a given installation, even if no process is currently running from the installation. +TODO further spell out the importance of single identity.+ h3. Sharing Files Across Installations+ + The files that comprise modules and bundles are potentially sharable across installations. Making it easy for users to do this should be a key goal. Miscellaneous files are not sharable across installations. An end user could potentially share them using symlinks, but doing so is not a supported feature nor is it a recommended practice. Patches are not sharable across installations. The +modules and bundles that the patch provides+ are potentially sharable, but the miscellaneous files provided by a patch are not sharable. The patching history metadata that the patching tool records in the installation is also not sharable -- the metadata is associated with the given installation. However, making it easy to share the the modules and bundles provide by a patch across installations should be a key goal. h2. Add-On Distribution An add-on distribution is a set of software that extends the capabilities of a given "identity". An add-on can only extend capabilities. It is not allowed to supercede capabilities of the identity it extends. For modules and OSGi bundles, the module and bundle loading logic provided by the distribution base will enforce this behavior. For miscellaneous files, it is up to the people providing an add-on to ensure that the add-on does not overwrite any file provided by the distribution base, any layered distribution associated with the identity or any other add-ons associated with the identity. Conversely, once the providers of an identity have accepted an add-on into their ecosystem, it is their responsibility to ensure that they do not add any files to their distributions that will conflict with files already provided by the add-on. In practice, the most likely sources of conflict will be the xml files in the configuration directories and the .conf files in the bin directory. Conflicts over xml files are solvable by having add-on providers ship their own xml file variants rather than attempting to modify the standard ones that ship with the identity. A given add-on is allowed to extend the capabilities of more than one identity. An add-on may require the presence of other add-ons. h3. Patching and Add-ons Add-on distributions produce their own patch stream. The patches produced by an add-on indicate the versions of the identity that must be present for the patch to apply. More than one identity can be listed, since add-ons may be applicable to multiple identities. The patches produced by an add-on also indicate the existing version of the add-on that must be present, as well as the version of any other required add-ons. Add-ons cannot use patches in their own stream to fix problems in the identity on which they depend. Add-ons depend on the patch stream provided by their dependent identity to provide such fixes. Modules and bundles provided by an add-on or its patches will have lower precedence in the module loading order than those that come from the distribution base or layered distributions, so any fix to such a module/bundle provided by an add-on patch will have no effect. h1. Installers +TODO discussion of RPM+ h2. Distribution Base Installers The distribution base can be installed via a simple unzip. If the distribution base is itself an identity, see also "Identity Installers" h2. Identity Installers An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that already contains a depended upon identity or the installation base of a zip that only includes the layered distribution(s) to be added. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an identity is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is irrevocably changed.+* When an identity is installed it has the right to modify any miscellaneous files in the installation filesystem, so once an identity is installed, the identity of the installation is changed. In many (hopefully nearly all) cases it may be possible for a user to remove files added by an identity install and get the installation back to its previous identity, but doing this is not a supported feature of the software and is not a recommended practice. *+However, once support for installing patches via the patching tool is available, reverting an identity installation will be possible.+* The patching tool maintains backup copies of any miscellaneous files modified by a patch, making it possible to restore those files. h2. Add-on Installer An add-on can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions along with the add-on itself. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that contains the depended upon identity of a zip that only includes the add-on. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an add-on is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is not changed, and it must be possible to reverse the installation.+* An add-on is merely additive, so removing it is a matter of deleting what was added. This could be done via a script provided by the add-on, via an installer program, or manually by a user following a set of instructions. h1. Establishing Identity It +must+ be possible for external tools to determine the identity of a given installation without requiring the software based on that installation to be running. It's also necessary for the software based on an installation to determine its own identity. The identity of an installation is provided via the bin/product.conf file located in the distribution. The product.conf file is a simple properties file that contains the following property: slot=&lt;simple string name for identity&gt; For example: slot=eap The value of "slot" is used by the running software to identify the "slot" portion of the identifier of a jboss-modules module. The software uses the slot to load a module named org.jboss.as.product:&lt;value of slot property&gt;, e.g. org.jboss.as.product:eap. The software will then read manifest properties included in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file located in that module to find out other identifying information for the identity. Currently supported manfiest properties include: * JBoss-Product-Release-Name -- Provides the name of the identity for use in the management API and in places like the startup and shutdown log messages. * JBoss-Product-Release-Version -- Provides the version of the identity for use in the management API and in places like the startup and shutdown log messages. * JBoss-Product-Console-Slot -- Used to drive what variant of the management console should be loaded. The notion here is there are different streams of consoles being produced, one for community AS releases and one for product releases, differentiated primarily by cosmetic differences. This property drives which of the two streams of console releases should be used when the console module is loaded. +The use of "Slot" in this property name is a bit unfortunate since it implies an implementation detail that may very well change. The name of the property may change in a future minor release of the AS or EAP and will very likely change in the next major release. The values we used for this attribute in AS 7 and EAP 6.0 and 6.1 are "main" to indicate the community console stream and "eap" to indicate the product console stream. These values are also unfortunate in that "main" implies an implementation detail and "eap" implies the console is not appropriate for other products based on EAP. Better values would be "community" and "product" or something like that. These values may also change in a future minor release of the AS or EAP and will very likely change in the next major release.+ If no bin/product.conf file exists, the installation is assumed to be the community version of the distribution base. If the product.conf file contains other properties besides slot, the software will use those properties to set system properties in the runtime. However, the properties in the file will not take precedence over other mechanisms for setting system properties (i.e. the command line, the standard scripts or the xml configuration files.) Note also that the reading of product.conf occurs after primordial boot, so this mechanism should not be used for setting properties needed immediately on launch. The values are unknown to the JVM launcher, will be unknown to jboss-modules when it sets up the modular classloading environment, and will be unknown to the logging system until any logging subsystem in the xml configuration file is processed. The software based on the installation will also need to know the name of any layered distributions used by the identity, in order of the precedence to be used when loading their modules and/or bundles. This information will be done via a modules/layers.conf file located in the distribution. This file will be a simple properties file that includes a single property: layers=&lt;comma delimited list of layered distribution names with earlier names taking precedence&gt; For example, assuming we have layered distribution named "soa" and "brms" with "brms" taking precedence over "soa": layers=brms,soa There is no need to include "base" in the list of layers; if not present "base" will be appended to the list of layers as the lowest precedence layer. It is legal to include "base" in the list, though. If the modules/layers.conf file does not exist or no layered distributions are named in it, only the base and any add-ons will be used. h1. Module Loading JBoss AS currently loads modules based on a "module path" which is a list of filesystem locations which JBoss Modules searches for modules. In our standard launch scripts, users are able to manipulate this module path by setting the $JBOSS_MODULEPATH environment variable. If not set, $JBOSS_MODULEPATH is set to $JBOSS_HOME/modules. The module path is provided to the running process via the -mp command line argument that is set in our standard scripts. This mechanism creates a single default location under which modules can be located. This is problematic when layered distributions and add-ons wish to install their own modules, since there are no clear rules as to how those modules should be installed or how they relate to one another. h2. Goals * To make it easy for layered distributions or add-ons to add their modules to the set of available modules or remove their modules from the set of available modules, without fear of physically overwriting modules provided by others. * To establish clear rights and responsibilities for providers of the distribution base, layered distributions and add-ons with respect to how their modules should be managed. * To establish clear rules for how distributions that add modules that must take precedence over other modules provided by other distributions with the same name and slot should:* locate those modules * indicate at launch time to the modular classloading system the precedence order * To make it easy for end users to alter the module path for their own purposes by setting $JBOSS_MODULEPATH without needing to concern themselves with details of how the modules provided by the distribtuion base, layered distributions, or add-ons relate to one another. Reserve the use of $JBOSS_MODULEPATH and the value of the -mp command line argument passed to jboss-modules for end use uses. h2. Rights and Responsibilities of Module Providers All modules provided as part of the distribution base can be depended upon by any add-on associated with an identity. If the distribution base by itself is an identity (i.e. with no additional layered distribution required), the providers of the distribution base accept the following with respect to that identity: * The version of the module the distribution base provides will take precedence over a module with the same name and slot provided by any add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch will need to be tested for compatibility with add-ons based on the version of the identity being patched. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the distribution base cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the distribution base itself no longer needs that module. If the distribution base is part of an identity along with one or more layered distributions, the providers of the distribution base accept the following with respect to that identity: * The distribution base has the same responsibilities with respect to add-ons that it has in the case of add-ons without any layered distribution. * However, if a layered distribution in an identity provides a module with the same name and slot as the one provided by the distribution base, the distribution base no longer has responsibility to provide the module. The layered distribution's version of the module takes precedence. * The distribution base can modify a module that is depended upon by a layered distribution in a way that breaks functionality of the layered distribution. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the distribution base before making them available for use with the identity. If the distribution base patch element in some way breaks the functionality of an identity, either the patch element should not be provided for the identity, or the patch that incorporates the distribution base patch element should also include a layered distribution patch element that fixes the problem.* However, the distribution base should take great care not to break layered distributions with which it is associated when it produces patch elements. Distribution base patch element production should involve reasonable testing of all relevant identities such that problems can be found and resolved before the distribution base patch element ships. * The distribution base can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on but which is depended upon by a layered distribution. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the distribution base before making them available for use with the identity. If the distribution base removes a module depended upon by a layered distribution, the patch that incorporates the distribution base patch element should also include a layered distribution patch element that adds the module as part of the layered distribution. * If an identity add-on depends on a module provided by the distribution base and the distribution base wishes to remove the module, that is allowed provided some layered distribution is willing to begin providing the same module in an overall patch. All modules provided as part of a layered distribution can be depended upon by any add-on associated with an identity. They cannot be depended upon by the distribution base. When a layered distribution includes a module it accepts the following: * The version of the module it provides will take precedence over a module with the same name and slot provided by the distribution base or by any add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch element will need to be tested for compatibility with add-ons based on that version of the identity. Any functionality provided by the distribution base and supported by the identity will also have to be tested. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the layered distribution cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the layered distribution itself no longer needs that module. * A layered distribution can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on. If a layered distribution participates in an identity with another layered distribution that depends on it, the depended-on layer accepts the following: * If the dependent layered distribution provides a module with the same name and slot as the one provided by the depended-on layer, the depended-on layer no longer has responsibility to provide the module to the dependent or to any add-ons. The dependent layered distribution's version of the module takes precedence. * The depended-on layer can modify a module that is depended upon by another layer in a way that breaks functionality of the dependent. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the component layers before making them available for use with the identity. If the depended-on layer's patch element in some way breaks the functionality of an identity, either the patch should not be provided for the identity, or the patch element that incorporates the depended-on layer's patch component should also include a patch element to a dependent layer that fixes the problem.* However, a depended-on layer should take great care not to break dependent layers when it produces patch elements. Layered distribution patch production should involve reasonable testing of all relevant identities such that problems can be found and resolved before the depended-on layer's patch ships. * A depended-on layer can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on but which is depended upon by another layer. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by a depended-upon layered distribution before making them available for use with the identity. If the depended-upon layer removes a module that is depended upon by another layer, the patch that incorporates the depended-upon layer's patch element should also include a patch element from the dependent layer distribution that adds the module as part of that layered distribution. * If an add-on depends on a module provided by the layered distribution and the layered distribution wishes to remove the module, that is allowed provided some other layered distribution in the identity is willing to begin providing the same module in an overall patch. When an add-on includes a module, it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the add-on is associated: * The distribution base or a layered distribution may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the module provided by the add-on. * Another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * Another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of the depended-upon module in a patch element will need to be tested for compatibility with any add-on based on the same major version of the identity.* The providers of the add-on are responsible for providing an adequate set of tests to the providers of the identity. * The distribution base or a layered distribution cannot depend upon a module provided by an add-on. * As a consequence of the previous point, an add-on can remove a module in a patch, without fear of breaking the core functionality of an identity. * An add-on can depend up a shareable module provided by another add-on upon which it depends, but +only with the express consent of the providers of that add-on+. Such dependencies are strongly discouraged. * If an add-on allows another add-on to depend upon its modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons. Testing procedures must be created to ensure that any patches produced by the depended-upon add-on do not break the dependent add-on. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the add-on cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another add-on, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module. h2. Module Organization on the Filesystem This section will describe how the above points are reflected in the actual organization of modules on the filesystem. h4. Requirement for Standardized Module Loading JBoss Modules can support other mechanisms for finding module content and loading it besides the filesystem-based module path mechanism. Theoretically a custom boot module loader implementation could be specified at process launch, with that module loader using some other means for locating module content. This article proposes that this capability be declared as unsupported for JBoss AS and products based upon it. Rather, the AS will have a specified boot module loader implementation. Users of the AS community project are free to use a non-standard boot module loader implementation, but if they do so and certain features provided by the AS don't work, that is their problem. h3. Filesystem Layout Modules would be organized on the filesystem as follows: modules + system ++ add-ons +++ abc +++ def ++ layers +++ base +++ vuw +++ xyz The system level exists to separate modules associated with the distribution base, layered distribution or add-ons from those the end user may store in the modules directory. +(Note: in earlier versions of this document, "internal" was used instead of "system" with a request for suggestions of something better.)+ h3. Translation of Filesystem Layout into Module Loading Precedence For any location provided by the user via the -mp switch, the module loader will look for the system structure. The module loader will understand the structure above and will apply module loading precedence rules as follows. Assume the above structure exists under $JBOSS_HOME and that the user sets $JBOSS_MODULEPATH as follows JBOSS_MODULESPATH=/user/me/my-modules;$JBOSS_HOME/modules In addition, the bin/product.conf file declares that the identity of the install is xyz, the xyz layered distribution should be loaded and the xyz layered distribution depends on the vuw layered distribution. Assume also that patches named base-1, abc-1, def-1, vuw-1, xyz-1 and xyz-2 have been applied. The module loader would look for modules on the filesystem in following locations, starting with first and terminating as soon as the module is found: /user/me/my-modules /modules (in case the user placed modules directly in under this directory) /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-1 /modules/system/layers/xyz /modules/system/layers/vuw/patches/vuw-1 /modules/system/layers/vuw /modules/system/layers/base/patches/base-1 /modules/system/layers/base /modules/system/add-ons/abc/patches/abc-1 /modules/system/add-ons/abc /modules/system/add-ons/def/patches/def-1 /modules/system/add-ons/def The precedence order between /modules/system/add-ons/abc and /modules/system/add-ons/def is arbitrary. An add-on should never assume its modules will take precedence over those of any other add-on's modules. The fact that the various patches locations are included in the path is entirely due to +metadata+ that the patching tool will store in the $JBOSS_HOME/patches directory. The mere presence of a directory like /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 is insufficient to trigger inclusion of that directory in the module search path. However, when the patching tool installs the patch, the actual location of the +module contents+ will be in /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 -- only patching related metadata will be stored in $JBOSS_HOME/patches. This behavior is important for allowing sharing of modules across installations. h2. Sharing Modules Across Installations The above behavior makes it relatively straightforward for a user to share modules across installations. For example, the user could set up a shared module repo in /user/me with the following structure jboss-module-repo + add-ons ++ abc ++ def + layers ++ base ++ vuw ++ xyz The $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system location in each installation on the filesystem could then be replaced with a symlink to /user/me/jboss-module-repo. The downside to this very simple sharing is the abc and def add-ons will be visible and used by all installations, whether or not they are relevant to the installation's identity. A solution to this problem would be to do more symlinks: $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/layers -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/layers $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/add-ons/abc -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/abc $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/add-ons/def -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/def As an improvement at some point we could define some sort of file format (say xml) and allow a file with that format to be placed in $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system in lieu of the subdirectories. The file would include all of the mapping information for the external repo. The boot module loader, patching tool and any programmatic installers would know how to read and update that file. The file would only include information for the add-ons relevant to the installation. h3. Implications for the Patching Tool The possibility of module sharing doesn't remove the requirement to apply a patch to each installation on a given filesystem. Applying the patch to each installation is required in order to: *  update any miscellaneous files * record the patching metadata for the particular installation * allow the patching tool to understand what combinations of layered distributions and add-ons are relevant to the given installation However, the patching tool should recognize the possibility of this kind of module sharing. When it applies a patch it should recognize that the modules may already exist on the filesystem and should not apply them again if not necessary. It should however record some information in, e.g. /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 indicating that the installation being patched is using that set of patch modules. This information will prevent deletion of patch modules used by multiple installations if one of the installations uses the patching feature's cleanup functions. h1. OSGi Bundle Loading OSGi bundle loading will follow the same rules as for module loading. The file used to specify what layers should be used will be a layers.conf file found in each directory in the bundle path (i.e. $JBOSS_HOME/bundles/layers.conf.) +The bundle loading mechanism will not use+ +$JBOSS_HOME/modules/layers.conf for identifying layers. Identities that wish to include bundles in layers other than the base will need to provide a $JBOSS_HOME/bundles/layers.conf.+</body>

    <body>As I continue to learn my way around jBPM I think I've found a couple of issues that the developers might need to be aware of. These are either bugs, features or potential updates. Can anyone offer guidance on how to raise these on Jira? (Is there a guidance not on what should be raised via Jira and what should be left on the user forum?) For example, as I am using 5.4.0.Final do I enter raise everything against that version even though it may be a suggested update for later versions? Thanks Andy McC</body>

I usually suggest to report the issue, in Jira you can select the affected version and the developers will choose the version in which the bug or the feature request will be included. In order to create an Issue you should have a jira account and inside it you can select the project, in this case jBPM. Cheers</body>

So if have - *message.getBody.add("default") and* *message.getBody.add("test", "testData");* *In the invoked service I cannot get to testData*. I can get to the default value, which is stored against the jboss default key. Any ideas on why the message data is lost ? May be the implementation only copies the default value over. What are my alternate options to pass some data. I am playing with settng this data against the Properties and it seems to be working. Thanks</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much</header>
    <body>I'm using this article as a place for people to review a blog post I'm preparing. The plan is to base my JUDCon:Boston talk roughly on this blog post. In addition to this theory, my presentation will include plenty of code examples for each of the scenarios. These code examples will demonstrate the current design of the compensations API. I'll also be adding sections at the end to explain what we have implemented so far and our future roadmap. My current thoughts are that this text is too long for a blog post. h1. Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much. h1. Part 1: Introduction ACID transactions are a useful tool for application developers and can provide very strong guarantees, even in the presence of failures. However, ACID transactions are not always appropriate for every situation. ACID transactions are achieved by holding locks on resources and require the ability to rollback changes. In some situations, the blocking nature of the protocol can be too limiting to performance, especially if the transaction is distributed. Also, some actions can’t simply be rolled back; for example, sending an email. A common strategy for applications that can’t use ACID, is to throw out transactions altogether. However, with this approach you are missing out on many of the benefits that transactions can provide. There are alternative transaction models that relax some of the ACID properties, while still retaining many of the strong guarantees essential for building robust enterprise applications. These should be considered before deciding not to use transactions at all. In a recent post I talked about the work we are doing, in the Narayana project, to improve support for compensation-based transactions. In this post I’ll show the recent improvements we've made and how this technology can be applied to scenarios in which ACID transactions are frequently seen as inappropriate. What is a ‘Compensation-based transaction’? In an ACID transaction, changes are not visible outside of the transaction until it completes. An atomic outcome is guaranteed using a two-phase protocol in which locks are obtained prior to the first phase and released in the second phase. The transaction manager guarantees an atomic outcome, even in the presence of failures. [TODO: show sequence diagram with locks] In a compensation-based transaction, changes are visible outside of the transaction as soon as they are made. If any of the participants are unsuccessful, the transaction compensates those participants that have already completed their work. This compensation action is application specific and is required to ‘undo’ the changes made by the transaction. Similarly to the ACID transaction, the transaction manager guarantees an atomic outcome, even in the presence of failures. [TODO: show sequence diagram with locks] h4. When are Compensation-based Transactions a good fit? h6. Non-transactional work ACID transactions rely on the work supporting rollback. This is fine for work that interacts with transactional resources, such as databases or message queues. However actions like sending an email cannot be rolled back. Here a compensation-based transaction can be used as an alternative. In this case the compensation action is to send another email notifying the recipient of the final outcome. Alternatively, you may have multiple XA (two-phase) aware resources, but due to performance reasons you need to run them in one-phase mode. Maybe you have a combination of transactional and non-transactional work. In this case the transactional work can be rolled back, if required, whilst the non-transactional resources are compensated. Also, you may have transactional resources or services, but, for whatever reason, they will not participate in an existing transaction. This can occur when you try to compose multiple services outside of your control. For example, a travel agent application may compose a transaction of calls to third party services. Providing these services offer an interface for cancelling (compensating) a booking, you should be able to use a compensation-based transaction to coordinate them. If you find yourself needing to coordinate multiple non-transactional tasks, you should consider using compensations. h6. Cross-Domain Distributed Transactions When your application becomes distributed, you greatly increase the chances of failure. Many of these failures can be tolerated by using a distributed ACID transaction. However, this approach is often dismissed as impractical for a number of reasons. The first is that distributed transactions tend to take longer to run, due to the increased communication latency. This can cause big problems for your throughput as the duration of held locks greatly increases. The second issue is that all the servers in the distributed transaction become tightly-coupled. Furthermore, the server that begun the transaction has full control over when the transaction should complete (ignoring the option of making a heuristic decision, which is really bad!). This may be acceptable if all the servers reside in the same business domain, but it’s rarely acceptable for cross-business domain applications. Compensation-based transactions can be used to solve both of these problems. The latency imposed by the distributed transaction does not result in holding of locks for extended periods as the work is completed immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the transaction. If this work was a database update, it would be committed immediately. A second database update would be made to undo the change, should compensation be required. Compensation-based transactions also encourage a loosely-coupled architecture as each participant offers a more natural interface to the coordinator. For example, in a flight booking example, the service interface would consist of ‘bookFlight’ and ‘cancelFlight’ operations (‘cancel’ being the compensating action). h6. Long Lived Transactions (LLT) ACID transactions are not particularly well suited for transactions that take a long time to run. This is because they acquire locks on resources as they progress and don’t release them until the transaction completes. In the meantime, other transactions, requiring that data, are blocked. Furthermore, a failure of a long running transaction results in the loss of all work completed so far. A compensation-based transaction can be composed of multiple short-lived ACID transactions. When each transaction completes, it releases the locks on the data it held, allowing other transactions, requiring that data, to proceed. A compensation action is registered for each ACID transaction. These actions are invoked, in reverse order, for all completed transactions, should the LLT need to be aborted. Furthermore, should one of these short-lived transactions fail, it could be possible to find an alternative, preventing the entire transaction from failing, and allowing forward progress to be achieved. Also, in some situations, as the transaction progresses, you may decide to abort just part of the transaction. For example, take a travel booking example. We begin by booking a flight. We then try to book a taxi, but that fails. At this point we don’t want to compensate the flight as it may be fully-booked next time we try. Therefore we try to find an alternative Taxi, which in this example succeeds. Later, in the LLT, we may find a cheaper flight, in which case we want to cancel the original flight whilst keeping the taxi and booking the cheaper flight. In this case we notify our intentions to the transaction manager who ensures that the more expensive flight is compensated when the LLT completes. h6. Conclusion In this blog post I’ve introduced the concept of a compensation-based transaction and showed how it could be used to provide strong guarantees in situations that are not applicable for ACID transactions. Most of what is discussed here is already supported through our WS-BA implementation. We are currently in the process of decoupling this technology from Web Services and improving the developer API.</body>

    <body>I don't think it's too long for a blog post, but if you do then why not break it up into a series? ACID does not require locks. You can use timestamps, for instance. It's also wrong to say that locking "achieves" ACID transactions, since locks (or some form of concurrency control) is only applicable to the I in ACID. You mention the blocking nature of transactions, but don't say why it exists. It's not to do with locking, but that is the inference. Unfortunately whilst the strict 2PC protocol guarantees atomicity, no transaction manager actually implement that otherwise we'd have transactions that don't (can't) complete. Hence heuristics. In general I think there are too many generalities in the text so far, such as "In a compensation-based transaction, changes are visible outside of the transaction as soon as they are made." That's only true for certain compensation transaction models, not all. And they don't guarantee an atomic outcome any more than ACID transaction managers do.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much</header>
    <body>I'm using this article as a place for the community to review a series of blog posts I'm preparing. The plan is to base my JUDCon:Boston talk roughly on this series of blog posts. The code examples will demonstrate the current design of the compensations API. I'll also be adding sections at the end of the talk, to explain what we have implemented so far and our future roadmap; I'm not sure how much of this I will cover in the blog posts. Maybe I'll have a part 5, that covers this. h1. Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much. h1. Part 1: Introduction ACID transactions are a useful tool for application developers and can provide very strong guarantees, even in the presence of failures. However, ACID transactions are not always appropriate for every situation. In this series of blog posts. I'll present several such scenarios and show how an alternative  non-ACID transaction model can be used. The isolation property of an ACID transaction is typically acheived through optimistc [REF] or pessimistic [REF] concurrency control. Neither approach works well if the duration of the transaction exceeds a few seconds [REF]. This can frequently be the case for transactions involving slow participants (humans, for example) or those distributed over high latency networks. Also, some actions can’t simply be rolled back; such as, the sending of an email or the invocation of some third-party service. A common strategy for applications that can’t use ACID, is to throw out transactions altogether. However, with this approach you are missing out on many of the benefits that transactions can provide. There are many alternative transaction models that relax some of the ACID properties, while still retaining many of the strong guarantees essential for building robust enterprise applications. These models are often refered to as "Extended Transaction models" and should be considered before deciding not to use transactions at all. In the Narayana project, we have support for two Extended Transaction models; "Nested Transactions" and a compensation-based model based on "Sagas" [REF]. In this series of blog posts I'll be focusing on the compensation-based approach. The following three posts will each focus on a particular area where compensation-based transations could prove to be a better fit than ACID transactions. I'll also present the latest iteration of our new API, that was first introduced in [REF]. In the final part i'll cover the current status of this API and present the current roadmap for the outstanding features. What is a ‘Compensation-based transaction’? In an ACID transaction, changes are not visible outside of the transaction until it completes. An atomic outcome is guaranteed using a two-phase protocol in which locks are obtained prior to the first phase and released in the second phase. The transaction manager guarantees an atomic outcome, even in the presence of failures. [TODO: show sequence diagram with locks] In a compensation-based transaction, changes are visible outside of the transaction as soon as they are made. If any of the participants are unsuccessful, the transaction compensates those participants that have already completed their work. This compensation action is application specific and is required to ‘undo’ the changes made by the transaction. Similarly to the ACID transaction, the transaction manager guarantees an atomic outcome, even in the presence of failures. [TODO: show sequence diagram with locks] h1. Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much. Part 2: Non-Transactional Work h4. Introduction [TODO] h6. Non-transactional work ACID transactions rely on the work supporting rollback. This is fine for work that interacts with transactional resources, such as databases or message queues. However actions like sending an email cannot be rolled back. Here a compensation-based transaction can be used as an alternative. In this case the compensation action is to send another email notifying the recipient of the final outcome. Alternatively, you may have multiple XA (two-phase) aware resources, but due to performance reasons you need to run them in one-phase mode. Maybe you have a combination of transactional and non-transactional work. In this case the transactional work can be rolled back, if required, whilst the non-transactional resources are compensated. Also, you may have transactional resources or services, but, for whatever reason, they will not participate in an existing transaction. This can occur when you try to compose multiple services outside of your control. For example, a travel agent application may compose a transaction of calls to third party services. Providing these services offer an interface for cancelling (compensating) a booking, you should be able to use a compensation-based transaction to coordinate them. If you find yourself needing to coordinate multiple non-transactional tasks, you should consider using compensations. h1. Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much Part 3: Cross-Domain Distributed Transactions h3. Introduction [TODO] When your application becomes distributed, you greatly increase the chances of failure. Many of these failures can be tolerated by using a distributed ACID transaction. However, this approach is often dismissed as impractical for a number of reasons. The first is that distributed transactions tend to take longer to run, due to the increased communication latency. This can cause big problems for your throughput as the duration of held locks greatly increases. The second issue is that all the servers in the distributed transaction become tightly-coupled. Furthermore, the server that begun the transaction has full control over when the transaction should complete (ignoring the option of making a heuristic decision, which is really bad!). This may be acceptable if all the servers reside in the same business domain, but it’s rarely acceptable for cross-business domain applications. Compensation-based transactions can be used to solve both of these problems. The latency imposed by the distributed transaction does not result in holding of locks for extended periods as the work is completed immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the transaction. If this work was a database update, it would be committed immediately. A second database update would be made to undo the change, should compensation be required. Compensation-based transactions also encourage a loosely-coupled architecture as each participant offers a more natural interface to the coordinator. For example, in a flight booking example, the service interface would consist of ‘bookFlight’ and ‘cancelFlight’ operations (‘cancel’ being the compensating action). h1. Compensating Transactions: When ACID is too much Part 4: Long Lived Transactions (LLT) h3. Introduction [TODO] h6. ACID transactions are not particularly well suited for transactions that take a long time to run. This is because they acquire locks on resources as they progress and don’t release them until the transaction completes. In the meantime, other transactions, requiring that data, are blocked. Furthermore, a failure of a long running transaction results in the loss of all work completed so far. A compensation-based transaction can be composed of multiple short-lived ACID transactions. When each transaction completes, it releases the locks on the data it held, allowing other transactions, requiring that data, to proceed. A compensation action is registered for each ACID transaction. These actions are invoked, in reverse order, for all completed transactions, should the LLT need to be aborted. Furthermore, should one of these short-lived transactions fail, it could be possible to find an alternative, preventing the entire transaction from failing, and allowing forward progress to be achieved. Also, in some situations, as the transaction progresses, you may decide to abort just part of the transaction. For example, take a travel booking example. We begin by booking a flight. We then try to book a taxi, but that fails. At this point we don’t want to compensate the flight as it may be fully-booked next time we try. Therefore we try to find an alternative Taxi, which in this example succeeds. Later, in the LLT, we may find a cheaper flight, in which case we want to cancel the original flight whilst keeping the taxi and booking the cheaper flight. In this case we notify our intentions to the transaction manager who ensures that the more expensive flight is compensated when the LLT completes. h6. Conclusion In this blog post I’ve introduced the concept of a compensation-based transaction and showed how it could be used to provide strong guarantees in situations that are not applicable for ACID transactions. Most of what is discussed here is already supported through our WS-BA implementation. We are currently in the process of decoupling this technology from Web Services and improving the developer API.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Re: Can I show my apps' knowledge session in the jBPM Console?</header>
    <body>In case anyone is trying to do the same thing, I've got this largely going now.  The big piece I was missing is that the console is just using the logs, so as long as I log to the same DB the console is using (with JPAWorkingMemoryDbLogger) everything pretty much automagically works.  I use either JBPMHelper.newStatefulKnowledgeSession(kbase) (if I start from my app) or JBPMHelper.loadStatefulKnowledgeSession(kbase, sessionId) if I want to use the knowledge session started from the Console.  Also, I don't dispose of the session of course if I am borowing the Console's.  I read somewhere that you can give the session a business id (and soon do the same from your own code so that they automatically use the same session), but currently I have a kludge that just assume the highest session is the one from the Console (if I want to borrow that one). Hope that helps someone. -J</body>

    <body>I am having trouble with a JBPM workflow where the StaleObjectStateException is being thrown while processing the "end" of a workflow process. In this instance we are running JBPM 3.2.7 We have gone round and round with this problem, trying to see what is causing the issue.  The worst thind that happens when this occurs to us, is that the workflow process starts itself over again at the start task.  This looping is causing a major headache. Does anyone have any thoughts about what may be causing the looping or the error in the first place. Let me know if there are more relevant details that you may need for this. Also of note, this occurs when I process a single transaction at a time in the system.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Historical queries in Jbpm5</header>
    <body>Hi All, i am evaluating jbpm5 for our project purpose. i am building a test workflow solution that involves "processInstance per process definition" approach. for each new ProcessInstance , a Pojo model is stored as process variable and persistence is enabled . deployment mechanism is "web-application" deployed in tomcat. There is an admin page , where i want to provide a search functionality based on attributes of  "Pojo model" stored as process variable. for example "Job Pojo" stored as process variable has tow attributes "creation date" and "finished date" , and "status (current state it is in)" and  i want to perform a query: "get all process instances with creationDate &gt; 'date1' and  finishedDate' &lt;  'date2' and  status == "confirmEmployee (which is aprocess defn task node)" . admin can perform any search query based on attributes of  "process varaible pojo". how to achieve this in Jbpm5 ?. thanks Mayank Sahai</body>

    <body>I'm new to jBPM and trying to understanding the implementation options of the Human Task Service. From my understanding I can expose the Human Task Service via a web service for external applications. I'm wondering if I can do the following:      - Deploy/package the Human Task Service with my core jBPM project so both the Human Task Service and Process Engine run in the same JVM.      - Use the LocalHTWorkItemHandler from within my core jBPM project to interact with the Human Task Service.      - Invoke the same Human Task Service via a web service from additional external applications. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Re: Internal and External	Human Task Service</header>
    <body>Hi, In that case you need two things, 1) You can have your local task service running with LocalHTWorkItemHandler that will work fine 2) Then you need to have a task service exposed via a transport (Web Services for example) and make sure that the server is also associated with the session that is running the processes, so they can be notified if a task is completed via the Task Service that is exposed via web services. Notice that you have 2 task services, but they share the database, so they share the state. Cheers</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Management Layer	Access Control</header>
    <body>Role based access control to the AS7 management layer. *Core Concepts* * * When defining an RBAC model, the following conventions are useful: * Subject = A person or automated agent * Role = Job function or title which defines an authority level * Permissions = An approval of a mode of access to a resource * Action = An operation to execute on a resource * Constraint: Predicate that makes the permission valid in the context of the system state * Session = A mapping involving Subject, Role and/or Permissions https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-47854-31-19855/PermissonModel2.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-47854-31-19855/450-235/PermissonModel2.png *Generic Requirements* * Provide a usable (in terms of complexity), yet comprehensive base model * Provide a set of out-of-the-box roles &amp; permissons that reflect common authorization requirements * Enable customizations/extension of the default scheme (i.e custom permissions, permission granularity) * Provide management operations to retrieve session information (i.e. roles assigned, permissions granted, etc) * Clearly distinguish security exceptions from other operation errors (i.e. custom response headers) * Mappability with existing authorisation schemes (i.e. JON) *Specific Requirements* * +Support permission enforcement that restricts visibility of model elements: +Control visibility of resources (i.e. restrict visibility of server groups) * +Support permission enforcement that restricts execution on model elements+: Control execution on resources (i.e. lock down certain operations, distinguish read &amp; read/write access) * +The management layer needs to enforce permission regardless of the client type and availability: +I.e. enformenent can not be delegated to the client only+ + * +Clients (CLI, Web) should indicate permissions prior to execution of management operations:+ I.e. grey out interface elements to emphasis lack of permissions * JMX access that isn't delegated to the ModelController needs to be covered by the permission scheme as well *Use cases* See  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47856 RBACUsecases* * *Advanced Topics* - Context based access control: i.e. Taking the connection into consideration - Support for role hierarchies: i.e. structuring roles to reflect an organizations lines of authority and responsibility - Role constraints: i.e. mutual exclusive roles - RBAC to manage RBAC itself - Ability to hide the existence of a resource altogether, vs the ability to show its existence but hide its content.    The issue here is in some cases the address of the resource itself may provide sensitive information,    e.g. security-realm=ManagementRealm structuring roles to re  ect an organiza   tion  s lines of authority and resp onsibility</body>

    <body>You are pointing to the right place ! i resolved this problem and i remember that i had to instanciate a new kbuilder, a new  kbase ,a new  env , a new  emf for the session to reload as it is a new created session and even a new client for dealing with tasks. here is the code :                // Let's reload the session                   // All the listeners and WorkItemHandlers are volatile, so we need to register them each time that we reload the session                   //  from the DB.                                         // TODO Auto-generated catch block</body>

    <body>To stop a process instance, you need to stop the included human tasks as well. The session information is stored by jbpm in the table SESSIONINFO. You can load the session using JPAKnowledgeService.loadSess......... ﻿But creating a new session each time is not a costly process. So you can do that instead but keep the knowledge base alive.</body>

    <body>Hi guys, First post. I am trying to invoke a service using a StaticWireTap and I have noticed that the wiretap only happens if the calling service's scope is invmScope=Global set. If I remove the 'invmScope=Global' the wiretapped Service does not get called. Reading the documentation there is no indication that a WireTap service has to be called from a in-vm service. Can anyone shed some light on this? Thanks.</body>

Could you attach the server log for identifying the issue furtehr. You can have a look at the security_jbpm quickstart, where it is used without the 'invmScope=Global'.</body>

    <body>Thanks Tom, Yes please! The question is about the following sequence where after the transaction is committed: 1) The container will first invoke the JPA persistence provider as indicated by this first callback: 2) Which is then followed by a second callback (JTA related this time) from the container: The questions: - Is this order defined by JBoss? - Can this order be modified?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Re: EnityManager.close() before or after JTA afterCompletion()?</header>
    <body>Hi Seyvet, If you look at those two stack traces you can see a common line: at com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.TwoPhaseCoordinator.afterCompletion(TwoPhaseCoordinator.java:402) The only ordering that can be guaranteed is for interposed synchronizations (registered by the TransactionSynchronizationRegistry): http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/transaction/TransactionSynchronizationRegistry.html#registerInterposedSynchronization%28javax.transaction.Synchronization%29 http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/transaction/TransactionSynchronizationRegistry.html#registerInterposedSynchronization%28javax.transaction.Synchronization%29 There was a little mistype in my original response which I will now refactor in the original to say: ... foreach ResourceManager    rm::commit() foreach InterposedSynchronization foreach Synchronization i.e. When it comes to afterCompletion, interposed synchronizations will be called *first* which is one way (if you only have two synchronizations  ;)  ) to guarentee order.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [EJB3 Development] - How to package EJB	interface for JBoss AS 7</header>
    <body>I'm migrating to JBoss AS 7 from JBoss AS 5.  I've read JBoss AS 7 Class Loading mechanism and although I feel I understood it, I have a hard time packaging my jar and war for JBoss AS 7.  Here is the scenario: 1. I have an EJB interface named IRepository 2. And an EJB class that implements that interface, named Repository 3. This EJB will be looked up, using JNDI, as a local bean by a web application which is packaged as a separate .war file. 4. I'm also using Maven for building and packaging my .jar and .war files The questions I have are: 1. Should I package IRepository in a .jar (say irepository.jar) separate from the jar that contains Repository EJB class? - If I do this I believe I can reference irepository.jar as a dependency in my .war file's MANIFEST.  This is fine, except that it increases the number of Maven projects I have by 1 to build irepository.jar 2. Should I package IRepository and Repository EJB in the same jar (say repositoryejb.jar) AND NOT including this jar in my .war (using Maven 'provided' scope)? - If I do this and I put repositoryejb.jar in modules/.../main JBoss 7 doesn't display JNDI information about this EJB, which makes me believe that my web app may not be able to look up this EJB - If I just deploy repositoryejb.jar in the standalone/deployments directory, JBoss 7 displays JNDI information about this EJB.  But how do I specify that my .war depends on repositoryejb.jar?  Basically, my .war does not know what IRepository is to cast a looked up EJB to a variable within my web app 3. Should I package IRepository and Repository EJB in the same jar AND including this jar in my .war (using Maven 'compiled' scope)? - This would ensure that my web app can cast a looked up EJB to IRepository.  But when I deploy my .war to JBoss AS 7 it discovers a different EJB (in war scope) and provides different JNDI information. This is just not clean. It seems that the answer is straight forward, but maybe my head is stuck in the sand that I can see a good answer.  Thanks in advance for the help.</body>

    <body>Hello All, Sorry for this Newbie question, but it's my first time deploying webservices on jboss. I have successfully deployed my webservice to jboss (No webservice deployment errors when I start jboss), but I can't seem to figure out how to access the service from the browser. I've tried going to localhost:8080/jbossws under registered webservices, but did not see anything there. I see in the jmx console under the web.deployment the .war file for my webservice is listed there. I've also tried browsing to the url for my webservice listed in the wsdl, but got a page not found error. I'm not sure what else I should check. Any help is appreciated!! Thanks in Advance!!</body>

    <body>I wanted to post an update since no one responded to my question. Even though I entered a url in my webservice wsdl, it was not the url used when I run the webservice in the eclipse IDE. I found that there's a file, org.eclipse.wst.common.component, that has the wb-module listing the deploy-name. I used this name in my url "localhost:8080/deploy-name/webservicename" and I was able to access it. This still doesn't explain why I am unable to see the service under the registered services in jboss. Anyone reading this post, if you have a link to instructions on how to setup the registered services in jboss, please post the link. Thanks in advance!</body>

I'm using jBPM 5.4 deployed in my own JBOSS AS 7.1.1 and persisting in postgres. The process is deployed in Guvnor and it all works fine, persistance is working and I can do all the required operations via my ESB. The problem is that I was using AsyncHornetQHTWorkItemHandler as work item handler and the tasks would'nt move forward when the previous was completed. Then I changed the handler to CommandBasedHornetQWSHumanTaskHandler and it works fine, the problem is that class is deprecated so I should'nt use it and I can't find an alternative for that. I have a workflow of this type: Start ---&gt; Human Task ---&gt; Script Task ---&gt; Human Task ---&gt; Human Task ---&gt; Human Task ---&gt; End This is the code I'm using, note that this is working fine but using the deprecated class:      ksession = JPAKnowledgeService.newStatefulKnowledgeSession(kbase, null, env);    *CommandBasedHornetQWSHumanTaskHandler* humanTaskHandler = new *CommandBasedHornetQWSHumanTaskHandler*(ksession);        As this is a big project I should'nt use a deprecated class, can you help me on this?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Integration Tooling	Release Process</header>
    <body>h1. Overview This document details the process for building and releasing composite/aggregate update sites for the JBoss integration tooling (formerly SOA tools). h2. Goals * Provide a light-weight process with minimal overhead for component owners. * Provide an ever-current update site containing the latest, stable releases of integration tooling components. * Allow component owners to independently manage their release schedules. * Allow component owners to manage their own dependency stack. h2. Assumptions * Components use released versions of dependencies (i.e. stable builds). * Component owners manage their own interdependencies with other integration components. * Components and dependencies adhere to Eclipse API versioning rules. h2. Implications * Aggregate releases will be driven by component releases. * Aggregate releases should manage themselves. * Component nightly/milestone builds should always be compatible with other components in the aggregate. h1. Definitions * *Integration Stack (IS)* - all JBoss middleware integration tooling * *IS configuration* - the definition of specific components and versions that make up the IS * *IS build* - an update site (p2 repo) aggregating specific versions of integration tooling components. * *Release types:** *stable* - an IS build aggregating stable (i.e. final) builds of all components that has been certified/tested by QA. * *development* - an IS build aggregating stable builds of all components that has not been certified/tested by QA. * *integration* - an IS build aggregating stable, development (e.g. beta) and/or integration builds of all components * *next* - an internal IS build incorporating the latest integration builds of all components (i.e. the current "trunk" build).  This will be used for identifying potential future incompatibilities. Stable builds will align  with a JBDS release in the same way JBT core builds do today.  Development builds will reflect the current state of all stable components.  Theoretically, any development build could be QA'd and promoted to stable (assuming no test failures).  Integration builds allow for an "interim" stack which may be useful during a QA cycle (e.g. verifying a fix that requires updates to multiple components; a single component can be updated via the component update site).  Next builds are used to identify potential incompatiblilities among components before they are integrated into a release and would occur weekly/monthly via a Hudson job (e.g. targeting JBT integration builds). An IS build only needs to occur when the IS configuration changes.  Because the IS stack is composed of stable components, configuration changes will only occur when individual components are released.  For this reason, it is assumed the build would be invoked manually. h1. Roles and Responsibilities h2. Component Owners 1. *Component update site:*  Component owners must provide an update site for each release of their component that is included in an IS build. 2. *Updating IS configuration:*  Component owners must update the IS build configuration when a new version of their component is released.  This ensures the IS is up-to-date. 3. *Respond to change requests:*  Component owners must review IS configuration change requests and respond in a timely manner.  If a requested change is incompatible with the current version of your component, provide details regarding when your component will be compatible, along with a patch containing changes to the IS configuration for your compatible release. h2. Release Engineers 1. *Maintain build infrastructure:*  Release engineers will be responsible for maintianing the build infrastructure, primarily the Jenkins jobs. 2. *Processing pull requests:*  Release engineers will be responsible processing all pull requests related to IS configuration.  This is to ensure consistency in the composition of the stack (e.g. components, component versions, IS version, etc.). 3. *Initiate IS builds:*  Release engineers will be responsible for initiating IS builds. 4. *Build promotion:*  Release engineers will be responsible for the promotion of IS builds (e.g. from development to stable). h1. Release Process h2. Component Updates The following outlines the basic process for updating the IS configuration.  Typically, this would occur when a component is released, but the same process is also used for updating shared dependencies (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins, etc.). 1. Create branch in user repository for IS configuration changes. 2. Update IS configuration for updates, e.g. update URL for SwitchYard from 0.5.0.Final to 0.6.0.Final; update IS version from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (see versioning rules)1. Modify the compositeArtifacts.xml and compositeContent.xml files (in aggregate-site) to point to the new update site. 2. Modify the category.xml file (in aggregate-site) as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify project version (pom.xml in aggregate-site). 4. For changes to dependencies:1. Modify base.target or community.target (in target-platform) 2. Modify project version (pom.xml in target-platform) 3. Ensure plugins are mirrored on jboss.org 3. Build locally to validate stack dependencies. 4. Create JIRA task requesting update, e.g. update SwitchYard to 0.6.0.Final* Include link to github branch in task * Include build  results (e.g. SUCCESS or specific dependency resolution errors) 5. Create subtasks against each IS component for verification/approval* For components that failed the consistency check, mark subtasks appropriately, e.g. m2e-wtp version is inconsistent 6. Merge any changes required by other components from subtasks (e.g. update Savara to 2.1.0.Final) 7. Build IS locally to validate dependency consistency 8. Issue pull request against upstream IS configuration project 9. Process pull (by release engineer) 10. Invoke build job (by release engineer) h2. Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS  within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. Dependency Updates The process for updating a shared dependency is the same as that for updating any other component, with the following additions: 1. Make sure the dependency is mirrored on jboss.org. 2. Make sure the dependency is not already included through JBT core. If a dependency is included through JBT core, you will need to coordinate with the core team on the upgrade, as the change may impact components outside the IS. h2. Versioning Rules - major.minor.update.build *Major* should be updated for: * Base platform changes, e.g. Eclipse Indigo-&gt;Juno, JBT 3.3-&gt;4.0 * Major component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 1.0-&gt;2.0 *Minor* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5-&gt;0.6 *Update* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5.0-&gt;0.5.1 *Build* should be updated for each build, e.g. when building against nightly/integration/development repositories ** Note, the basic assumption here is that components are adhering to basic API rules (per Eclipse; e.g. minor includes bug fixes and api additions, major may include breaking api changes). h1. Update Site Locations * *Integration builds:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Development builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Stable builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* h1. Infrastructure * *JIRA -*  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS * *Source -*  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack* *target-platform* - provides a target platform defining all upstream dependencies for use by IS components (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins) * *aggregate-site* - provides category and feature definitions for the IS update site * *Jenkins* -</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [EJB3 Development] - Google Support for EJB</header>
    <body>Hello. I have been testing for the first time enterprise java beans and I have to say I like it mainly because of the simplicity in implementating the logic layer, apart of the model and the view. But any away... EJB works on google app engine partially becouse methods on the facelts get invoked but the attributes get lost between page refresh for instances. I already launch a thread on stack overflow that explains the issue. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14740847/session-bean-gets-lost-in-gae-using-jsf-and-primefaces http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14740847/session-bean-gets-lost-in-gae-using-jsf-and-primefaces But the real reason for google app engine to claim oficial that doesn't handle EJB is becouse it can not store java objects in session. For instances: this would not save the attribute into session. I suspect that EJB does something that reseambles this. Ok... So I was thinking if it is possible to serialize the class attributes using for instance JSON as I did in the previous mentioned StackOverflow thread (but in other context), and store the string in session. And retrive the string, parsing and building the Bean when it is necessary... I don't know if such a think is possible... Thanks in advance and thank you for your time.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Layered Distributions and Module Path Organization</header>
    <body>h1. +*This proposal is slightly WIP*+ h1. Overview This document describes notions for how different software distributions based on the JBoss AS 7 project can integrate with the base AS and with each other in a controlled manner. +* *+ h1. Fundamental Concepts h2. Distribution A coherent set of software produced by a "project" or a "product". JBoss AS 7 is a project. JBoss EAP is such a product. Both play similar technical roles in the JBoss ecosystem, but there are significant differences in how the two are made available to end users. This article uses "distribution" as a replacement for constantly saying "project/product" everywhere. It's not a great term; if someone has a better one, please suggest it. h2. Distribution Base The "distribution base" is the core set of modules, bundles and miscellaneous files that is common to all layered distributions. It may itself be usable standalone project or product. Currently the software produced by the JBoss AS 7 project and the JBoss EAP product are the distribution bases relevant to this discussion. In the future a more limited subset of functionality may become the distribution base, with the full set of functionality currently provided in community AS and EAP coming as layered distributions or add-ons. h2. Layered Distribution A distribution that builds on top of the distribution base, potentially superceding some of the distribution base's functionality. A layered distribution is allowed to supercede any aspect of the distribution base's functionality. The less the layered distribution does this, the easier it will be for the layered distribution to manage things like patching, but, if necessary, a layered distribution can supercede anything in the distribution base. A layered distribution build on top of another layered distribution, provided it has worked out the necessary procedures to ensure compatibility. h2. Identity An identity is a named set of distribution base + layered distribution(s) that is certified as a valid combination. The distribution base by itself may or may not be a valid identity. Currently it is; in the future it may not be. The software produced by a given layered distribution may be associated with more than one identity. h3. Patching and Identities Patches are applicable to an identity. A given patch can apply to more than one identity, if there are no conflicts between the identities in terms of how they use the items modified by a patch. The metadata associated with a patch will indicate the identities to which it is applicable. Patches are comprised of one or more discrete +patch elements+ each of which is produced by the distribution base or by one of the layered distributions associated with the identity. A patch element includes metadata describing the element along with any added or modified files. The patch element metadata will identify the provider of the patch component. A given patch element can be used in multiple different patches. For example, a patch element upgrading the distribution base can be included in several patches produced by different identities, with each patch also including a patch element upgrading a layered distribution used in that identity. For example, let's say an identity named I consists of the distribution base and a layered distribution named A. Version 1.0 of identity I is based on version 2.0 of the distribution base and version 1.0 of layered distribution A. The distribution base produces a patch element that will move it to version 2.1. The producers of the I identity could then produce a patch that will result in version 1.1 of identity A. This would include a patch element upgrading layered distribution A to its version 1.1, as well as the separate element that provides the distribution base upgrade to its 2.1. There are two main benefits of this sharing approach: * The modules and bundles provided by the distribution base upgrade are associated with the original 2.1 patch provided by the distribution base, not just with the enclosing patch provided by A. This will make possible the sharing of modules/bundles provided by patches across installations. * Incorporating one patch within another as a simple discrete unit helps avoid errors during patch production. For modules and bundles within a patch, once the patch is applied the association of the module or bundle with the distribution base or layer that provided it is retained within the installation. The association is encoded within the filesystem path that points to the patch version of the module or bundle. Miscellaneous files within a patch are not associated with the distribution base or any particular layered distribution once they are installed. For example bin/standalone.sh is bin/standalone.sh no matter what patch component added or modified it. Each identity produces a patch stream. Because a given patch can apply to more than one identity, the same patch can appear in multiple patch streams. The distribution base and layered distributions can produces +patch elements+ but they cannot themselves produce +patches+ or a patch stream. Since a patch must be associated with an an identity, only an identity (or a group of cooperating identities) can produce a patch. If there is an identity that consists of nothing but the distribution base, that identity can produce a patch. But this is logically not the same thing as saying the distribution base itself produced the patch, even though the practical effect is similar. h2. Installation An installation is a single filesystem location containing the distribution base plus zero or more layered distributions. It includes the bin/ dir from which processes are launched. The root of the installation is the path indicated by the $JBOSS_HOME environment variable referred to in the scripts and indicated by the jboss.home.dir system property used in the java code. h3. Installation Identity Each installation has a *+single identity+*. Because an installation only has a single identity, there is no confusion as to which layered distribution "owns" a particular filesystem location in that installation. Further, because the identity of an installation can be easily determined (see "Establishing Identity" below), external tools can quickly understand the functionality provided by a given installation, even if no process is currently running from the installation. +TODO further spell out the importance of single identity.+ h3. Sharing Files Across Installations+ + The files that comprise modules and bundles are potentially sharable across installations. Making it easy for users to do this should be a key goal. Miscellaneous files are not sharable across installations. An end user could potentially share them using symlinks, but doing so is not a supported feature nor is it a recommended practice. Patches are not sharable across installations. The +modules and bundles that the patch provides+ are potentially sharable, but the miscellaneous files provided by a patch are not sharable. The patching history metadata that the patching tool records in the installation is also not sharable -- the metadata is associated with the given installation. However, making it easy to share the the modules and bundles provide by a patch across installations should be a key goal. h2. Add-On Distribution An add-on distribution is a set of software that extends the capabilities of a given "identity". An add-on can only extend capabilities. It is not allowed to supercede capabilities of the identity it extends. For modules and OSGi bundles, the module and bundle loading logic provided by the distribution base will enforce this behavior. For miscellaneous files, it is up to the people providing an add-on to ensure that the add-on does not overwrite any file provided by the distribution base, any layered distribution associated with the identity or any other add-ons associated with the identity. Conversely, once the providers of an identity have accepted an add-on into their ecosystem, it is their responsibility to ensure that they do not add any files to their distributions that will conflict with files already provided by the add-on. In practice, the most likely sources of conflict will be the xml files in the configuration directories and the .conf files in the bin directory. Conflicts over xml files are solvable by having add-on providers ship their own xml file variants rather than attempting to modify the standard ones that ship with the identity. A given add-on is allowed to extend the capabilities of more than one identity. An add-on may require the presence of other add-ons. h3. Patching and Add-ons Add-on distributions produce their own patch stream. The patches produced by an add-on indicate the versions of the identity that must be present for the patch to apply. More than one identity can be listed, since add-ons may be applicable to multiple identities. The patches produced by an add-on also indicate the existing version of the add-on that must be present, as well as the version of any other required add-ons. Add-ons cannot use patches in their own stream to fix problems in the identity on which they depend. Add-ons depend on the patch stream provided by their dependent identity to provide such fixes. Modules and bundles provided by an add-on or its patches will have lower precedence in the module loading order than those that come from the distribution base or layered distributions, so any fix to such a module/bundle provided by an add-on patch will have no effect. h1. Installers +TODO discussion of RPM+ h2. Distribution Base Installers The distribution base can be installed via a simple unzip. If the distribution base is itself an identity, see also "Identity Installers" h2. Identity Installers An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that already contains a depended upon identity or the installation base of a zip that only includes the layered distribution(s) to be added. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an identity is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is irrevocably changed.+* When an identity is installed it has the right to modify any miscellaneous files in the installation filesystem, so once an identity is installed, the identity of the installation is changed. In many (hopefully nearly all) cases it may be possible for a user to remove files added by an identity install and get the installation back to its previous identity, but doing this is not a supported feature of the software and is not a recommended practice. *+However, once support for installing patches via the patching tool is available, reverting an identity installation will be possible.+* The patching tool maintains backup copies of any miscellaneous files modified by a patch, making it possible to restore those files. h2. Add-on Installer An identity can be installed via: * An unzip onto an empty filesystem location of a zip file that includes the distribution base and all layered distributions along with the add-on itself. * An unzip onto a filesystem location that contains the depended upon identity of a zip that only includes the add-on. * An installer program that does one or the other or both of the above and also provides a user interface that allows the user to customize the installation. It is a goal but not an initial requirement to allow installation to be performed via the patching tool. The benefit of this is the patching tool incorporates a number of compatibility checks that can help a user avoid invalid combinations. A further goal is to make the logic contained in the patching tool available to installer programs via a library. *+Once an add-on is installed into a given filesystem location, the identity of that installation is not changed, and it must be possible to reverse the installation.+* An add-on is merely additive, so removing it is a matter of deleting what was added. This could be done via a script provided by the add-on, via an installer program, or manually by a user following a set of instructions. h1. Establishing Identity It +must+ be possible for external tools to determine the identity of a given installation without requiring the software based on that installation to be running. It's also necessary for the software based on an installation to determine its own identity. The identity of an installation is provided via the bin/product.conf file located in the distribution. The product.conf file is a simple properties file that contains the following property: slot=&lt;simple string name for identity&gt; For example: slot=eap The value of "slot" is used by the running software to identify the "slot" portion of the identifier of a jboss-modules module. The software uses the slot to load a module named org.jboss.as.product:&lt;value of slot property&gt;, e.g. org.jboss.as.product:eap. The software will then read manifest properties included in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file located in that module to find out other identifying information for the identity. Currently supported manfiest properties include: * JBoss-Product-Release-Name -- Provides the name of the identity for use in the management API and in places like the startup and shutdown log messages. * JBoss-Product-Release-Version -- Provides the version of the identity for use in the management API and in places like the startup and shutdown log messages. * JBoss-Product-Console-Slot -- Used to drive what variant of the management console should be loaded. The notion here is there are different streams of consoles being produced, one for community AS releases and one for product releases, differentiated primarily by cosmetic differences. This property drives which of the two streams of console releases should be used when the console module is loaded. The use of "Slot" in this property name is a bit unfortunate since it implies an implementation detail that may very well change. The name of the property may change in a future minor release of the AS or EAP and will very likely change in the next major release. If no bin/product.conf file exists, the installation is assumed to be the community version of the distribution base. If the product.conf file contains other properties besides slot, the software will use those properties to set system properties in the runtime. However, the properties in the file will not take precedence over other mechanisms for setting system properties (i.e. the command line, the standard scripts or the xml configuration files.) Note also that the reading of product.conf occurs after primordial boot, so this mechanism should not be used for setting properties needed immediately on launch. The values are unknown to the JVM launcher, will be unknown to jboss-modules when it sets up the modular classloading environment, and will be unknown to the logging system until any logging subsystem in the xml configuration file is processed. The software based on the installation will also need to know the name of any layered distributions used by the identity, in order of the precedence to be used when loading their modules and/or bundles. This information will be done via a modules/layers.conf file located in the distribution. This file will be a simple properties file that includes a single property: layers=&lt;comma delimited list of layered distribution names with earlier names taking precedence&gt; For example, assuming we have layered distribution named "soa" and "brms" with "brms" taking precedence over "soa": layers=brms,soa There is no need to include "base" in the list of layers; if not present "base" will be appended to the list of layers as the lowest precedence layer. It is legal to include "base" in the list, though. If the modules/layers.conf file does not exist or no layered distributions are named in it, only the base and any add-ons will be used. h1. Module Loading JBoss AS currently loads modules based on a "module path" which is a list of filesystem locations which JBoss Modules searches for modules. In our standard launch scripts, users are able to manipulate this module path by setting the $JBOSS_MODULEPATH environment variable. If not set, $JBOSS_MODULEPATH is set to $JBOSS_HOME/modules. This mechanism creates a single default location under which modules can be located. This is problematic when layered distributions and add-ons wish to install their own modules, since there are no clear rules as to how those modules should be installed or how they relate to one another. h2. Goals * To make it easy for layered distributions or add-ons to add their modules to the set of available modules or remove their modules from the set of available modules, without fear of physically overwriting modules provided by others. * To establish clear rights and responsibilities for providers of the distribution base, layered distributions and add-ons with respect to how their modules should be managed. * To establish clear rules for how distributions that add modules that must take precedence over other modules provided by other distributions with the same name and slot should:* locate those modules * indicate at launch time to the modular classloading system the precedence order * To make it easy for end users to alter the module path for their own purposes by setting $JBOSS_MODULEPATH without needing to concern themselves with details of how the modules provided by the distribtuion base, layered distributions, or add-ons relate to one another. Reserve the use of $JBOSS_MODULEPATH and the value of the -mp command line argument passed to jboss-modules for end use uses. h2. Rights and Responsibilities of Module Providers All modules provided as part of the distribution base can be depended upon by any add-on associated with an identity. If the distribution base by itself is an identity (i.e. with no additional layered distribution required), the providers of the distribution base accept the following with respect to that identity: * The version of the module the distribution base provides will take precedence over a module with the same name and slot provided by any add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch will need to be tested for compatibility with add-ons based on the version of the identity being patched. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the distribution base cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the distribution base itself no longer needs that module. If the distribution base is part of an identity along with one or more layered distributions, the providers of the distribution base accept the following with respect to that identity: * The distribution base has the same responsibilities with respect to add-ons that it has in the case of add-ons without any layered distribution. * However, if a layered distribution in an identity provides a module with the same name and slot as the one provided by the distribution base, the distribution base no longer has responsibility to provide the module. The layered distribution's version of the module takes precedence. * The distribution base can modify a module that is depended upon by a layered distribution in a way that breaks functionality of the layered distribution. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the distribution base before making them available for use with the identity. If the distribution base patch element in some way breaks the functionality of an identity, either the patch element should not be provided for the identity, or the patch that incorporates the distribution base patch element should also include a layered distribution patch element that fixes the problem.* However, the distribution base should take great care not to break layered distributions with which it is associated when it produces patch elements. Distribution base patch element production should involve reasonable testing of all relevant identities such that problems can be found and resolved before the distribution base patch element ships. * The distribution base can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on but which is depended upon by a layered distribution. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the distribution base before making them available for use with the identity. If the distribution base removes a module depended upon by a layered distribution, the patch that incorporates the distribution base patch element should also include a layered distribution patch element that adds the module as part of the layered distribution. * If an identity add-on depends on a module provided by the distribution base and the distribution base wishes to remove the module, that is allowed provided some layered distribution is willing to begin providing the same module in an overall patch. All modules provided as part of a layered distribution can be depended upon by any add-on associated with an identity. They cannot be depended upon by the distribution base. When a layered distribution includes a module it accepts the following: * The version of the module it provides will take precedence over a module with the same name and slot provided by the distribution base or by any add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of that module in a patch element will need to be tested for compatibility with add-ons based on that version of the identity. Any functionality provided by the distribution base and supported by the identity will also have to be tested. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the layered distribution cannot remove a module that is depended upon by an add-on, even if the layered distribution itself no longer needs that module. * A layered distribution can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on. If a layered distribution participates in an identity with another layered distribution that depends on it, the depended-on layer accepts the following: * If the dependent layered distribution provides a module with the same name and slot as the one provided by the depended-on layer, the depended-on layer no longer has responsibility to provide the module to the dependent or to any add-ons. The dependent layered distribution's version of the module takes precedence. * The depended-on layer can modify a module that is depended upon by another layer in a way that breaks functionality of the dependent. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by the component layers before making them available for use with the identity. If the depended-on layer's patch element in some way breaks the functionality of an identity, either the patch should not be provided for the identity, or the patch element that incorporates the depended-on layer's patch component should also include a patch element to a dependent layer that fixes the problem.* However, a depended-on layer should take great care not to break dependent layers when it produces patch elements. Layered distribution patch production should involve reasonable testing of all relevant identities such that problems can be found and resolved before the depended-on layer's patch ships. * A depended-on layer can remove a module that is not depended upon by any add-on but which is depended upon by another layer. Providers of identities that include layered distributions are responsible for testing patch elements produced by a depended-upon layered distribution before making them available for use with the identity. If the depended-upon layer removes a module that is depended upon by another layer, the patch that incorporates the depended-upon layer's patch element should also include a patch element from the dependent layer distribution that adds the module as part of that layered distribution. * If an add-on depends on a module provided by the layered distribution and the layered distribution wishes to remove the module, that is allowed provided some other layered distribution in the identity is willing to begin providing the same module in an overall patch. When an add-on includes a module, it accepts the following with respect to any identity with which the add-on is associated: * The distribution base or a layered distribution may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*will*+ take precedence over the module provided by the add-on. * Another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and that module +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by this layered distribution or add-on. * Another add-on may ship a module with the same name and slot, and the version provided by this layered distribution or add-on +*may*+ take precedence over the module provided by the other add-on. * As a consequence of this, any modification of the depended-upon module in a patch element will need to be tested for compatibility with any add-on based on the same major version of the identity.* The providers of the add-on are responsible for providing an adequate set of tests to the providers of the identity. * The distribution base or a layered distribution cannot depend upon a module provided by an add-on. * As a consequence of the previous point, an add-on can remove a module in a patch, without fear of breaking the core functionality of an identity. * An add-on can depend up a shareable module provided by another add-on upon which it depends, but +only with the express consent of the providers of that add-on+. Such dependencies are strongly discouraged. * If an add-on allows another add-on to depend upon its modules, it takes on the following responsibilities:* Any modification of that module in a patch or version upgrade will need to be tested for compatibility with any dependent add-ons. Testing procedures must be created to ensure that any patches produced by the depended-upon add-on do not break the dependent add-on. * As a subset of the previous point, within a major version family the add-on cannot remove a module that is depended upon by another add-on, even if the add-on itself no longer needs that module. h2. Module Organization on the Filesystem This section will describe how the above points are reflected in the actual organization of modules on the filesystem. h4. Requirement for Standardized Module Loading JBoss Modules can support other mechanisms for finding module content and loading it besides the filesystem-based module path mechanism. Theoretically a custom boot module loader implementation could be specified at process launch, with that module loader using some other means for locating module content. This article proposes that this capability be declared as unsupported for JBoss AS and products based upon it. Rather, the AS will have a specified boot module loader implementation. Users of the AS community project are free to use a non-standard boot module loader implementation, but if they do so and certain features provided by the AS don't work, that is their problem. h3. Filesystem Layout Modules would be organized on the filesystem as follows: modules + system ++ add-ons +++ abc +++ def ++ layers +++ base +++ vuw +++ xyz The system level exists to separate modules associated with the distribution base, layered distribution or add-ons from those the end user may store in the modules directory. +(Note: in earlier versions of this document, "internal" was used instead of "system" with a request for suggestions of something better.)+ h3. Translation of Filesystem Layout into Module Loading Precedence For any location provided by the user via the -mp switch, the module loader will look for the system structure. The module loader will understand the structure above and will apply module loading precedence rules as follows. Assume the above structure exists under $JBOSS_HOME and that the user sets $JBOSS_MODULEPATH as follows JBOSS_MODULESPATH=/user/me/my-modules;$JBOSS_HOME/modules In addition, the bin/product.conf file declares that the identity of the install is xyz, the xyz layered distribution should be loaded and the xyz layered distribution depends on the vuw layered distribution. Assume also that patches named base-1, abc-1, def-1, vuw-1, xyz-1 and xyz-2 have been applied. The module loader would look for modules on the filesystem in following locations, starting with first and terminating as soon as the module is found: /user/me/my-modules /modules (in case the user placed modules directly in under this directory) /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-1 /modules/system/layers/xyz /modules/system/layers/vuw/patches/vuw-1 /modules/system/layers/vuw /modules/system/layers/base/patches/base-1 /modules/system/layers/base /modules/system/add-ons/abc/patches/abc-1 /modules/system/add-ons/abc /modules/system/add-ons/def/patches/def-1 /modules/system/add-ons/def The precedence order between /modules/system/add-ons/abc and /modules/system/add-ons/def is arbitrary. An add-on should never assume its modules will take precedence over those of any other add-on's modules. The fact that the various patches locations are included in the path is entirely due to +metadata+ that the patching tool will store in the $JBOSS_HOME/patches directory. The mere presence of a directory like /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 is insufficient to trigger inclusion of that directory in the module search path. However, when the patching tool installs the patch, the actual location of the +module contents+ will be in /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 -- only patching related metadata will be stored in $JBOSS_HOME/patches. This behavior is important for allowing sharing of modules across installations. h2. Sharing Modules Across Installations The above behavior makes it relatively straightforward for a user to share modules across installations. For example, the user could set up a shared module repo in /user/me with the following structure jboss-module-repo + add-ons ++ abc ++ def + layers ++ base ++ vuw ++ xyz The $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system location in each installation on the filesystem could then be replaced with a symlink to /user/me/jboss-module-repo. The downside to this very simple sharing is the abc and def add-ons will be visible and used by all installations, whether or not they are relevant to the installation's identity. A solution to this problem would be to do more symlinks: $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/layers -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/layers $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/add-ons/abc -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/abc $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system/add-ons/def -&gt; /user/me/jboss-module-repo/add-ons/def As an improvement at some point we could define some sort of file format (say xml) and allow a file with that format to be placed in $JBOSS_HOME/modules/system in lieu of the subdirectories. The file would include all of the mapping information for the external repo. The boot module loader, patching tool and any programmatic installers would know how to read and update that file. The file would only include information for the add-ons relevant to the installation. h3. Implications for the Patching Tool The possibility of module sharing doesn't remove the requirement to apply a patch to each installation on a given filesystem. Applying the patch to each installation is required in order to: *  update any miscellaneous files * record the patching metadata for the particular installation * allow the patching tool to understand what combinations of layered distributions and add-ons are relevant to the given installation However, the patching tool should recognize the possibility of this kind of module sharing. When it applies a patch it should recognize that the modules may already exist on the filesystem and should not apply them again if not necessary. It should however record some information in, e.g. /modules/system/layers/xyz/patches/xyz-2 indicating that the installation being patched is using that set of patch modules. This information will prevent deletion of patch modules used by multiple installations if one of the installations uses the patching feature's cleanup functions. h1. OSGi Bundle Loading OSGi bundle loading will follow the same rules as for module loading. The file used to specify what layers should be used will be a layers.conf file found in each directory in the bundle path (i.e. $JBOSS_HOME/bundles/layers.conf.) +The bundle loading mechanism will not use+ +$JBOSS_HOME/modules/layers.conf for identifying layers. Identities that wish to include bundles in layers other than the base will need to provide a $JBOSS_HOME/bundles/layers.conf.+</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss ESB Development] - Per http-provider security for EBWS - possible?</header>
    <body>I am attempting to use an HTTPGateway together with a SOAPProxy action to proxy a webservice. I need to be able to provide multiple endpoints, each with a different security contract, for the proxied web service (the point of the multiple endpoints is to have different security configurations.) After reading this post, where a discussion took place about adding the war-security tag to the ESB, it seems that being able to specify different security configurations for each endpoint (configured here using separate http-bus tags) is not possible:  https://community.jboss.org/message/349913#349913 https://community.jboss.org/message/349913 What would be nice, is to be able to configure separate security configurations for each http-bus reference. So my question is: Is what I want to do actually possible (JBoss ESB 4.11) and I am just missing it? If not, should it be a feature? It would make what I am trying to do a whole lot easier. If not, it seems I have to deploy multiple war files to handle each end point with differing security contracts and then get the requests to the ESB to be passed onto the proxied web service. Being able to specify it all here in a single ESB deployment file would be great - makes managing it a whole lot easier. Here is what my jboss-esb.xml looks like thus far: &lt;?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;jbossesb     xmlns=" http://anonsvn.labs.jboss.com/labs/jbossesb/trunk/product/etc/schemas/xml/jbossesb-1.3.0.xsd http://anonsvn.labs.jboss.com/labs/jbossesb/trunk/product/etc/schemas/xml/jbossesb-1.3.0.xsd"     parameterReloadSecs="5"&gt;     &lt;globals&gt;     &lt;!-- Security setting for all http-providers and all EBWSs in this jboss-esb.xml file.--&gt;         &lt;war-security method="BASIC" domain="JBossWS" /&gt;     &lt;/globals&gt;    &lt;providers&gt;        &lt;http-provider name="http"&gt;            &lt;http-bus busid="noaSecurity"/&gt;            &lt;http-bus busid="pkiSecurity"/&gt;            &lt;http-bus busid="wcfSecurity"/&gt;        &lt;/http-provider&gt;    &lt;/providers&gt;     &lt;services&gt;         &lt;service category="Stock" name="Quote" description="Stock Quote" invmScope="GLOBAL"&gt;             &lt;listeners&gt;                 &lt;http-gateway name="GW-NOA" busidref="noaSecurity" urlPattern="noa/*" /&gt;                 &lt;http-gateway name="GW-PKI" busidref="pkiSecurity" urlPattern="pki/*"/&gt;                 &lt;http-gateway name="GW-WCF" busidref="wcfSecurity" urlPattern="wcf/*"/&gt;             &lt;/listeners&gt;             &lt;actions mep="RequestResponse"&gt;                 &lt;action name="proxy" class="org.jboss.soa.esb.actions.soap.proxy.SOAPProxy"&gt;                     &lt;property name="wsdl" value=" http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx?WSDL http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx?WSDL"/&gt;                     &lt;/action&gt;             &lt;/actions&gt;         &lt;/service&gt;     &lt;/services&gt; &lt;/jbossesb&gt;</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [PicketBox Development] - WebJASPIOptionalAuthenticator, spec compliant?</header>
    <body>I "discovered" the valve WebJASPIOptionalAuthenticator in the JBoss AS (7.1.1, 7.1.3) source code. It doesn't seem to be documented anywhere, but judging from the code and from trying out it appears to do authentication for unprotected resources. The comment above the class says that authentication of unprotected resources is optional, but I couldn't find a reference to this in the source code. Regardless, all other JASPIC/JASPI/JSR 196 implementations that I tested (GlassFish, Geronimo, WebSphere) always call the SAM for unprotected resources. See: /** * &lt;p&gt; * This class implements a JASPI authenticator for unprotected resources. In the JASPI Servlet profile, authentication * for unprotected resources is optional but it is still allowed. When performed, the JASPI authentication modules must * grant access to the unprotected resources irrespective of the caller, which may be anonymous (i.e, no security info * supplied). * &lt;/p&gt; * * @author &lt;a href="mailto:sguilhen at redhat.com"&gt;Stefan Guilhen&lt;/a&gt; */ @SuppressWarnings("unused")   Additionally, while the class is called when configured in jboss-web.xml for unprotected resources, it doesn't seem to actually work. From the source code, it's clear that the callbackhandler isn't being processed:   Compare this to the corresponding fragment in WebJASPIAuthenticator, which does process the callbackhandler:           // the authentication process has been a success. We need to register the principal, username, password and roles         // with the container               // get the client principal from the callback.               // if the client principal is not a jboss generic principal, we need to build one before registering.             if (!(clientPrincipal instanceof JBossGenericPrincipal))               this.register(request, response, clientPrincipal, authMethod, pvc.getUsername(),               if (this.secureResponse)  </body>

See 'How do I build via commandline?' or 'How do I build in Eclipse (with m2e)?' above. +* *+ +*How do I build a series of projects (eg., Base, Server, Webservices) ?*+ * Assuming your goal is to change sources in *multiple* projects, then build them all to verify everything still compiles, you will need to fetch sources, then build the projects in dependency order. * This workflow is useful when you're looking to change framework code in an upstream project like Base on which Webservices or Server depends, and verify that API changes don't break the downstream project's code. * Rather than using `mvn verify`, you must use `*mvn install*` so that the downstream build will use YOUR locally-built content in your ~/.m2, rather than looking to the internet for the last published upstream dependencies. cd ~/jbosstools git clone https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-base git clone https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-server git clone https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-webservices cd ~/jbosstools/jbosstools-base; mvn install cd ~/jbosstools/jbosstools-server; mvn install cd ~/jbosstools/jbosstools-webservices; mvn verify +*Which is better - `mvn clean install` or `mvn verify` ?*+ * Use `*install*` to create artifacts in your ~/.m2 folder which will be checked when building anything which depends on those artifacts (in addition to checking the internet). Also useful for doing subsequent offline builds with the `*-o*` or `*--offline*` flag. * Use `*verify*` to build, but NOT install anything into your ~/.m2 folder. +*How do I clean out artifacts I might have installed to my ~/.m2/repo ?*+ +*What if I've already built something locally, but I want to build against the server version instead of my local repo?*+ * There are  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform#Locally_built_artifacts two approaches that work here: 0.1. override temporarily when building, using *-Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore*, or 0.2. delete *~/.m2/repository/.meta/p2-local-metadata.properties* +*How do I build a target platform?*+ * Currently, you should not need to build a target platform locally if you're building w/ maven via commandline. But if you'd like to materialize a target platform for use in Eclipse, you can do so like this: 1. Fetch target platforms project from github 2. Switch to the correct branch 3. Run maven 4. Results will be in jbosstools/multiple/target/jbosstools-multiple.target.repo/ or jbdevstudio/multiple/target/jbdevstudio-multiple.target.repo/ cd ~/jbosstools git clone https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms cd ~/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms git checkout 4.3.0 mvn install cd ~/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/jbosstools/multiple/target/jbosstools-multiple.target.repo/ +* *+ +*Why is there more than one target platform?*+ * Every time we make changes to the target platform, either to add/remove something, or to change the included version, we release a new version. * In order to verify we can build against the oldest version of a target platform (eg., one based on Eclipse 4.2.0, or "minimum" target platform) but also run tests against the latest for that stream (eg., based on Eclipse 4.2.2, or "maximum" target platform), we need to maintain multiple versions. * By default, your build will use the default "minimum" target platform specified in the JBoss Tools parent pom.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Tools Development] - Integration Tooling	Release Process</header>
    <body>h1. Overview This document details the process for building and releasing composite/aggregate update sites for the JBoss integration tooling (formerly SOA tools). h2. Goals * Provide a light-weight process with minimal overhead for component owners. * Provide an ever-current update site containing the latest, stable releases of integration tooling components. * Allow component owners to independently manage their release schedules. * Allow component owners to manage their own dependency stack. h2. Assumptions * Components use released versions of dependencies (i.e. stable builds). * Component owners manage their own interdependencies with other integration components. * Components and dependencies adhere to Eclipse API versioning rules. h2. Implications * Aggregate releases will be driven by component releases. * Aggregate releases should manage themselves. * Component nightly/milestone builds should always be compatible with other components in the aggregate. h2. Definitions * *Integration Stack (IS)* - all JBoss middleware integration tooling * *IS configuration* - the definition of specific components and versions that make up the IS * *IS build* - an update site (p2 repo) aggregating specific versions of integration tooling components. * *Release types:** *stable* - an IS build aggregating stable (i.e. final) builds of all components that has been certified/tested by QA. * *development* - an IS build aggregating stable builds of all components that has not been certified/tested by QA. * *integration* - an IS build aggregating stable, development (e.g. beta) and/or integration builds of all components * *next* - an internal IS build incorporating the latest integration builds of all components (i.e. the current "trunk" build).  This will be used for identifying potential future incompatibilities. Stable builds will align  with a JBDS release in the same way JBT core builds do today.  Development builds will reflect the current state of all stable components.  Theoretically, any development build could be QA'd and promoted to stable (assuming no test failures).  Integration builds allow for an "interim" stack which may be useful during a QA cycle (e.g. verifying a fix that requires updates to multiple components; a single component can be updated via the component update site).  Next builds are used to identify potential incompatiblilities among components before they are integrated into a release and would occur weekly/monthly via a Hudson job (e.g. targeting JBT integration builds). An IS build only needs to occur when the IS configuration changes.  Because the IS stack is composed of stable components, configuration changes will only occur when individual components are released.  For this reason, it is assumed the build would be invoked manually. h1. Roles and Responsibilities h2. Component Owners 1. *Component update site:*  Component owners must provide an update site for each release of their component that is included in an IS build. 2. *Updating IS configuration:*  Component owners must update the IS build configuration when a new version of their component is released.  This ensures the IS is up-to-date. 3. *Respond to change requests:*  Component owners must review IS configuration change requests and respond in a timely manner.  If a requested change is incompatible with the current version of your component, provide details regarding when your component will be compatible, along with a patch containing changes to the IS configuration for your compatible release. h2. Release Engineers 1. *Maintain build infrastructure:*  Release engineers will be responsible for maintianing the build infrastructure, primarily the Jenkins jobs. 2. *Processing pull requests:*  Release engineers will be responsible processing all pull requests related to IS configuration.  This is to ensure consistency in the composition of the stack (e.g. components, component versions, IS version, etc.). 3. *Initiate IS builds:*  Release engineers will be responsible for initiating IS builds. 4. *Build promotion:*  Release engineers will be responsible for the promotion of IS builds (e.g. from development to stable). h1. Release Process h2. Component Updates The following outlines the basic process for updating the IS configuration.  Typically, this would occur when a component is released, but the same process is also used for updating shared dependencies (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins, etc.). 1. Create branch in user repository for IS configuration changes. 2. Update IS configuration for updates, e.g. update URL for SwitchYard from 0.5.0.Final to 0.6.0.Final; update IS version from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (see versioning rules)1. Modify the  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack/blob/master/aggregate-site/compositeArtifacts.xml compositeArtifacts.xml and compositeContent.xml files (in aggregate-site) to point to the new update site. 2. Modify the category.xml file (in aggregate-site) as necessary for any feature changes (e.g. adding a feature). 3. Modify project version (pom.xml in aggregate-site). 4. For changes to dependencies:1. Modify base.target or community.target (in target-platform) 2. Modify project version (pom.xml in target-platform) 3. Ensure plugins are mirrored on jboss.org 3. Build locally to validate stack dependencies. 4. Create JIRA task requesting update, e.g. update SwitchYard to 0.6.0.Final* Include link to github branch in task * Include build  results (e.g. SUCCESS or specific dependency resolution errors) 5. Create subtasks against each IS component for verification/approval* For components that failed the consistency check, mark subtasks appropriately, e.g. m2e-wtp version is inconsistent 6. Merge any changes required by other components from subtasks (e.g. update Savara to 2.1.0.Final) 7. Build IS locally to validate dependency consistency 8. Issue pull request against upstream IS configuration project 9. Process pull (by release engineer) 10. Invoke build job (by release engineer) h2. Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS  within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. Dependency Updates The process for updating a shared dependency is the same as that for updating any other component, with the following additions: 1. Make sure the dependency is mirrored on jboss.org. 2. Make sure the dependency is not already included through JBT core. If a dependency is included through JBT core, you will need to coordinate with the core team on the upgrade, as the change may impact components outside the IS. h2. Versioning Rules - major.minor.update.build *Major* should be updated for: * Base platform changes, e.g. Eclipse Indigo-&gt;Juno, JBT 3.3-&gt;4.0 * Major component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 1.0-&gt;2.0 *Minor* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5-&gt;0.6 *Update* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5.0-&gt;0.5.1 *Build* should be updated for each build, e.g. when building against nightly/integration/development repositories ** Note, the basic assumption here is that components are adhering to basic API rules (per Eclipse; e.g. minor includes bug fixes and api additions, major may include breaking api changes). h1. Update Site Locations * *Integration builds:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Development builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Stable builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* h1. Infrastructure * *JIRA -*  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTIS * *Source -*  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-integration-stack* *target-platform* - provides a target platform defining all upstream dependencies for use by IS components (e.g. JBT core, third-party plugins) * *aggregate-site* - provides category and feature definitions for the IS update site * *Jenkins* - h2. Target Platforms The provided target platforms define all upstream dependencies available to an IS component.  Two target platforms are provided: base and community.  The base target platform includes all dependencies which are also included as part of JBDS.  The community target extends the base target by including dependencies which are only available in  community JBT releases.  If your component needs to be included in a JBDS release, DO NOT use the community target platform. h1. Future Plans 1. Add support for executing component unit tests as part of the aggregate build.  The goal being to help ensure the stability of the aggregate. 2. Add a "next" build that will build against upcoming core platforms (e.g. Kepler, JBT 5).  This should serve as an early warning system to identify platform incompatibilities early in the process. 3.</body>

Issue pull request against upstream IS configuration project 9. Process pull (by release engineer) 10. Invoke build job (by release engineer) h2. Platform Updates *Goal:* release updated IS within four weeks of JBT/JBDS core release. 1. Initiate platform update during JBT beta phase 2. Follow the component update process above (e.g. update JBT core from 3.3 to 4.0) h2. Dependency Updates The process for updating a shared dependency is the same as that for updating any other component, with the following additions: 1. Make sure the dependency is mirrored on jboss.org. 2. Make sure the dependency is not already included through JBT core. If a dependency is included through JBT core, you will need to coordinate with the core team on the upgrade, as the change may impact components outside the IS. h2. Versioning Rules - major.minor.update.build *Major* should be updated for: * Base platform changes, e.g. Eclipse Indigo-&gt;Juno, JBT 3.3-&gt;4.0 * Major component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 1.0-&gt;2.0 *Minor* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5-&gt;0.6 *Update* should be updated for minor component updates, e.g. SwitchYard 0.5.0-&gt;0.5.1 *Build* should be updated for each build, e.g. when building against nightly/integration/development repositories ** Note, the basic assumption here is that components are adhering to basic API rules (per Eclipse; e.g. minor includes bug fixes and api additions, major may include breaking api changes). h1. Update Site Locations * *Integration builds:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/integration/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Development builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* * *Stable builds:  http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate http://http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/integration-stack/aggregate* h1.

Target Platforms The provided target platforms define all upstream dependencies available to an IS component.  Two target platforms are provided: base and community.  The base target platform includes all dependencies which are also included as part of JBDS.  The community target extends the base target by including dependencies which are only available in  community JBT releases.  If your component needs to be included in a JBDS release, DO NOT use the community target platform. h1. Future Plans 1. Add support for executing component unit tests as part of the aggregate build.  The goal being to help ensure the stability of the aggregate. 2. Add a "next" build that will build against upcoming core platforms (e.g. Kepler, JBT 5).  This should serve as an early warning system to identify platform incompatibilities early in the process.</body>

Guidance for subsystems seeking passwords in AS7 The server module in JBoss AS7 workspace has a class called as VaultUtil which has methods for you to seamlessly pass the vault formatted string to get the password from the vault. I am posting the integration done in org.jboss.as.connector.subsystems.datasources.AbstractDataSourceService Note that do not seek the password from the vault during the xml parsing phase because the vault has not been initialized and ready. It has to be done in the services phase when you actually do something with the configured elements of your subsystem. In the case of JCA datasource integration, we do it in AbstractDataSourceService                               throw new RuntimeException(e); // TODO: use bundle from IJ   We do not want to make the configuration of the vault formatted string to be very difficult. As long as the formatted string is prefixed with VAULT::,  the vault will be invoked.  Custom implementations of the vault should consider the last token for any configuration. If you are using the AttributeDefinition classes the vaulted expression will be automatically resolved when calling AttributeDefiniton.resolveModelAttribute(). If you are not using AttributeDefinition you need to call OperationContext.resolveExpression() yourself as this example from DataSourceModelNodeUtil h2. h2. Frequently Asked Questions: * h5. How secure is this? * The default implementation of the vault utlizes a Java KeyStore. Its configuration uses Password Based Encryption, which is security by obscurity.  This is not 100% security. It only gets away from the problem of clear text passwords in configuration files.  There is always a weak link. (+*As mentallurg suggests in the comments, the keystore password is the weakest link*+). * Ideally, 3rd party ISV robust implementations of Vaults should provide the necessary security. * h5. Can I really secure the keystore? * You can store the keystore on an USB or an encrypted secure usb or such. * When the server starts, insert the USB. On successful start, you can remove the USB. * Ideally, use a FIPS 140-2 certified keystore from a keystore vendor if you want foolproof security. * h5. How do I get foolproof security for passwords? * The default implementation of Vault in JBossAS7 is not 100% secure. * You can increase level of security by adopting a FIPS 140-2 certified keystore. * You can use 3rd party implementations of the Vault (this is something we are pushing for ISVs to do). * h5. I lost the vault formatted string for my attribute? * Just reinsert the attribute value in the vault to overrwrite what was previously stored. You will get a new formatted string to insert in the xml. * h5. Can I do all this from the UI? * Hopefully with time, we can get this integrated into the console. * h5. *Show me how to do this on Windows.* *  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17763 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AS7PasswordVaultOnWindows * h5. Please give me an example. *  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17472 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AS7UtilisingMaskedPasswordsViaTheVault *  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17503 https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17503 * *What if my vault expression in AS7 configuration file (e.g. standalone.xml) didn't get resolved?** Vault expressions cannot be used everywhere. Only in attributes or elements marked as "allowedExpressions".</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - EAP jboss log.txt	getting too large</header>
    <body>I'm developing Struts 2 application and deploying that as war on EAP Jboss 6. At the beginning of development nothing gone wrong. But recently i realized that my disk space is grtting full because of log.txt file . When searching on web about this got lot of discussions but nothing helped me. From one post i tried to exclude log4j lib from the 'deployment-structure.xml' but nothing happened. Then i gone through standalone.xml file i found on subsystem tag which is *subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:1.1".* i removed that completely and deleted log.txt from that location. Now file is not created. Then tried different things on that tag each time log.txt file was created and lo was getting populated. I tried log4j.properties in my project but file was created not populated.Now i could understand that the *subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:1.1"* line calls the inbuilt jar file and a class from that jar creates the file. So please let me know where is that jar file actually located. I attached my log4j.properties with this query.</body>

You're saying that your persistence is working correctly, so can you investigate a little more about what entrries are in cart.getArticles()? Fetch them, fetch their hashCodes. It seems rather impossible that you have hashcode and equals methods that returns always the same value (1 and true), you have a collection with entities and still you're retrieving null...</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [EJB3 Development] - Re: Entity hashCode and	equals overriding</header>
    <body>I tried to use equals() returning true and hashCode returning 1 only for testing. Because in this way if all books has the same hashcode it would like "all the books are the same". But since even in this case the call returns null i've tried with normal equals() and hashCode() to print the hashCode of the book inserted in the cart and the hashCode of the book inserted. They were equals. However i can retry to investigate deeply. Thank u Piotr!</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [EJB3 Development] - Re: Entity hashCode and	equals overriding</header>
    <body>This is really weird Fabio. So you have a Map&lt;Book, Integer&gt; with one element - entry1 which key hashCode yields to 1 and equals always returns true. Then you have a Book instance - b1 which hashCode yields to 1 and equals always returns true. In this way you ask the Map&lt;Book, Integer&gt; for an entry with key b1. The hashCode == 1, so the bucket in the map is located correctly; the equals always returns true, so the element must be properly returned... Can it be some caching problem between you changing the code, deploying it on the server and running again? Saying it all - it seems like a problem not related with the JPA / persistence / database.</body>

    <body>I've just fix the problem! I've changed the code in this way: ------------------------------------------------------- @Override if (o==this) if (this.isbn.compareTo(((Book) o).getIsbn()) == 0) ------------------------------------------------------- The problem was the comparison between string! Now I use the compareTo() method and everything correctly works. Thank you for your time Piotr!</body>

    <body>It's geat it works, but it also should work if you returned the same value from hashcode and equals... the strngs comparison was not the issue it that situation, right?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single	Installation Patching</header>
    <body>During a discussion of this patching mechanism between Kevin Conner and the security response team, we covered the issue of old JARs being left on the system after they have been updated by a patch. With previous zip-based patching, the old JARs would be overwritten. With this mechanism, the old JARs are left on the system (for rollback etc.). This potentially exposes security concerns, where a patch provides updated JARs that resolve security issues. Although the old JARs would not be deployed in the running server, they could be exposed via classpath, and they could be accidentally/inadvertently used in running code. To remove this possibility, I suggest disabling old JARs when they are archived, and then re-enabling them again if and when they are rolled back. The disabling would need to be two-way (i.e. you can disable then re-enable later). It doesn't need to use any fancy techniques, so long as it effectively renders the JAR unusable. Off the top of my head, one way to do this is to just flip a bit in the zip file end of central directory signature (little-endian 0x06054b50). I have tested this method and it renders the JAR unable to be extracted, and unable to be executed by the JVM. Re-enabling is just a matter of flipping the bit back. Of course, this only works for zipped JARs; exploded JARs would require something similar done to the individual class files. What do people think, it this a feasible idea?</body>

    <body>Hi, By reading the " Generation of process and task forms" paragraph on the 10th chapter of the jbpm user guide i know that : # &lt;&lt;Designer will iterate through BPMN2 process and create forms for it, and each of the human tasks in that process. It uses the defined process variables and human task data input/output parameters and associations to create form fields. &gt;&gt; and # &lt;&lt;In order for process and task forms to be generated you have to make sure that your process has it's id parameter set, as well that each of your human tasks have the TaskName parameter set. Task forms contain pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so they are easily editable in any HTML editor. &gt;&gt; but i still don't know how to fill tasks properties to get fields on generated forms and which langage/syntaxe to use while filling them. i ve tried to write ; "String name;" on the "DataInputset" and in the "InputDataItem" but still have empty generated forms.. i didn't neither find any tutorial about how to properly use the oryx designer. thnx to resolve this problem.</body>

Guidance for subsystems seeking passwords in AS7 The server module in JBoss AS7 workspace has a class called as VaultUtil which has methods for you to seamlessly pass the vault formatted string to get the password from the vault. I am posting the integration done in org.jboss.as.connector.subsystems.datasources.AbstractDataSourceService Note that do not seek the password from the vault during the xml parsing phase because the vault has not been initialized and ready. It has to be done in the services phase when you actually do something with the configured elements of your subsystem. In the case of JCA datasource integration, we do it in AbstractDataSourceService                               throw new RuntimeException(e); // TODO: use bundle from IJ   We do not want to make the configuration of the vault formatted string to be very difficult. As long as the formatted string is prefixed with VAULT::,  the vault will be invoked.  Custom implementations of the vault should consider the last token for any configuration. If you are using the AttributeDefinition classes the vaulted expression will be automatically resolved when calling AttributeDefiniton.resolveModelAttribute(). If you are not using AttributeDefinition you need to call OperationContext.resolveExpression() yourself as this example from DataSourceModelNodeUtil h2. h2. Frequently Asked Questions: * h5. How secure is this? * The default implementation of the vault utlizes a Java KeyStore. Its configuration uses Password Based Encryption, which is security by obscurity.  This is not 100% security. It only gets away from the problem of clear text passwords in configuration files.  There is always a weak link. (+*As mentallurg suggests in the comments, the keystore password is the weakest link*+). * Ideally, 3rd party ISV robust implementations of Vaults should provide the necessary security. * h5. Can I really secure the keystore? * You can store the keystore on an USB or an encrypted secure usb or such. * When the server starts, insert the USB. On successful start, you can remove the USB. * Ideally, use a FIPS 140-2 certified keystore from a keystore vendor if you want foolproof security. * h5. How do I get foolproof security for passwords? * The default implementation of Vault in JBossAS7 is not 100% secure. * You can increase level of security by adopting a FIPS 140-2 certified keystore. * You can use 3rd party implementations of the Vault (this is something we are pushing for ISVs to do). * h5. Why should I use it? * There is no magic. The level of security is exactly the same as with plain text passwords * What's the reason to use it? * If you * * 111 * h5. I lost the vault formatted string for my attribute? * Just reinsert the attribute value in the vault to overrwrite what was previously stored. You will get a new formatted string to insert in the xml. * h5. Can I do all this from the UI? * Hopefully with time, we can get this integrated into the console. * h5. *Show me how to do this on Windows.* *  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17763 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AS7PasswordVaultOnWindows * h5.

Guidance for subsystems seeking passwords in AS7 The server module in JBoss AS7 workspace has a class called as VaultUtil which has methods for you to seamlessly pass the vault formatted string to get the password from the vault. I am posting the integration done in org.jboss.as.connector.subsystems.datasources.AbstractDataSourceService Note that do not seek the password from the vault during the xml parsing phase because the vault has not been initialized and ready. It has to be done in the services phase when you actually do something with the configured elements of your subsystem. In the case of JCA datasource integration, we do it in AbstractDataSourceService                               throw new RuntimeException(e); // TODO: use bundle from IJ   We do not want to make the configuration of the vault formatted string to be very difficult. As long as the formatted string is prefixed with VAULT::,  the vault will be invoked.  Custom implementations of the vault should consider the last token for any configuration. If you are using the AttributeDefinition classes the vaulted expression will be automatically resolved when calling AttributeDefiniton.resolveModelAttribute(). If you are not using AttributeDefinition you need to call OperationContext.resolveExpression() yourself as this example from DataSourceModelNodeUtil h2. h2. Frequently Asked Questions: * h5. How secure is this? * The default implementation of the vault utlizes a Java KeyStore. Its configuration uses Password Based Encryption, which is security by obscurity.  This is not 100% security. It only gets away from the problem of clear text passwords in configuration files.  There is always a weak link. (+*As mentallurg suggests in the comments, the keystore password is the weakest link*+). * Ideally, 3rd party ISV robust implementations of Vaults should provide the necessary security. * h5. Can I really secure the keystore? * You can store the keystore on an USB or an encrypted secure usb or such. * When the server starts, insert the USB. On successful start, you can remove the USB. * Ideally, use a FIPS 140-2 certified keystore from a keystore vendor if you want foolproof security. * h5. How do I get foolproof security for passwords? * The default implementation of Vault in JBossAS7 is not 100% secure. * You can increase level of security by adopting a FIPS 140-2 certified keystore. * You can use 3rd party implementations of the Vault (this is something we are pushing for ISVs to do). * h5. I lost the vault formatted string for my attribute? * Just reinsert the attribute value in the vault to overrwrite what was previously stored. You will get a new formatted string to insert in the xml. * h5. Can I do all this from the UI? * Hopefully with time, we can get this integrated into the console. * h5. *Show me how to do this on Windows.* *  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17763 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AS7PasswordVaultOnWindows * h5.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - JBoss Passwords - not secure, but recommended</header>
    <body>Following article describes how the passwords in JBoss can be secured: https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-17248 https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossAS7SecuringPasswords The key point is however missing there: What benefits it gives? *It is not secure! But why it is still recommended?* We should clearly understand, that the eventual level of security provided by JBoss vault is absolutely the same as in case of plain text passwords. First we will consider why (because it may be not obvious). Then we will see why in spite of this there are some benefits. * h5. What is the purpose of the JBoss vault? * The purpose is to prevent easy revealing of passwords used in JBoss configuration files. Actually not only passwords, but any sensitive data * h5. Why is it not secure? * JBoss needs to be able to restore passwords without user input. If JBoss asked user for password each time it starts, it would be secure, but not maintainable. It would be impossible to guarantie high availability of servers * It means JBoss should be able to restore passwords based only on resources available on server, i.e. vault and key store * If somebody obtains access to these files on server, he can easily restore encrypted passwords, even without knowing any secret information * Don't believe? See decryptor in the attachment. Start the application and provide the data that you used in the &lt;vault&gt; section of JBoss config * h5. But what's the reason to use it then? * h6. Without vault * Configuration of your application changes time to time. Sometimes you wish to restore the state that was "10 changes before" the current. That's why you wish to keep track of all changes. Where do you keep all previous versions? In an archive with a secret password? Or in some secret repository? Not bad * Then what you do if developers request your configs to analyze some problem? Do you thoroughly check the configs and remove all passwords before sending files to devs? Have you replaced all passwords? In all files you send? Ahh, OK, you use scripts. But are you sure you have adjusted the scripts after one more datasource was added last month? OK, you've done it * Are you sure it was on this environment, for this staging server? Not different config structure for another branch or stage? * Are you sure each time? Of course this can work. But what is the price? How much headake do you have each time? * h6. With vault * All passwords in your configs are encrypted * You replace the original passwords in configs only once and dont't care any more * You can share the configs with devs * You can keep all versions of configs in a normal non-secret repository (svn, git). Many people can access them (your devs, ops, admins, customer, your repo hoster like github or bitbucket) without compromising security * You "disclose" your configs AS IS. No need to remove passwords. No need to warry each time if you have have overlooked any sensitive info * You can automate backing up of all configs without compromising security * The only thing you should care about is the key store. You should keep it apart from your configs. But it is much easier. It is just a single file * h6. Idea * Basically we split the secret. One part is stored in config file. It is public. Another part is the key store. Keep it secretly. Of course, everyone who has access to the key store on your server can restore all the encrypted secrets. But you avoid the headake with maintenance of your configs * h5. Alternatives * If you have a non-JEE application, e.g. based on Spring, you may want to use Jasypt. But the level of security remains the same as with plain text passwords and the same as with vault. It is only kind of mirror to the vault approach:* In the vault case the password (for the key store) is public. It is masked, but actually is public. The actual secret is being kept on server (the key store) * In the case of Jasypt the public part (configs) is encrypted and cannot be restored without a password. The secret is the password used to decrypt the configs. And this secret is being kept on server (e.g. as an environment variable in a JBoss start script) * In both cases configs can be made public and maintained easily, without compromising security * In both cases if someone has access to the server, the secrets can be decrypted without much affort *Conclusion* With vault you don't get more security. There is no magic. But you get easily maintanable configs, that can be disclosed without any risks.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Readonly transactions in session beans</header>
    <body>If you're concerned about performance then you're better off optimising your database queries and structure.   In addition, it's worthwhile minimising the number of transactions that are started/committed per user request/response. One is ideal, or two (for processing request, and then generating the response) although this is not always possible.  On some consulting jobs I've seen applications have mighty performance improvements simply by making use of correct Tx management. I've seen some applications create N+1 transactions per request/response and their performance was ugly.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Readonly transactions in session beans</header>
    <body>I read article about transaction pitfalls. It is very interesting. So far I know that JPA2 does not support it directly and Hibernate Session could be used directly. I have real life scenarion where it is lot of I18N messages stored in database and there is stateless session bean which is providing method: getMessage(int id). The getMessage method is annotated with TransactionAttribute(REQUIRED) so read is executed inside transaction. The messages are rarely changed so I started to look for optimalizations. Springs developers told me to use transaction - read only. However now I am little bit confused. Maybe removing transaction from getMessage method will be better solution. Thanks for valueble information.</body>

    <body>ThymeLeaf is a templating engine. http://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html http://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html h2. Possible integration points h4. In CDI, even standalone: *  http://www.thymeleaf.org/apidocs/thymeleaf/2.0.14/org/thymeleaf/context/IContext.html IContext - the map of values available for the template. Those could be filled from CDI.           By default, ThymeLeaf uses OGNL against the map of variables to resolve the expressions.           The interface IContext has only  *http://127.0.0.1:8082/resource/jar%3Afile%3A/home/ondra/.m2/repository/org/thymeleaf/thymeleaf/2.0.14/thymeleaf-2.0.14-javadoc.jar%21/org/thymeleaf/context/IContext.html#getVariables%28%29 getVariables*(), so the values are not resolved per case - whole map needs to be given at the time of this call.  https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf/issues/101 RFE           Therefore, the map provided by CDIThymeContext would probably have to ** list all beans CDI could deliver, limited to those marked as beans somehow (i.e. not "any class"), ** override the methods of VariablesMap which ThymeLeaf actually uses, and look up the beans lazily.* Unfortunatelly, this wouldn't work: *** java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException     at cz.oz.thymeleaftry.cdi.LazyVariablesMap.size(LazyVariablesMap.java:27)     at java.util.HashMap.putAll(HashMap.java:597)     at org.thymeleaf.context.AbstractProcessingContext.createEvaluationRoot(AbstractProcessingContext.java:95) * Also, we could make the template names type-safe, by introducing one qualifier per page.           // Inject object with the template "Home", the template engine, and CDIThymeContext.             // Additional variables.             // Process. h4. Additionally, in Application Server: *  http://www.thymeleaf.org/apidocs/thymeleaf/2.0.14/org/thymeleaf/resourceresolver/IResourceResolver.html IResourceResolver - to load resources from deployments. ThymeLeaf's ClassLoaderResourceResolver uses just *  http://www.thymeleaf.org/apidocs/thymeleaf/2.0.14/org/thymeleaf/cache/ICacheManager.html ICacheManager - use InfiniSpan as cache. * @Resource TemplateEngine templateEngine;   - inject template engine configured as module. (Probably not much useful, ThymeLeaf is pretty simple, almost no config.) *  http://www.thymeleaf.org/apidocs/thymeleaf/2.0.14/org/thymeleaf/messageresolver/IMessageResolver.html IMessageResolver - anything useful to get the strings from?</body>

Unfortunately I couldn't find any Jira ticket related to such changes. at least, there are only a few tickets with state "Coding in Progress". I have an osgi product that is based on JBPM. periodicaly I create a branch that I use to  test against to new JBPM versions, just to ensure that everything will stay fine. my surprise was that the JBPM master branch couldn't be build, there are lot of maven and compile errors. could someone explain me what is going on and why jira is not being used to track such changes ? regards, Cristiano</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Cached Web Service Client sends wrong SoapAction in HTTP header</header>
    <body>Hi all, I have a problem with an application which I have migrated from JBoss AS5 to AS7. Parts of the application contain a JaxWS webservice client which makes calls to a remote web service. The former implementation was based on the +jboss-ws native+ stack. For performance reasons the web service client instance was cached and reused. When migrating to AS7 I have not changed the webservice client code so far, at least at first glance it looked like everything is working fine. But, whenever a JaxWS client is reused - taken from the pool - it sends a wrong *SoapAction* in the HTTP Headers. For Example server.log: --------------------------- ID: 3 Address: http://server:8080/....ServiceInterface Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Type: text/xml Payload: &lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&gt; &lt;soap:Header&gt;    &lt;nsh:AuthenticationHeader xmlns:nsh="http:...."&gt;...&lt;/nsh:AuthenticationHeader&gt; &lt;/soap:Header&gt; &lt;soap:Body&gt;    &lt;*GetTemplates* xmlns="....."&gt; ... &lt;/*GetTemplates*&gt; &lt;/soap:Body&gt;&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt; -------------------------------------- So as one sees, the actual call is '*GetTemplates*' but the SoapAction in the header is '*GetConfigurations*', which causes an Error-500 on the remote server. For the moment - as a hack - I remove the SoapAction from the HttpHeaders, before putting back the client stup into the pool: But I do not feal very comfortable with this hack. Does any ody know about this issue, or have I missed something during migration?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Logging Id's</header>
    <body>Best practice is to document the message ids used within the java classes. We've been using class javadoc like this in a lot of places: /** * This module is using message IDs in the ranges 14600-14899 and 13400-13499. * * This file is using the subsets 14630-14899 and 13450-13499 for non-logger messages. * * See &lt;a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16810"&gt;http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16810&lt;/a&gt; for the full * list of currently reserved JBAS message id blocks. * */ I've found it's helpful to also leave a comment at the end of the file indicating the last valid number for the file so people are less likely to overflow when they add a message. This is particularly useful if the valid range for the file is small and ends on an unusual number.</body>

    <body>h2. Frequently Asked Questions - now with correct answers: * h5. How secure is this? *It is NOT secure at all!* You *disclose the password* via KEYSTORE_PASSWORD. No matter how complex the implementation is. No matter if it uses Java KeyStore, RSA, DES, other algorithms. No matter how long RSA key is. No matter if any 3rd party vault implementation is used. You *disclose the password* to access the vault. Everyone who has access to the config can easily decrypt all the passowrds you have encrypted. This approach in JBoss is highly *vulneruble*! Unfortunately the Red Hat architect misleads all the users. Compare it to following. You have a sofisticated locker in your house door. But you leave the key hanging on the door. Will you expect any safety? Or you have highly secure alarm system in your car. But you leave a key on the hood of your car. What will you expect? Everyone can open your home door and use your car. The same is here with JBoss vault. * h5. Can I really secure the keystore? * You can store the keystore on an USB or an encrypted secure usb or such. * When the server starts, insert the USB. On successful start, you can remove the USB. *Wrong.* You can use USB of your developer's computer only. But you cannot use USB of your production servers. Because normally there is no physical access to it: it may be in a secured room you have no access to, or at your customer hundreads miles away, or it may be at your hoster, or in a cloud at Amazon, Rackspace, you name it. The JBoss server must start automatically each time the system starts. For instance the system was upgraded, or a patch was applied, or hardware was replaced, or system was restored from a back up. The whole system is restarted. The JBoss server must automatically start, too. If the vault is missing, your application on JBoss will NOT start. One might suggest to put the vault on another disk, mount it temporary during system start up, then unmount automatically after JBoss started. But this only reduces the probability. It does not solve the problem. As long as a disk is mounted, it is available to all system processes. A hacker or a process started by a hacker can access the mounted disk, too. The worst thing is that a Red Hat architect who designed and implemented it does not warn the users. Users have *false feeling of safety*. Wake up! You are in a big trouble if you use JBoss vault.</body>

    <body>Can you stop spreading FUD around? Read,  it says it uses "Password based Encryption" which is security by obscurity.  It is not 100% security. To really get foolproof security of passwords, you either: a) use FIPS 140-2 certified keystore or b) use a 3rd party ISV implementation of the vault. The default implementation provided allows masking of passwords and not ENCRYPTION of passwords.</body>

    <body>Hello, I`m trying to develop a Java ReastEasy client to send messages to a hornetq queue. I followed the steps listed in the jboss documentation but I couldnt find any help to this issue Following is my client code I`m receving the following errors. a) On the cleint side Exception in thread "main" org.apache.http.ProtocolException: The server failed to respond with a valid HTTP response b) On the server side 22:51:05,530 ERROR [org.jboss.remoting.remote.connection]  JBREM000200: Remote connection failed: java.io.IOException: Receiv ed an invalid message length of 1347375956 I have a web.xml file that I have created based on the rest documentation and placed it in the deployements folder of the JBOSS AS 7 directory. I also have the hornetq-rest.cml file in the same folder. Both get deployed correctly. I`m not sure if this is a code issue or I`m missing any configuration on the server side. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</body>

    <body>Some questions ;-) What documentation are you following? What are you trying to do? What does it have to do with RestEasy? I thought 4447 was the remoting port, can you really post json to it like that?</body>

    <body>Hey Nicklas, I followed the hornetq Rest configuration for Jboss AS 7. I have a blog that explained how hornetq was now a part of JBoss AS 7. Here are the  links http://hornetq.blogspot.com/2011/06/hornetq-on-jboss-as7.html http://hornetq.blogspot.com/2011/06/hornetq-on-jboss-as7.html http://hornetq.blogspot.com/2009/10/understanding-connectors-acceptors.html http://hornetq.blogspot.com/2009/10/understanding-connectors-acceptors.html I also read the documentation on the JBoss website and understood that all I had to do was copy the web.xml listed in the documentation and hornetq-rest.xml in deployments folder. The Jboss documentation that I referred was http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.0-beta-1/userguide/html/index.html http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.0-beta-1/userguide/html/index.html Also I`m trying to populate a message to teh hornetq queue listed in the standalone.xml file. RestEasy is a jar that contains the Rest API needed to populate messages to hornetq queue. I looked at the server output and that was the port all messages were redirected to. If there is any other port I should be looking at please let me know. I dont think JSON Object is a problem here because you can specify the content-type as application-xml and have an xml string passed to the server. I hope I answered all your questions. Thank you for helping me out here.</body>

Anyways, from the  http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/hornetq-rest/1.0-beta-3/userguide/html_single/#d0e49 http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/hornetq-rest/1.0-beta-3/userguide/html_single/#d0e49 example I get the picture that we're talking about a WAR with a web.xml which would indicate the REST calls would also have to target the http port (8080 by default) and the URL should hit the web context of the web application.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Architectural	overview of the AS?</header>
    <body>Hi,   Are there any high-level architechtural overview documentation of the AS? Considering the LOC-count of the AS, getting to know the code by just browsing around is quite time-consuming.    It would be nice to have some sort of overview what happens when the server boots, how subsystems are initialized, how a deployment is processed etc. People interested in the various subsystems could then venture on and document the overviews of the various subsystems (and the devs could chip in by correcting misunderstandings)</body>

    <body>I want to strongly second that. I was digging around the code for weeks now to figure out some of the basics (e.g. how to initialize a JBoss Module, how to create and register a service, how deployment works, etc.) but are still completely lost. Good documentation from the community was a hallmark of previous JBoss versions but I have a feeling that this is not the case anymore. All what is needed would be some basic high-level documentaiton from some of the "insider" and we - the community - could pick up the ball from here to add more documentation. My two cents...</body>

    <body>Yes, those are good fragments of information (the irc channel log is also useful) but there is unfortunately still no "100000feet overview". I know the devs are busy implementing but I still think it would be a good investment to spend 2-3 days documenting the big picture, describing the key systems and interfaces etc. With a solid backbone for the docs, I'm sure there are enough curious people willing to explore and document. Before you know it everything will be documented, lots of people know enough of the AS to start fixing the bugs themselves and then you can start recruiting!  ;)</body>

    <body>Hi Pavol, I'm not sure what may have happened.  I do know that some JSF impls are incompatible with some Richfaces versions. I'm happy to report that Multi-JSF is now fully integrated into master.  So you can build the very latest from  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as here or you can wait until tomorrow and download the latest nightly build from  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as here. Yes, it is ready for deploying apps.  If you stil have a problem, please report bugs  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/as7 here. Stan</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Design of AS7	multi-JSF feature</header>
    <body>*About multi-JSF* Currently, AS7 ships with two JSF implementations, a JSF 2.1 implementation and a JSF 1.2 implementation.  A web application can select which implementation is used by including a context param in web.xml.  By default, it uses the JSF 2.1 imlementation. "multi-JSF" allows installation of multiple JSF implementations (and versions) on the same AS7 server.  The goal is to allow use of any JSF implementation (MyFaces or Mojarra) and any version of those implementation from JSF 1.2 all the way up to the experimental JSF 2.2 versions.  This is far superior to the old WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL method because JSF jars do not need to be bundled with the webapp.  More importantly, "multi-JSF" provides an implementation that is fully integrated with the container.  This means more efficient annotation processing, lifecycle handling, and other integration advantages. *How it works* The way multi-JSF will work is that for each JSF version, a new slot is created in the modules path under *com.sun.jsf-impl*, *javax.faces.api*, and *org.jboss.as.jsf-injection*.  When the jsf-subsystem is started, it scans the module path to find all the installed JSF implementations.  When the JSF subsystem deploys a web app containing the specified context param, it adds the slotted modules to the deployment.  Here is an example of the context param for the latest milestone of Mojarra 2.2: &lt;context-param&gt;    &lt;param-name&gt;org.jboss.jbossfaces.JSF_CONFIG_NAME&lt;/param-name&gt;    &lt;param-value&gt;mojarra-2.2.0-m05&lt;/param-value&gt; &lt;/context-param&gt; *How a JSF implementation is installed* A single JSF implementation is installed using a  https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-18945 CLI deployment archive.  This archive includes the required jars and module.xml files.  It also includes CLI scripts for installing/uninstalling the JSF impls using the  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4265 CLI module command.  You execute the installation archive like this: The install script inside the archive looks like this: *How the CLI deployment archives are created* A CLI deployment archive for a JSF implementation/version is created using a standalone maven project you can  https://github.com/ssilvert/jboss-jsf-installer download from GitHub and run.  To create an archive with the project, you  call it like this: *mojarra example* *myfaces example* This pulls in the JSF resources and creates the install/uninstall scripts.  It is all bundled together in an archive (zip) file that must be manually renamed with a .cli extension. *How to change the default JSF implementation in AS7* The multi-JSF feature adds a new attribute to the JSF subsystem.  +default-jsf-impl-slot+ allows you to change the default JSF implementation.  You just need to issue a write-attribute command and set the value to one of the active impls.  Then restart AS7. https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/102-47689-11-19926/multi-jsf.png  https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/102-47689-11-19926/450-156/multi-jsf.png Alternatively, you can set this in your configuration file, such as standalone.xml: &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:jsf:1.0" default-jsf-impl-slot="mojarra-2.2.0-m05"/&gt; To see which JSF impls are installed, you can execute the +list-active-jsf-impls+ operation. /subsystem=jsf/:list-active-jsf-impls     "outcome" =&gt; "success",     "result" =&gt; [         "myfaces-2.1.8",         "mojarra-2.2.0-m05",         "1.2",         "main"     ] *Demo* I've attached a copy of install-mojarra-2.2.0-m05.cli and install-myfaces-2.1.8.cli.   You can use these *.cli files with the latest nightly build of AS7 (jboss-as-7.2.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT).</body>

I put this if-stmt in there just to show you how you can do both exploded and unexploded deployment via this Mixed Approach (this is code that can go in Brian's prototype):                 boolean explodedDeployment = true; // this is here just to keep the code around that deploys if we are unexploded So the idea is that you don't have to package fibo.ear as an unexploded deployment file in your module - you can actually package your module with fibo.ear exploded and this will enable it to be deployed properly</body>

My mod_cluster conf looks like below +LoadModule slotmem_module modules/mod_slotmem.so+ +LoadModule manager_module modules/mod_manager.so+ +LoadModule proxy_cluster_module modules/mod_proxy_cluster.so+ +LoadModule advertise_module modules/mod_advertise.so+ +#Listen 192.168.10.91:8008+ +&lt;VirtualHost 192.168.10.91:8008&gt;+ +    &lt;Directory /&gt;+ +        Order deny,allow+ +        Deny from all+ +    Allow from 127.0.0.1+ +    Allow from 192.168.10.+ +    &lt;/Directory&gt;+ +    &lt;Location /mod_cluster-manager&gt;+ +        SetHandler mod_cluster-manager+ +        Order deny,allow+ +    Deny from all+ +    Allow from 127.0.0.1+ +        Allow from 192.168.10.+ +    &lt;/Location&gt;+ +          ManagerBalancerName mycluster+ +      KeepAliveTimeout 60+ +      MaxKeepAliveRequests 0+ +          ServerAdvertise On+ +      EnableMCPMReceive+ +&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;+ I commented out the Listen directive because I put it in the main http.conf file (having it in this file does not change the outcome) and the above mod_cluster.conf file is located under my /etc/http/conf.d/ folder. I also saw that there is a bug related to this error but under Windows OS. What am I missing? Thanks C</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [Clustering Development] - Re: getting [emerg] create_mem_node /etc/httpd/logs/manager.node failed: Permission denied Configuration Failed when starting apache on rhel 6 after mod_cluster is added</header>
    <body>I solved the issue. It was SELinux after all. I ran "sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log | less" and saw that SELinux was denying httd write permissions to the /etc/httpd/logs/manager.node.nodes.lock file. So I temporaryly enabled it by running the following two lines "+grep httpd /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mypol+" "+semodule -i mypol.pp+" I then went and removed the locks "+rm -f /etc/httpd/logs/manager.node.nodes.lock+" "+rm -f /var/lock/subsys/httpd+" and then resstarted httpd ("service httpd start") That did the trick. I still see some errors in the log but at least for now httpd is running and I can see the mod_cluster-manager page. C</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - JPAWorkingMemoryDbLogger issue on server restart</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm using jpbm5.2 in my project which involves few User Tasks.  I have created different methods to start and load the knowledge session and also to start and complete the user task. I'm using the JPAWorkingMemoryDbLogger to log the entering and exiting of the nodes in the log tables. The logger is initialized when ever the StatefulKnowledgeSession is created or loaded. +          //load the knowledge session.+ +           ksession = Configuration.loadKSession(ksessionId,+ +                    myJbpm.getMyEmfPersistence(),+ +                    myJbpm.getMyKnowledgeBase());+ + + +  // Initialize logger to enter values in log table+ +JPAWorkingMemoryDbLogger myJpaLogger = new JPAWorkingMemoryDbLogger(++ksession);+ The knowledge session &amp; process instance id created is stored in project's database, so that whenever a user log in I could get the process info and load it. Now the problem is whenever the tomcat server restarts and the knowledge session is loaded and the process continued, entries are not made in the log tables, but Task table has proper entries. When checked at the console for sql queries, whenever the tomcat restarts the 'insert into nodeinstancelog...' statements are missing. My project's working depends on the data in nodeinstancelog table which I query to check where the process has reached.  So although the process has moved forward the nodeinstancelog do not have entries. Thereby crashing the whole application. This occurs only when the tomcat restarts- which occurs quite a few times where the project is intended to be deployed. The logger is giving me a hard time... kindly help.</body>

    <body>We have apache htp server connecting to 8009 port of jboss to server our app. After considerable time, we see lot of connections on 8009 port stay on ESTABLISHED state (after executing netstat -a) for ever. Even when i stop apache http server, the connections don't get released.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: Configuring jboss7 ajp connector timeout</header>
    <body>AJP logic is to keep the connections open as long as possible so ESTABLISHED state is OK. If you stop httpd the connections should be released. The jbossweb docs are for master = 7.2 for the moment.</body>

    <body>That is true in theory but in practice it happens that some ajp connections "hang" and only thing to make this work is to set connectionTimeout on ajp connector. Then thread/connection pool gets full, server doesn't accept any new (ajp) request. Fix would was to restart httpd or jboss... that was my expirience with all versions prior 7, but I didn't try this on 7 yet... -- tomaz</body>

I have updated Jboss 7.1.1 As   org.picketlink  modules with Picketlink 2.0.3-Final.jars as mentioned in some of the links in forum . all the examples are getting deployed and working as expected . I am planning to deploy my CXF web services as  .war file in Jboss Standalone deployment .  i have added  &lt;extension module="org.picketlink"/&gt; in the standalone.xml So it means , if i will deploy *.war file , i donot need to add picketlink 2.0.3-final related jars in to web-inf\lib folder , but looks like WAR file got deployed but not started ....

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Experimenting with Single Installation Patching</header>
    <body>*+Initial draft; I haven't verified everything in this doc yet!!!+* Instructions for experimenting with the " https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-47500 Single Installation Patching" feature currently being developed. These instructions assume basic git knowledge and knowledge of how to work with the AS 7 code base. See " https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15596 Hacking on JBoss AS7" for basic background. h2. Getting and Building the Source The patching feature is currently on a topic branch being maintained by Emanuel Muckenhuber. Until that branch is merged into master: 1) If you haven't already, clone the AS repo $ git clone git://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as.git 2) Add Emanuel's github repo as a remote $ cd jboss-as $ git remote add -f emanuel git://github.com/emuckenhuber/jboss-as.git 3) Checkout a new branch "patches-master" to track Emanuel's branch $ git checkout -t emanuel/patches-master 4) Build the AS $ ./build.sh add the -DskipTests option to skip running tests if you want the build to go a bit faster. h3. Generating Patches To generate a patch, you'll need 5 things: 1. An unzipped AS distribution representing the AS release being patched. This is the "applies-to-dist". This can be any AS7 release distribution, or the output of any successful build of the AS7 codebase since 7.1.0.Final was released. (Even earlier would probably work fine.) 2. An unzipped AS distribution representing the "patched" AS release. This is the "updated-dist". This is a distribution built from code that is newer than whatever went into the "applies-to" distribution. It can be a later release or build, or even the same distribution as the "applies-to-dist" that you've manually modified in some fashion. 3. An AS distribution you built following the instructions in the "Getting and Building the Source" section above. The patch generation tool is included in this distribution. If the distribution you are using for the "updated-dist" was built in that manner, then you can use it; you don't need a separate distribution. At some point we'll distribute the patch generation tool as a separate distribution, but for now it's simplest just to use an AS distribution. In the rest of this section, we'll refer to this as the "patch generation tool distribution." 4. A patch-config.xml file providing instructions about how to create the patch. See details below. 5. The filesystem location where you want the patch file to be written (including the name of the file.) To run the patch generation tool: $ cd /root/of/the/patch/generation/tool/distribution $ java -jar jboss-modules.jar -mp modules org.jboss.as.patching.generator --help INFO  [org.jboss.modules] JBoss Modules version 1.1.3.GA Usage: patch-gen.sh [args...] where args include:     --applies-to-dist=&lt;file&gt;  Filesystem path of a pristine unzip of                               the distribution of the version of the                               software to which the generated patch                               applies     -h, --help                Display this message and exit     --output-file=&lt;file&gt;      Filesystem location to which the                               generated patch file should be written     --patch-config=&lt;file&gt;     Filesystem path of the patch generation                               configuration file to use     --updated-dist=&lt;file&gt;     Filesystem path of a pristine unzip of                               a distribution of software which                               contains the changes that should be                               incorporated in the patch     -v, --version             Print version and exit To actually run the patch generation tool and not just get help output, you will need to append the --applies-to-dist, --updated-dist, --patch-config and --output-file arguments described above to the process launch command (instead of --help), with the appropriate value for each included. The java command above is pretty lengthy, so we've written a shell script that does the same thing. In the source code it can be found at patching/src/main/resources/patch-gen.sh. Copy that to the bin/ dir of the patch generation tool distribution and then you can get the output above by simply doing: $ bin/patch-gen.sh --help +TODO: the patch-gen tool should use sensible defaults for --applies-to-dist, --updated-dist and --output-file such that only --patch-config needs to be specified. Or, allow those locations to be specified in the patch-config.xml file itself.+ * +Default for +--updated-dist+ can be the current working dir, or its parent if the current working dir is named bin/. Apply some simple sanity checks, e.g. check for jboss-modules.jar etc. The assumption here is the tool is being run from the ++--updated-dist++ (which is the newest dist and thus will have the newest version of the tool) + * +Default for +--applies-to-dist+ can be a sibling of the root of --applies-to-dist, named the same as the applies-to-version in the patch-config.xml. + * +Default for --output-file can be patch.par in the current working dir, assuming no such file already exists+ h4. Methods of Patch Generation There are two basic methods of patch generation. Which the tool should use is declared in the patch-config.xml file: * generate-by-diff: The patch generation tool itself compares the contents of the --applies-to-dist and the --updated-dist and creates a patch. This is most useful for CP patches. +TODO for one-off patches allow an option where the diffing algorithm ignore will timestamps as described by Jeff Mesnil (http://https://community.jboss.org/wiki/SingleInstallationPatching#comment-11114).+ * specified-content: The patch-config.xml file declares in detail what modules, bundles and misc files are to be added, updated or removed via the patch. This is most useful for one-off patches where the patch author knows what has changed. h4. The patch-config.xml File The patch-config.xml file provides basic metadata about the patch, along with instructions on how to generate it. The person preparing the patch creates the patch-config.xml file. +Note: the file doesn't have to be named patch-config.xml; it can be named anything.+ The simplest way to describe the file is to show a couple of examples. The full xsd for the file can be found in the AS source dist at patching/src/main/resources/patch-config.xsd. An example patch-config file for a generate-by-diff patch: &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt; &lt;patch-config xmlns="urn:jboss:patch-config:1.0"&gt;     &lt;name&gt;6.1.0-to-6.1.1&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;description&gt;Cumulative patch to move from EAP 6.1.0.GA to EAP 6.1.1.GA&lt;/description&gt;     &lt;cumulative applies-to-version="EAP 6.1.0.GA" resulting-version="EAP 6.1.1.GA"/&gt;     &lt;generate-by-diff/&gt; &lt;/patch-config&gt; An example patch-config file for a specified-content patch: &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt; &lt;patch-config xmlns="urn:jboss:patch-config:1.0"&gt;     &lt;name&gt;JBPAPP6-123&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;description&gt;One off patch to fix JBPAPP6-123&lt;/description&gt;     &lt;one-off&gt;         &lt;applies-to-version&gt;EAP 6.1.0.GA&lt;/applies-to-version&gt;     &lt;/one-off&gt;     &lt;specified-content&gt;         &lt;modules&gt;             &lt;added-module name="org.jboss.as.foo" /&gt;             &lt;updated-module name="org.jboss.as.bar" slot="eap"/&gt;             &lt;removed-module name="org.jboss.as.fubar" /&gt;         &lt;/modules&gt;         &lt;misc-files&gt;             &lt;updated-misc-content path="bin/standalone.sh" /&gt;             &lt;updated-misc-content path="bin/standalone.bat" /&gt;         &lt;/misc-files&gt;     &lt;/specified-content&gt; &lt;/patch-config&gt; h3. Applying Patches Only an AS release that includes the patching feature can be patched using the patching tool. So, that means you can only experiment with applying patches to an AS distribution you built following the instructions in the "Getting and Building the Source" section above. That limits things a bit as far as what patches you can try to apply; for example you couldn't generate a patch that represents the difference between 7.1.2.Final and 7.1.3.Final and then apply it to 7.1.2.Final. To apply a patch, you need: 1. A patch file, prepared as described in the "Generating Patches" section. 2. An unzipped AS distribution that represents the "applies-to" distribution. This can be the exact same "applies-to" distribution you used when creating the patch, or, if you want to experiment with how the patch tool deals with the (typical) situation where the user has in some way modified a standard AS version, you can make some sort of modification. To actually apply the patch, the installation being patched needs to actually be running. It can be running a standalone server or the managed domain processes; either is ok. It can be running normally or in --admin-only mode. We use the standard AS CLI tool to provide the user interface for the patch application tool. To see how to apply the patch, cd into the root of the installation being patched, launch the CLI, connecting it to the target process and get the help for the "patch" command: $ bin/jboss-cli.sh -c [standalone at localhost:9999 /] patch --help SYNOPSIS     patch       &lt;action&gt; &lt;action_arguments&gt;*       [--override-all]       [--override-modules]       [--override=path(,path)*]       [--preserve=path(,path)*]       [--host=&lt;host&gt;]           where &lt;action&gt; can be   apply           - apply a patch   rollback        - rollback a patch that has been applied           and &lt;action_arguments&gt; depends on the &lt;action&gt; ACTION: apply    Apply a patch    .... h3. This document won't include any more details on actually executing the patch command. Part of the goal of experimenting with it is to see if the --help output is adequate for users to understand what to do. The patch command only stages the patch (i.e. modifies the filesystem in a way that should not impact the running target process.) To actually have the patch take effect in the runtime, the target process needs to be restarted: [standalone at localhost:9999 /] :shutdown(restart=true) Note that simply reloading the target process (using the :reload operation) is insufficient. +TODO add options to the patch command to automatically restart the process if staging is successful.+ h3. Following Progress The patching feature is still under active development, so if you want update your build and see what's new: 1) cd into the git repo you cloned in step 1) of "Getting and Building the Source" above. 2) Pull down the latest $ git fetch emanuel 3) Make sure you have a clean repo $ git status 4) Rebase your branch onto the latest $ git checkout patches-master $ git rebase emanuel/patches-master 5) Build again</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Remote EJB/JMS JBoss	AS 7.1.1 problem</header>
    <body>Hello, Past couple of weeks ive been trying to migrate project from JBoss 4.2.2GA to JBoss 7 AS. Everything went pretty much fine till i hit the remoting part on which I've stuck for a quite time now. In JBoss 4.2.2 project uses custom login module to authenticate remote calls. The promblem is that i have trouble to get the username/password to the server so the user can eb authenticated. Ive somewhat sorted otu the EJB invocation and i do it like this. standalone.xml &lt;security-realms&gt;          ...             &lt;security-realm name="TESTRealm"&gt;                 &lt;authentication&gt;                     &lt;jaas name="testdomain"/&gt;                 &lt;/authentication&gt;             &lt;/security-realm&gt;         &lt;/security-realms&gt; ....         &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:remoting:1.1"&gt;

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - WebApps sharing JPA entities in one cache</header>
    <body>Hi, i´ve been playing around a while now with trying to deploy several (spring+jpa) web applications in one jboss 7 instance and getting them to share their entities in one infinispan cache. Each web application ships some jars with it which contain several (maybe the same) POJO entity classes. Every app has its own persistence and application context. I read and learned that in such an environment it is not possible to use one single cache instance. Infinispan creates an instance for each web application which makes the cache mechanism useless for my case. Now I read about the possibility to use a standalone infinispan cache server and connect it to the JBoss instance as remote cache server. So I tried this configured the JBoss to use a remote-store, started infinispan server and JBoss server but the entities are not cached on the remote server. I also do not see anything from my entities in the jmx console of infinispan. Here is my configuration:         &lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:infinispan:1.2" default-cache-container="hibernate"&gt;             &lt;cache-container name="hibernate" default-cache="entity" start="EAGER"&gt;                 &lt;local-cache name="entity" start="EAGER"&gt;                     &lt;transaction mode="NON_XA"/&gt;                     &lt;eviction strategy="LRU" max-entries="1000000"/&gt;                     &lt;expiration max-idle="100000"/&gt;                     &lt;remote-store socket-timeout="60000"&gt;                         &lt;remote-server outbound-socket-binding="remote-store-hotrod-server"/&gt;                     &lt;/remote-store&gt;                 &lt;/local-cache&gt;                 &lt;local-cache name="local-query"&gt;                     &lt;transaction mode="NONE"/&gt;                     &lt;eviction strategy="LRU" max-entries="1000000"/&gt;                     &lt;expiration max-idle="100000"/&gt;                 &lt;/local-cache&gt;                 &lt;local-cache name="timestamps"&gt;                     &lt;transaction mode="NONE"/&gt;                     &lt;eviction strategy="NONE"/&gt;                 &lt;/local-cache&gt;             &lt;/cache-container&gt;         &lt;/subsystem&gt; ...         ...         &lt;outbound-socket-binding name="remote-store-hotrod-server"&gt;             &lt;remote-destination host="127.0.0.1" port="11222"/&gt;         &lt;/outbound-socket-binding&gt;     &lt;/socket-binding-group&gt; I´m feeling very uncertain with all this cause I did not find any working example for such a scenario. I even did not find an example or description of the configuration for using remote store, infinispan server and JPA. Maybe someone could give me a hint or link to some documentation or could just tell me, that this is not the right way to solve the problem?!? Thanks in advance, Ernie</body>

    <body>Hi Scott, here is my Hibernate configuration: |  | &lt;persistence-unit name="lms" | |  |  | transaction-type="JTA"&gt; | |  |  | &lt;jta-data-source&gt;java:jboss/datasources/lms&lt;/jta-data-source&gt; | |  |  | &lt;shared-cache-mode&gt;ENABLE_SELECTIVE&lt;/shared-cache-mode&gt; | |  |  | &lt;properties&gt; | |  |  |  | &lt;property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache" value="true" /&gt; | |  |  |  | &lt;property name="hibernate.transaction.factory_class" value="org.hibernate.transaction.CMTTransactionFactory"/&gt; | |  |  |  | &lt;property name="hibernate.cache.infinispan.statistics" value="true"/&gt; | |  |  |  | &lt;property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class" value="org.jboss.as.jpa.hibernate4.infinispan.InfinispanRegionFactory"/&gt; | |  |  |  | &lt;property name="hibernate.cache.region_prefix" value="lms"/&gt; |  |  | |  |  | &lt;/properties&gt; | |  |  |  | |  |  | &lt;class&gt;pojo.Artikelstamm&lt;/class&gt; ... | I have 2 web applications which both have a persistence unit containing the configuration listed above + addtional application specific classes. After starting JBoss caching for Property instances works but each application caches it on its own. If I have a look in JMX-Console (attached) I see that each application got two entries called "Infinispan 2" and "Infinispan 3" for application 1 and "Infinispan 4" and "Infinispan 5" for application 2. This looks a bit strange?!? If I fetch Artikelstamm entries in application 1 I get such entries listed in the JMX statistics part of Artikelstamm. But application 2 gets nothing of those entries to its cache.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - jboss-modules: Module Repository SPI and Extensibility</header>
    <body>I have the following use cases I'd like to fulfill: 1) Boot JBossAS from a single-JAR distribution 2) Boot JBossAS from a slim executable JAR, using module libraries located on a remote repository (if not already in a user's local module repository) 3) Create a modular Arquillian Server Daemon executable JAR, with module root located inside of this JAR under META-INF/modules Reasoning: Fulfilling this contract is required of ModuleLoader subtypes.  Typically this amounts to finding and parsing a "module.xml" file from the given ModuleIdentifier, but the mechanism for doing this (ModuleXmlParser) is package-private.  It's therefore not very intuitive (or possible) for users outside of jboss-modules to meet the demands of the method signature. David points out that ModuleLoader implementations are instead encouraged to use a delagation mechanism, via something like: @Override The issue here is that we need a delegate capable of servicing the request.  LocalModuleLoader is fine for filesystem-based repositories (though it's final and cannot be extended), but modules could conceivably be located anywhere (and may even have some descriptor format other than module.xml).  This is exacerbated by the unavailability of other ModuleLoader implementations which are not visible outside jboss-modules: ClassPathModuleLoader JarModuleLoader For for my use cases 1) and 3) above, I believe my only options are to resort to a bit of a hack which unpacks the module root in a JAR to something that can be read by LocalModuleLoader. I'll paste that code below the fold[1]. Use case 2) I hope to see more discussion on; I have a patch in  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODULES-146: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MODULES-146:  https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-modules/pull/22 https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-modules/pull/22. Because we probably don't want to be changing the existing SPI much, perhaps introducing a new ModuleRepository SPI layer would make sense looking forward?  David has mentioned an "install" SPI, but I think "installation" is still an implementation detail with respect to module loading.  I believe an abstraction between jboss-modules and any backing module repository (which is a VFS) will do. S, ALR PS - I could even make a ShrinkWrap-based ModuleRepository.  :) [1] /* * JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source * Copyright 2012, Red Hat Middleware LLC, and individual contributors * by the @authors tag.

    <body>Something else worth noting: If using the delegation provided by "preloadModule", then the contract of "findModule" becomes a NO-OP (in the code above I throw UnsupportedOperationException to illustrate this point).</body>

    <body>This would be a great feature. I have another use case that this capability would hopefully help with. *Installing custom AS7 subsystems* AS7 makes it pretty straightforward to add functionality by creating custom subsystems. But at the moment, delivering those subsystems to users is difficult. Currently the only practical and easy option is to provide a ZIP file with modules and supporting files (e.g., XSDs, sample standalone configurations, etc.) that users can expand over the top of their AS7 installations. However, as the community starts building up an ecosystem of subsystems and modules, the ZIP approach becomes more difficult for both producers and consumers. Consider a subsystem that requires its own modules, plus requires several other modularized libraries. This currently requires obtaining the ZIP file for each modularized library. Yet the modules already include dependency information, a module repository (and repository-compatible ModuleLoader) could automatically installing the (not-yet-installed) required dependencies. A concrete example of this is ModeShape's subsystem for AS7, which depends upon (among others) Hibernate Search and Lucene. At the moment, there is no modularlized form of Hibernate Search or Lucene, so ModeShape currently provides them. This makes installation of ModeShape very easy (it's just a single ZIP file), but we don't want to be in the business of providing modules for 3rd party libraries. It also makes it harder to install multiple subsystems that provide the same modules into the same AS7 installation. Ideally, these modules would be available in a repository and AS7 would automatically download them as needed. This would make it much easier to package subsystems as well as installing multiple subsystems into a single AS7 installations.</body>

    <body>I've actually been giving this some thought, too, but left it out of this discussion for the time-being.  Now that you raise it, what the hell.  :) If we were to build out a remote repository of modules (much like Maven Central), it'd open the door to on-demand installation of services into JBossAS.  Carlo used to envision something like a "yum" or "apt-get" feature which could map a named service into a series of dependencies to be brought in and installed. Additionally, we could perform upgrades of running services; it'd even be possible to have two versions of the same subsystem running concurrently in a single VM, provided we worked out a way to synchronize access to shared external resources (like ports).  It'd be nice to have a user application A running on JBossWeb version X alongside user application B running on JBossWeb version Y; users wouldn't have to touch application A until they're ready.  To some extent this is already possible by bundling frameworks inside the deployment. The real value-add for me here is that we'd essentially be able to match what RHN (Red Hat Network) does for RHEL - provide a subscription service to push one-click upgrades to all servers in a Domain or ServerGroup. One obvious hitch I see is the use of "main" as a default; I suspect that modules would have to become more explicit about the versions they depend upon.  As it stands, JBossAS ships with a single module repository populated with the versions it needs - we'd have to expand this notion such that all modules would be aware that they could be housed in a much more expansive repository (which would grow over time) and be explicit about their versioned dependencies. Has any of the above been discussed/planned in the context of JBossAS.next? S, ALR</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [Clustering Development] - JPA Entity(hibernate) update is not replicated with REPL_SYNC cache mode</header>
    <body>Dear JBoss users, I am using jboss AS 5.0 and I have the following issue : I am working on POF with having stateless session bean in cluster (round robin) in front of the hibernate-jpa. The second level cache is turned on. I have tried all cache configuration (optimistic-shared, pessimistic-shared, optimistic-entity, etc...), but I do experience in all cases that the Entity update does not get synced/invalidated on the other node. When a new item is added to the cache it is always replicated well, but the entity update does not. So this means that on only one node the second level cache is updated on the other node the old data remains. So when after the entity update I make the call to the session beans on the different nodes they return different data for the same entity. On the node which received the entity update call everything is fine, however the other node does not receive any notification about the update. I turned the org.hibernate.cache log to INFO and I see "externalPutRead" command notification when a new item is added to the cache on the other node, however I see nothing when the entity is updated by the other node. My JPA Entity's cache configuration is TRANSACTIONAL and the JPA EntityManager access is done in REQUIRED transaction in the session bean. Do I miss anything? Thanks for any comment. regards, Miklos</body>

    <body>While attempting to install a software on Jboss EAP 6, I encoutered some problems related to the fact that "context.xml" isn't supported. I wanted to use the attribute "privileged" in "context.xml" to get the ServletWrapper in my ContainerServlet. But it didn't work. Why? *Explanation:* After reading the method "loadServlet" of the class "org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapper", I found this block:             // Special handling for ContainerServlet instances             if ((servlet instanceof ContainerServlet) &amp;&amp;                   (isContainerProvidedServlet(actualClass) || IMHO, that's a bug, because the new fork of JBoss AS7 from TC7 don't allow to change the "privileged" attribute context (by configuration or any other way), so it's always false, that's why we can't get this work as for TC7 and not in Jboss AS7 (EAP6). *Solution:* One of those solution can be made: 1.  An alternative to set "privileged" via configuration (Init param or other). 2. Remove the block "*((Context)getParent()).getPrivileged()*" from the above test statement.</body>

    <body>Hi! I've created a simple login module based on org.jboss.security.auth.spi.UsernamePasswordLoginModule. Also, created a new security domain: [code] &lt;security-domain name="mydomain" cache-type="default"&gt;      &lt;authentication&gt;           &lt;login-module code="com.test.MylLoginModule" flag="required"&gt;&lt;/login-module&gt;      &lt;/authentication&gt; &lt;/security-domain&gt; [/code] jboss-web.xml: [code] &lt;jboss-web&gt;      &lt;context-root&gt;myapp&lt;/context-root&gt;      &lt;security-domain&gt;mydomain&lt;/security-domain&gt;      &lt;disable-audit&gt;true&lt;/disable-audit&gt; &lt;/jboss-web&gt; [/code] Authentication configuration in web.xml: [code] &lt;login-config&gt;      &lt;auth-method&gt;FORM&lt;/auth-method&gt;      &lt;form-login-config&gt;           &lt;form-login-page&gt;/login.jsp&lt;/form-login-page&gt;           &lt;form-error-page&gt;/loginerror.jsp&lt;/form-error-page&gt;      &lt;/form-login-config&gt; &lt;/login-config&gt; [/code] All works fine, but if to login from several different places (computers), session sometimes seems "shared": login/logout in app running in one machine causes login/logout for the application running on another. In other words, two users trying to login using the same credentials, but from different places. I was sure such authentication mechanizm works with browser session, isn't it?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [EJB3 Development] - Suspend MDB message processing until @StartupBean has finished initialization</header>
    <body>Hi :-) While migrating a JBoss 5 application to JBoss AS 7 (7.1.1.FINAL) I have a problem with a new JMS message driven EJB. Within message processing, some master data fields have to be checked. To enhance performance, this master data shall be preloaded into a cache structure using a @Singleton @Startup EJB, which needs about 30 seconds to load the data. My problem is that the queue message processing starts even if the cache has not been fully initialized, causing message validation errors. I tried to define a dependency between the MDB and the startup EJB, but as far as I understood the @DependsOn annotation works only with @Singleton EJBs. So it's clear that my solution does not work ;-) Startup bean code: @Singleton @Startup     @PostConstruct         // TODO load master data cache (takes about 30 seconds)     @PreDestroy()         // TODO free master data cache Note: I stripped the real code from the example to make it easier to read :-) Message driven bean code:         @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="destinationType", propertyValue="javax.jms.Queue"),         @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="destination", propertyValue="jms/SampleQueue"),         @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "acknowledgeMode", propertyValue = "Auto-acknowledge") @DependsOn("StartupBean")         // TODO validate message using master data cache Question: How can I suspend message processing until the startup bean has finished loading the cache? Any suggestions greatly appreciated :-)!</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Management of HornetQ	core queues</header>
    <body>While working on AS7-1960[1] Kabir noticed that HornetQ core queues created with the HornetQ API (eg ClientSession.createQueue) were not exposed correctly as AS7 resources. The resource does not exist (:read-resource &amp; :write-attribute fails) but it is still possible to interact with it (eg invoke :read-attribute or other queue-specific operations such as :pause or :resume)[2]. The problem is more general for HornetQ. When HornetQ creates JMS resources, it also creates underlying core queues for them (1 core queue per JMS queue and 1 + n core queues for 1 JMS topic with n subscribers). These core queues are not exposed by AS7 either[3]. My first idea was to materialize these resources correctly but this brings more problems. Their resource definitions flagged them as stored in the configuration. I don't think that queues created outside of the AS7 management API should be stored in its configuration. At the same time, for backwards compatibility, we must continue to support the management operations on these core queues at their current addresses (/subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=XXX/queue=YYY) After talking to Kabir on IRC, the idea would be to: * expose all HornetQ core queues as runtime read-only resources in a separate address (eg /subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=XXX/runtime-queue=YYY). These resources would be handled dynamically based on HornetQServer management service (like it's done for core-address resources) * for backwards compatibility, forward the "read-only" and runtime management operations (read-attribute, queue-specific operations) from /subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=XXX/queue=YYY to /subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=XXX/runtime-queue=YYY * Queues created by AS7 management API will remain at their current address and support read/write attributes and be persisted in AS7 configuration [1]  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-1960 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-1960 [2]  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5850 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5850 [3]  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4960 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4960</body>

    <body>Hi Arun, You are correct that the multihome facility exists only in Remoting versions 2.4.x/2.5.x.  It was a substantial code change, and it won't be ported back to the 2.2.x versions for AS 4.  In fact, all of these versions are now in maintenance mode. The only thing I can suggest (other than doing the port yourself) would be to drop in a 2.5 version (2.5.4.SP4 is the latest) and see if it works.  I expect it to be compatible, but there are no guarantees. Good luck. -Ron</body>

    <body>Wow.  I didn't know there was anyone doing that except me! It should be fairly straightforward to modify the maven project to create your own "install pack" *.cli archive.  You can fork my project from github and give it a try: https://github.com/ssilvert/jboss-jsf-installer https://github.com/ssilvert/jboss-jsf-installer It's a little rough right now since I've been concentrating on the end result rather than the project itself.  If you have questions I'll be glad to go through it with you. The biggest flaw is that its artifact is a zip file that you have to manually rename to *.cli.  If you make any improvements, patches are most welcome.</body>

    <body>You can't catch this particular exception in an error page because it is happening in a background thread rather than the request processing thread. With respect to your original problem, you need to be careful with exception handling in stateful EJBs because the container will unceremoniously remove it if a java.lang.RuntimeException is thrown from it. This is because the bean is then considered to be in an inconsistent state. If it's normal to expect a transaction failure from time to time (duplicate keys comes to mind here) then you may be better off performing that particular operation from a stateless EJB.</body>

    <body>First, we have an organization that wants to accept loan applications via web services from various sources.  In this case, the logical loan application process is a long running process containing human tasks. So, they want to expose one Web Service on the ESB that accepts the loan application and begins processing it.  An email will be sent when the application is approved or denied, but they also want to provide a mechanism for the requester to check status while the process is running.  So, they want to expose a second web service on the ESB that allows the requester to get back status on the loan application in process.  This status may be stored in a textual jBPM variable or maybe the ESB service returns the root token's current process node name or something.  The point is, without the process instance ID that was created with the application submission, how will the status check web service be able to know which process ID to check for intermediate status? -</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single Installation	Patching</header>
    <body>This article outlines design notes for the single instance patching feature being developed for AS 7.2. The 7.2 version of the feature will be apply to apply a patch to a single installation of the AS (i.e. a single unzip of the AS distribution.) That single installation may be being used for a standalone server or for a managed domain Host Controller and servers. However, the 7.2 version will not support coordinated patching by the patching tool of multiple installation in a managed domain. The user can of course independently patch multiple installation in a domain, coordinating the application of those patches themselves. The basic patching process will consist of: 1. The user obtains a patch file. 2. The user uses the CLI tool to connect to a standalone server or Host Controller that is running on the installation that is to be patched.1. The server or Host Controller may be running in admin-only mode or running normally. However, some patches may not be able to be applied if the target process isn't running in admin-only mode 3. The user invokes a command on the CLI providing the location of the patch file. The CLi invokes an operation(s) on the target process telling it to stage the patch. 4. The target process stages the patch by applying the patch contents to the filesystem.1. The changes made to the filesystem during staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before applying the patch. 5. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the staged patch is visible in the runtime. Patches can also be rolled back: 1. The user can use the CLI tool to instruct the target process to revert a patch. 2. Patch reversion results in changes to the filesystem that are staged in the same manner as what is done with a patch installation.1. The changes made to the filesystem during patch rollback staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch rollback with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before rolling back the patch. 3. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the rolled back patch is no longer visible in the runtime. h1. Patch File A patch file is a zip archive that contains a patch.xml file that is used to describe the patch along with the updated modules, OSGi bundles and miscellaneous files that comprise the patch. It's structure is as follows: + META-INF ++ patch.xml + modules ++ patch modules in the same structure as they appear the modules dir in the normal AS dist + bundles ++ patch bundles in the same structure as they appear the bundles dir in the normal AS dist + misc ++ misc files that need to be updated, organized in a directory structure that matches the directory structure of the AS dist h3. The patch.xml File The patch.xml file describes the patch. It includes basic information about the patch along with metadata about the modules, bundles and misc files in the patch. h5. Basic patch metadata * The name of the patch * The type of the patch (one-off vs cumulative, etc -- TODO list all) * The version to which the patch applies * A text description of the patch * TODO others h5. Module metadata * The name of the module * The slot of the module * The hash of the module.xml file of the previous version of the module. Not present if the relevant module did not exist in the version being patched. h5. Removed module metadata Identifies modules that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed module * The slot of the removed module h5. Bundle metadata * TODO anything? h5. Removed bundle metadata Identifies bundles that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed bundle h5. Misc file metadata * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file did not exist in the version being patched. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h5. Removed misc file metadata Identifies misc files that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h2. Patch Staging The target process when it applies a patch will create a patches directory directly underneath the root of the AS distribution. As with other directories, the location of this directory can be controlled via a system property passed to the JVM at process launch. Before patch staging begins, a check is made as to whether the target process is in admin-only mode. If it is not, and an unresolvable conflict is detected between a module, bundle or miscellaneous file contained in the patch and a user-modification of the corresponding item in the installation being patched, the patch staging process will be aborted with an error message.  See "Patch Conflict Detection" below. h4. Modules Patch modules will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. Information about the location of this directory will be stored in a location visible to the module loader used by JBoss Modules at boot.  This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the module loader currently in use by the target process. TODO describe check for user-modified modules. Information about removed modules will also be stored in a location visible to the boot module loader at next boot. h4. Bundles Patch bundes will be staged by copying them to a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. This patch-specific subdirectory is not visible to the OSGi subsystem currently in use by the target process. Information about removed bundles will also be stored in a location visible to the OSGi subsystem at next boot. h4. Misc files Misc files are staged by copying them directly to their normal location on the filesystem. A copy of the existing file at that location will be stored in the patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. TODO describe check for user-modified misc files. h4. Configuration files Patches will not modify the configuration files of the target process. Configuration patching will not be supported in this version of the feature (and may never be supported.)  Configuration files belong to the user. However, a copy of all existing configuration files will be made in a patch-specific subdirectory of the patches directory. During patch rollback, these configuration files will be restored. This backup is necessary because once the patch is applied to the runtime, any management operation that results in persistence of the configuration will use the xml schemas associated with the patched version of the core AS and any subsystems. If the patch is reverted, those schemas may not be intelligible to the version of the code to which the runtime has been reverted. h2. Patch Application TODO h2. Rollback Staging To do a patch rollback, the target process must be placed in admin-only mode. TODO h4. Modules TODO h4. Bundles TODO h4. Misc Files The backup copies of the miscellaneous files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored to their normal locations. Any misc files that were added as part of the "Patch Staging" process (i.e. those that were new in the patch) will be removed. TODO h4. Configuration The backup copies of the configuration files stored during the "Patch Staging" process will be restored. *+Any configuration changes made while the patch was in place will be lost.+* TODO h2. Rollback Application TODO Issue: the client tool (i.e. CLI) may need to be able to roll back a patch itself, not relying on the target process to do it. This is because a failed patch may leave the target process in a state such that it is unable to respond to commands from the CLI. This capability will not work remotely -- the CLI process will need to be running on the same machine as the installation being patched, and running under a user account with the necessary filesystem permissions to update the filesystem. h2. Patch Conflict Detection At the beginning of the patch staging process, a check will be made for conflicts between the patch and any user modifications to the same item. The user when executing the patch command can provide information to guide the tool in resolving conflicts. Any conflicts that cannot be resolved will result in the patch staging being aborted with no changes to the filesystem. Conflict types are: * Modules. If the patch is updating an existing module, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing module's module.xml file. The patching process will hash the current module.xml file to check for modifications. If any affected module is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a parameter indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. No option will be given to optionally override some modules and leave others unmodified. If the user wishes to retain some modification they made to module.xml, they will need to make an equivalent change to the module.xml in the patch module. The sole purpose of this "module conflict detection" is to provide information to users. * Bundles: TODO * Misc files: If the patch is updating an existing misc file, the patch.xml file will include the hash of the existing ile. The patching process will hash the current file to check for modifications. If any affected file is found to have been modified, the patch command will have to have been provided with a permission indicating that "overriding" modified modules is ok. These permissions can come in two forms:* A global permission to update all misc files, provided as a param to the CLI tools patching command * A file containing a list of paths (relative to $JBOSS_HOME) for which update permission is granted. The patching feature will also include a command that can apply this conflict detection process and provide a report of conflicts. Users can use this command to check for conflicts in advance. TODO describe how this will work for patch rollback. h2. Patch Generation Tool * Accepts basic metadata along with the location of a distribution of the new version along with a distribution of the old version* Also includes details on any misc files that are expected to be in active use * Generates a patch.xml file * Can generate a full patch file * Optional: Can be run from inside the bin/ dir of the full distribution of the new version and if provided with the patch.xml file can generate a patch file from the contents of the full dist* Idea here is the patch.xml file could be distributed as part of the new version and the user could use it to generate patch</body>

    <body>Yes, I want to support some side operations to report on patching history. Exactly what, TBD.  :) Re: attaching .cli files for pre/post action, can you file a feature request JIRA? I like the idea. I have my doubts it will make it in the first iteration of this feature, but you never know, and in any case I think it's a very good idea.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Single Installation	Patching</header>
    <body>This article outlines design notes for the single instance patching feature being developed for AS 7.2. The 7.2 version of the feature will be apply to apply a patch to a single installation of the AS (i.e. a single unzip of the AS distribution.) That single installation may be being used for a standalone server or for a managed domain Host Controller and servers. However, the 7.2 version will not support coordinated patching by the patching tool of multiple installation in a managed domain. The user can of course independently patch multiple installation in a domain, coordinating the application of those patches themselves. The basic patching process will consist of: 1. The user obtains a patch file. 2. The user uses the CLI tool to connect to a standalone server or Host Controller that is running on the installation that is to be patched.1. The server or Host Controller may be running in admin-only mode or running normally. However, some patches may not be able to be applied if the target process isn't running in admin-only mode 3. The user invokes a command on the CLI providing the location of the patch file. The CLi invokes an operation(s) on the target process telling it to stage the patch. 4. The target process stages the patch by applying the patch contents to the filesystem.1. The changes made to the filesystem during staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before applying the patch. 5. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the staged patch is visible in the runtime. Patches can also be rolled back: 1. The user can use the CLI tool to instruct the target process to revert a patch. 2. Patch reversion results in changes to the filesystem that are staged in the same manner as what is done with a patch installation.1. The changes made to the filesystem during patch rollback staging should not affect the running operation of the server. If this is not possible, the server should reject the patch rollback with an error message indicating that it needs to be placed in admin-only mode before rolling back the patch. 3. The user uses the CLI tool to restart the target process. Upon restart the rolled back patch is no longer visible in the runtime. h1. Patch File A patch file is a zip archive that contains a patch.xml file that is used to describe the patch along with the updated modules, OSGi bundles and miscellaneous files that comprise the patch. It's structure is as follows: + META-INF ++ patch.xml + modules ++ patch modules in the same structure as they appear the modules dir in the normal AS dist + bundles ++ patch bundles in the same structure as they appear the bundles dir in the normal AS dist + misc ++ misc files that need to be updated, organized in a directory structure that matches the directory structure of the AS dist h3. The patch.xml File The patch.xml file describes the patch. It includes basic information about the patch along with metadata about the modules, bundles and misc files in the patch. h5. Basic patch metadata * The name of the patch * The type of the patch (one-off vs cumulative, etc -- TODO list all) * The version to which the patch applies * A text description of the patch * TODO others h5. Module metadata * The name of the module * The slot of the module * The hash of the module.xml file of the previous version of the module. Not present if the relevant module did not exist in the version being patched. h5. Removed module metadata Identifies modules that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed module * The slot of the removed module h5. Bundle metadata * TODO anything? h5. Removed bundle metadata Identifies bundles that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The name of the removed bundle h5. Misc file metadata * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * The hash of the version of the file that was in the version being patched. Not present if the relevant file did not exist in the version being patched. * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h5. Removed misc file metadata Identifies misc files that were available in the version being patched but which should no longer be accessible once the patch is applied * The path of the misc file, relative to the root of the AS distribution * A boolean indicator as to whether the file is in active use by a non-admin-mode Host Controller or server h2. Patch Staging The target process when it applies a patch will create a patches directory directly underneath the root of the AS distribution.

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [jBPM Development] - Thread Pool - JBPM 5.3</header>
    <body>I am evaluating jbpm for workflow management in a simple java container.  One of the issues I am having trouble researching is multi threading.  When I kick off 100 workflows in my test script.  They are all handled on one thread "pool-1-thread-1".  I was assuming that I could set a max thread on the session or something similar to allow these workflows to be processed using multiple threads.  Here are my attempts.  Please help with any other feedback. 1.  I read about jbpm.cfg.xml and including jbpm.jobexecutor.cfg.xml on a 4.x discussion.  I cannot find this documentation for 5.3 and when I place these files in my classpath, It does not seem to be picked up.  Can this be used? jbpm.cfg.xml   jbpm.jobexecutor.cfg.xml &lt;process-engine-context&gt;        &lt;job-executor threads="4" idle="15000" idle-max="60000" lock-millis="3600000" /&gt;  &lt;/process-engine-context&gt; 2.  Create a StatefullKnowledgeSession for each thread that I want and distribute the processes on each session.  -  I am able to get this to work, just is a lot of management on my part and if you want the thread to end (usually in my test cases), you have to dispose of the session, but only after all jobs are finished executing, which is again a lot more code clutter that I would suspect you should not have to write.   Thanks for your time, Ed &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;    &lt;jbpm-configuration&gt;      &lt;import xresource="jbpm.jobexecutor.cfg.xml" /&gt;    &lt;/jbpm-configuration&gt;</body>

The first is the problem that we have been sending malformed messages for some time. The second is that since the upgrade to CXF 2.4.9, this issue was not tolerated. In the long term we need to fix the message, but that may not be possible in the short term as we may not be able to get this fix into the release that needs it. Do you know what has changed in CXF to cause this issue and do you know of a work-around? For the original issue see here:  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1275 https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1275 Thanks, Paul.</body>

    <body>This is the first time I've tried to pull down all of the drools/jbpm projects from github and build. I'm following the instructions in droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap ( https://github.com/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/blob/master/README.md https://github.com/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/blob/master/README.md), but run into a NoSuchCompilerException Exception when building the jbpm-human-task-hornetq project. I tried deleting the cloned jbpm repository and recloning, but I get the same error. Any thoughts as to why this is happening? Here's the stack trace from the attempted build: [INFO] [INFO] ----------</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Jboss 7.1.1 Final : JAX-WS : WebServiceContext.messageContext null</header>
    <body>Hi everybody, I am trying to use a JAX-WS Webservice in JBoss 7.1.1 Final. Webservice is working on Websphere 7, 8 and JBoss 5.1. When calling the context.getMessageContext(), I get the following error, because WebServiceContext.messageContext is null : My CommonWSActivityBean : My Webservice : web.xml : standalone.xml : I don't have jax-ws-*.jar in my WEB-INF/lib or in standalone/lib/ext. I tried to put the @Resource on the setContext() instead of context. I tried without the private keyworrd. Why is the WebServiceContext not filled / injected ? Thanks for your help.</body>

    <body>Hi James. I think your issue and my issue are different problems. The common is only we both using remote EJB client.

    <body>It's duplicate of :   https://community.jboss.org/thread/204487 *https://community.jboss.org/thread/204487* Hi,     You are trying to create/get the   *MessageContext*  at the time of initializing the WebService (this is due to @PostConstruct) , which is wrong because At the time of  WebService Instantiation it is in illegal state of providing you the MessageContext   Once a WebService client invokes a webservice operation then MessageContext can be retrieved.     So remove the @PostConstruct from your init(), Because when your WebService will be constructed at that time it is wrong to expect that your webservice will receive a HttpRequest so you can not get a webservice request for a Non WebService Method.     Also as you have mentioned the init()  method as a *NON-Web Method* by excluding it to appear in the WSDL.  Which means any WebService can not send a request to invoke it.   So if any client will not be able to invoke your init() then it is totally wrong to expect  getting a HttpRequest  inside this method.

If you are trying to adapt an UI that was built for another process engine you should: 1) Set up jbpm5 in the right way to be able to support the process execution + replace the API calls 2) fill all the VOs/DTOs that the other process engine is using to send to the UI with the information that you can get from jBPM5 3) see which bits were hardcoded by the other process engine to make the UI to work With that you will be fine</body>

    <body>Hi Tom, I'm also using vaadin. Currently i'm looking for a way to integrate jbpm 5.3 in my app using spring. I want to use jbpm to manage workflows. I used jbpm version before in a spring managed webapp. But jbpm 5.3 differs totally from version 3 and there is no example of how to integrate 5.3 with spring. I have in my own way integrated spring with vaadin so that it resembles a swing app. Maybe we can form a group to storm the developers in creating an spring jbpm integration example.</body>

    <body>Hi everybody, I'm using jbossesb 4.2. I try to run the webservice_proxy_basic in quickstart sample. It runs ok. But when I go to  http://localhost:8080/contract http://localhost:8080/contract. I see: * *Endpoint*:  http://127.0.0.1:8080/Quickstart_webservice_proxy_b/http/Proxy_Basic/Proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080/Quickstart_webservice_proxy_b/http/Proxy_Basic/Proxy * *Contract*:  http://127.0.0.1:8080/Quickstart_webservice_proxy_b/http/Proxy_Basic/Proxy?wsdl http://127.0.0.1:8080/Quickstart_webservice_proxy_b/http/Proxy_Basic/Proxy?wsdl I click this link but it's not found.

But when using SOAP UI to test this service. The soap response always contain the error: HTTP Status 404 - /Quickstart_webservice_proxy_b/http/Proxy_Basic/Proxy I wonder why JbossESB remove 3 characters at the ending of esb  app deployment that cause the error.

    <body>Sorry, I have tried this as standalone. By mistake I have posted in JBoss AS7 space. I have taken the quick start example given in Infinispan( *https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-quickstart infinispan-quickstart*) Tutorial of disributed and replicated clustering and executed in my local machine. When I ran the Node0, Node1 and Node2, it is identified that cluster is not getting formed. I have executed the code without modifying anything including configuration files. I have tried by building the cache manager from code and from configuration files and facing the same issues.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss Transactions Development] - Re: JBoss Transaction Not Active - EJB 2.1 in JBOSS EAP 5.1.2</header>
    <body>Hi Michael, I have not looked up if transaction still exists but what i know its not active anymore due to an ejb auto commit through ejbStore. I believe this is a flaw on our system on why do we have a DB logic inside a passivate call (I think this is not a normal case). Since I know that at ejbPassivate I dont have anymore transaction active, what i did was to create a new bean that has its own transaction. I created a stateless session bean that has its own db call and call this bean inside the passivate. Thanks for your help again. If i find out more, will let you know.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - How to make libs.jar accessible to both EJBs and WebApp?</header>
    <body>Anyone know how to resolve this?  FYI- Running AS7 I have EAR----------      app.war      libs.jar      ejb1.jar      ejb2.jar EAR---------- Now inside my app.war WAR---------      WEB-INF           classes           lib WAR--------- Problem- classes inside the app.war cannot see my libs.jar. Poor workaround - An easy way to fix this is to just redundantly add libs.jar to the lib directory but then it's redundantly in two places(EAR and WAR). Is there a more elegant way to permit the class files inside the war to see the libs.jar?</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: How to make libs.jar accessible to both EJBs and WebApp?</header>
    <body>Place libs.jar in EAR/lib, and then it will be visible to all your wars and EJB jars (this is part of the EE6 standard).</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [JBoss AS 7 Development] - Re: How to make libs.jar accessible to both EJBs and WebApp?</header>
    <body>Yes, thanks! h4. How to Package EARs and WARs When you migrate your application, you may have to change the packaging structure of your EAR or WAR due to the class loading changes. A WAR is a single module and all classes in the WAR are loaded with the same class loader. This means classes packaged in the WEB-INF/lib are treated the same as classes in WEB-INF/classes. An EAR is different in that it consists of multiple modules. The EAR/lib directory is a single module, and every WAR or EJB jar deployment is also a separate module. Classes will not necessarily have access to other classes in the EAR unless explicit dependencies have been defined. For more information on EAR and WAR packaging, see "WAR Class Loading" and "EAR Class Loading" in  https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Class+Loading+in+AS7 Class Loading in AS7.</body>

    <header>[jboss-dev-forums] [Clustering Development] - Programatically identifying master/slave nodes in JBoss AS 7.1</header>
    <body>Is there an API available, which can tell me if the current node (on which this piece of code is running) is a master or a slave? Probably, in most cases, you dont care, but say if you dont implement a ha singleton service, but want to execute some code only on the master (or only one salve) node(s). How do the various UIs for JBoss monitoring get this information from JBoss AS? Similarly how to identify whether the node is running in a standalone mode or a domain cluster mode. I looked at JBoss AS clustering code and I couldnt find and API that can give this information. I looked at the GroupCommunicationService class and the MBeanServer class and they dont have this information. Is there any way I could query and get this information from JBOSS? Thanks!</body>
