    <header>Externally activated (global) rules</header>
    <body>Hi! I have a use-case where I need to enable rules based on external parameters. Therefore I cannot activate them in code. I have submitted a pull request:  There are some little things to fix but its an easy and functional extension. Anyone mind to fix the code to a state that will get merged? I did not get any feedback until now. Whole team in holidays? Also I am wondering when 4.12 will be released. Any plans? Regards and thank you! Henning.</body>

    <body>Henning, Sorry for the lack of response. JUnit is maintained by volunteers, and sometimes our day jobs get busy. I was waiting for David to respond (I am a sometimes contributor) but here are my thoughts. This is an interesting idea. Note that you could get what you want with a custom runner. My concern with adding Rules via system properties that someone running the tests in their IDE would see different results compared to the test runs from Maven. Sure, you could tell your IDE to run the tests with the same system properties, but it would be unexpected for most people to have to take a special step to make the tests run the same way as they did in the continuous build. Could you find some way to define the global rules via code? Perhaps you could add a DynamicRule to all of your tests that could apply the addition rules. Alternatively, you could have a class in the same package as the tests that defined the global rules for tests in that package (though I'm not sure there is a platform-independent way to scan all of the classes in a package that works for all runtime/deployment environments) -- Kevin</body>

    <header>Re: Externally activated (global) rules</header>
    <body>Hi Kevin! Thank you very much for your feedback! First some words to the environment: In the project I need the feature we currently have 9 developers and it might be more. Even freelancers. There are something around 20k tests. What we want to achieve is to enable a global timeout rule that applies different timeouts to tests depending on their category (eg SlowTests.class may take longer than other tests). Also there are other things to take into consideration (eg is some context already loaded, otherwise the timeout will be increased). This rule already exists and is registered in some abstract base class. Its working fine. Having this amount of tests makes it very hard to make sure that every class is annotated with it. Also not all tests inherit from the abstract test class and I would like to keep it that way. It would be just some work to put the rule in every test but what about tests written in the future. I need to make sure that the rule is applied to every test especially when the developer forgets about it. Its a rule that is intended to avoid developers slowing down jenkins build by writing slow tests without annotating them as such. That said using a different runner is not an option. Also we already have a hard time mixing spring-runner, mockito-runner, junitparam-runner (btw we/you should copy some of that behaviour as it is a lot more flexible than junit parameterized test [1])) aso-behaviour (btw: we/you need to think about the runner-concept. it would be a lot better to have one runner and registering behaviour to it (eg being able to register as many "runners" as I want to). Scanning classpath is a good thing. We already use classpathsuite [2]. That enables us to create suites without having to specify all classes in it (another feature that would very well fit junit). We could for example annotate a rule with a classifier (basepacke, package or package.classname) and it would get applied to everything that matches. But this kind of behaviour would introduce a completely new way of configuration to junit (a little cdi/spring-ish). Maybe it would be a good idea to overthink the junit-concept leading this direction anyway but I get the feeling its a little too much for this concern. At last I do not think the external switch is a problem as its highly optional. If you use it, you know what you are doing. Dont you think so? [1] [2]</body>

    <header>Re: Externally activated (global) rules</header>
    <body>Hello, Are you using maven? If so, one option that you could possibly consider is using a different provider to surefire. A provider is a class which knows how to run a set of tests. There is a provider for JUnit3, JUnit pre 4.7 and JUnit post 4.7. JUnit post 4.7 uses the JUnitCore, which you could replace with your own version, which inserts the same rule everywhere. It seems (at first glance) to be a better way to get global behaviour from your jenkins server. Matthew Farwell.</body>

    <header>JUnit 4.12 issue when using theory + enum type + DataPoint that contains a null</header>
    <body>Hi, I have a Theory with a parameter list that includes a String, a boolean, and an enum. The latter 2 should be automatically assigned and should not need any explicit @DataPoint declaration (per the release note description below. When I run the test, the enum param is assigned the null value instead of being assigned each value of the enum, and I'm not sure why this is not working for me. I would appreciate any help you can offer, please. I cloned master from here: ...and looked at the JUnit 4.12 release notes: ...and scrolled-down to pull request #654 which says: "Any theory method parameters with boolean or enum types that can't be supplied with values by any other sources will be automatically supplied with default values: true and false, or every value of the given enum. If other explicitly defined values are available (e.g. from a specified ParameterSupplier or some DataPoints method in the theory class), only those explicitly defined values will be used." On that same release notes page, I also see the comment under pull request #549, which says that a @DataPoint-annotated array field can contain null values. So here's my test: @RunWith(Theories.class) ...and here's the output: windows:true:null windows:false:null linux:true:null linux:false:null null:true:null null:false:null ...which is not what I expected... I expected the 3rd value to be JDK6 or JDK7. I run a 2nd test, but this time I remove the null array element from the 'platforms' field, and the results are expected: @RunWith(Theories.class) ...which results in: windows:true:JDK6 windows:true:JDK7 windows:false:JDK6 windows:false:JDK7 linux:true:JDK6 linux:true:JDK7 linux:false:JDK6 linux:false:JDK7 Cool. But now just for fun, I remove the 'platform' param from testFoo and I restore the null array element to 'platforms' field. Since there is no longer any String param in the param list (and since String is a final class so there's no possibility of an assignable subclass), I expect that the 'platforms' DataPoint will just be silently ignored and I would get the expected output. But I actually see the unexpected output, as if a null array element that exists in a field (that's not even used in the Theory's param list) is affecting the values of a totally different type, the enum type (causing the enum param to receive only a null value): @RunWith(Theories.class) ...which results in: true:null false:null Maybe I'm missing something? Thank  you. Cheers, Will</body>

    <header>Out of Mem when using @DataPoints with Iterator type, request lazy fetch</header>
    <body>Hi, I see that in the current master branch of JUnit, the JUnit 4.12 release notes say: Fantastic. To me this means that we can now have something similar to TestNG's DataProvider that returns an 'Iterator&amp;lt;Object[]&amp;gt;' ( then ...but just one problem -- the JUnit Iterable @DataPoints doesn't seem to get the data lazily... it looks like it slurps everything into memory before passing it to the Theory test. I'd like to request that we please change the implementation of this method so that the data is ingested lazily (one element at a time, or maybe in batches) to avoid OOME.

    <header>Re-licensing from CPL to EPL (again)</header>
    <body>Hi There are several cases (at least NetBeans and OpenJDK) where JUnit can't be used because it's CPL and EPL would be fine. To sum up: - EPL is the latest version of CPL (yes, it's a bit confusing at first) - Since EPL is a more recent version of CPL relicensing does _not_ require approval from all contributors (Section 7 of the CPL) - The difference between CPL is the removal of one sentence. It relates to the scope of patent licenses terminated should someone sue another party for patent infringement. You can find more information at [1], [2], [3] and look at a diff of the licenses at [4]. On an unrelated note after tying to set up a Yahoo Groups account I hope that Yahoo goes bust.

    <header>Timed Tests and Thread Safety</header>
    <body>Hi All, I've been using timed tests (i.e. @Test(timeout = ...)) for years but recently came across an implementation detail of which I was unaware.  While I knew that timed tests are run in a thread other than the main test thread, I assumed that all aspects of the test (set up, test, and tear down) were run in that other thread.  I was surprised to discover that the set up and tear down methods are run on the main test thread, while the test method is run on a different thread. This jumped out at me in a recent programming session because the class under test uses thread isolation to achieve thread safety, and its methods liberally assert that they are invoked on the same thread on which the object was instantiated.  Once I realized why my timed tests were failing unexpectedly, I worked around the problem by moving the necessary portions of my set up and tear down to the test method itself. However, this got me thinking about more subtle issues related to timed tests of code that is inherently NOT thread safe.  Consider the following contrived example, where Bar is the class under test: When testSomethingOnMainThread() is run, I expect the Foo instance created in the test will have its dispose() method called in tearDown() because its assignment to the Bar.foo field occurs on the same thread that invokes tearDown(). However, when testSomethingOnDifferentThread() is run, I expect the Foo instance created in the test MAY NOT have its dispose() method called in tearDown() because its assignment to the Bar.foo field occurs on a different thread than the one that invokes tearDown().  Without some kind of memory barrier, the Bar.foo field may not be safely published from the test thread to the main thread. My concern is that there could be a significant change in the behavior of a test simply by annotating it with a timeout when the code under test is not thread safe.  I can't be the first person to ask this question (I apologize  if my search of this group's archives was not thorough enough), so I realize my entire premise may be ill-posed or that I'm missing some fundamental understanding of the Java memory model. With that said, is it reasonable to expect that, for a given @Test, all @Before and @After methods in the fixture be called on the same thread regardless of how the test is annotated?  Or is it simply up to the programmer to be aware of how timed tests are implemented, and to make it their responsibility to ensure code that is not thread safe is only ever invoked on a single thread, or to use external synchronization to ensure safe publication between threads? Cheers, Steve</body>

    <header>Re: Timed Tests and Thread Safety</header>
    <body>Steve, You raise a great question.  Unfortunately, and perhaps I'm missing something obvious, I don't think there's a way to provide timeout semantics, guarantee that @After is called, and guarantee that @After is called on the same thread as the @Test method.  Essentially, once the runner hands over control to the @Test thread, there's no guarantee that it will ever return control back--it could go into an infinite loop that catches InterruptedExceptions. It would potentially be possible to guarantee that successful tests that complete within the timeout have @After methods called on the same thread, but that would further complicate matters, with questionable (IMHO) payoff. The biggest payoff would probably be to make sure that the documentation we have makes it easy to avoid any unexpected behavior.  Can you suggest an edit to that effect?  Thanks,</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Timed Tests and Thread Safety</header>
    <body>Why not? When you find a @Test(timeout=...), create a thread, run the @Before method in it, then the test method, then the @After method, all in that thread. You can detect if the test times out and still be able to run the @After in that same thread after the InterruptedException kicks in. -- Cédric</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Timed Tests and Thread Safety</header>
    <body>Note the Timeout rule will call @Before and @After methods in the same thread as the test. The test class is created before rules are applied, so if your test class initializes fields at declaration time, that execution would happen in a different thread than the test. I also believe that @After methods would not be called for tests methods that timeout in classes that use the Timeout rule. - Kevin</body>

    <header>Re: Timed Tests and Thread Safety</header>
    <body>@Kevin: I feel like a fool.  I actually "discovered" rules during this exercise and spent some time changing legacy @Test(timeout = ...) tests to use a fixture-level Timeout @Rule.  However, I just assumed that the threading behavior between the two was the same. :(  Based on your information, I ran some more tests to nail down on which thread the various parts of the fixture are executed using both models.  The results are summarized below (from JUnit 4.8.2). Given these results, using Timeout @Rules satisfies my concerns about thread safety and gives me even more motivation to use them over @Test(timeout = ...). Thanks!  (Note sure if item [B4] is intentional, but I can live with it for now.) @David: Your suggestion for updating the documentation is probably the best solution based on the preferred behavior of the Timeout @Rule.  Below is my cut at a second paragraph I'd add to the Javadocs for the @Test annotation's timeout element.  Please edit as you see fit. thread other than the thread which runs the fixture's @Before and @After methods.  This may yield different behavior for code that is not thread safe when compared to the same test method without a timeout parameter.  Consider using the org.junit.rules.Timeout rule instead, which ensures a test method is run on the same thread as the fixture's @Before and @After methods. Thanks again for all the feedback, Steve</body>

    <body>Hi Kristian, ( used as a replacement for @Category(mycategory.class). So you basically can make your own @IntegrationTest annotation. standardized tool implemented ? One possibility (that I'm toying with an another domain) is to use a meta-annotation like @CategoryAnnotation.  Any annotation that is itself annotated with @CategoryAnnotation is a category annotation. So you could declare: @CategoryAnnotation @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Documented Then you could mark any test: @IntegrationTest @Test Perhaps @CategoryAnnotation would require its target to take a few parameters, such as a description. These meta-annotations can be slightly dizzying for some programmers, but they sure make the test annotations cleaner Of course, for this to work, the framework would have to recognize @CategoryAnnotation and its meaning.

    <header>Re: Re: Alternate @Category annotations</header>
    <body>Sorry to come in late on the discussion. I've generally been against the idea of meta-annotations.  I understand that they can simplify things, but they also greatly raise the number of classes that someone investigating a test failure for the first time has to look at to understand exactly what's going on. That said, I don't want to _ban_ having enough rope to hang oneself, I just try to stay out of the rope-selling business.  So how can we allow teams that would want such a thing to get it done?  This enables a standard syntax for giving JUnit a string that specifies a filter.  With that in place, once the --filter syntax is supported by Eclipse, surefire, etc, it should open up a path for third parties to implement Filters in whatever form they wish, and users could just include the third-party jar to get meta-annotation filtering or whatever else they want.</body>

    <header>should @Ignore processing and Filter processing be combined?</header>
    <body>This topic started from  Full disclosure: I'm for combining such processing since my group uses Filter notification to know which tests are being skipped in CI while allowing such tests to be run on dev machines. Our goal is to eliminate such tests, but exposure of those tests is required to achieve this goal. The following (especially the cons since I'm biased and there's lots about JUnit I don't yet understand) will likely be missing items but I'll try to be fair about them. If there's anything missing, I'm sure people will jump in. Pro's: * Simpler code. @Ignore processing would simply be just another filter. Existing duplicate code to check for @Ignore annotations will disappear. * Conceptually simpler. @Ignore and Filters aren't two separate things with different hard-coded nuances. Con's: * Slower performance. Since notifications will have to be made, the set of tests to be run can't be culled down. Such slower performance is theoretical and ought to be measured. Potential alternatives: * Have an option (somewhere) that allows notification for filtered tests. * Have a fireFiltered() method for notifiers. I think this would still require changes to AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder.runnerForClass() such that it returns something similar to IgnoredClassRunner for tests that are filtered out. Noel</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: should @Ignore processing and Filter processing be combined?</header>
    <body>It sounds like you either want Categories, have your own annotation and write a custom Filter. Another option would be to write a method that checks an environment variable or system property and based on the results optionally calls Assume.assumeTrue(false). But they currently *do* have different nuances. Filtered tests do not show up in the Description tree; Ignored tests do. JUnit provides notifications when "running" an ignored test; no notification exists for filtering tests. They are also semantically different IMHO. @Ignore is a code-level indication to never run a test. Filtering is a way to run a subset of the tests. It sounds like you want tests that are run in some environments and not others; I think Ignore is a poor choice because it doesn't allow you to specify which environments you want to run them in. Again, I would use Categories or a custom annotation and a filter. Filtering can happen before RunNotifiers are added. One way to filter is to create a Request, and then call Request.filterWith(), and then run the tests. When you filter a request, the filtered items vanish from the Runner/Description tree. It would be hard to change that behavior without breaking existing users. -- Kevin</body>

    <body>You should really ask on a java mailing list since this really has nothing really to do with jUnit. You could also search for the answers too. The problem is that the code you have added is not anywhere in the processing flow. Java is not top down executed; in this code the main method is run, your added code needs to go within the main method to be executed:- // placing your additions here would be a good place. // placing your additions here would be a good place. // placing your additions here would be a good place. With the code placed as it is, your compile should be complaining about 'misplaced constructs" or similar. But there are more problems if the code your are compiling and running really looks like this.

    <body>We're currently looking at making some changes to how theory datapoint-generating methods fail.

    <header>Annotation driven Junit Test cases</header>
    <body>Hi, My team has recently started work on trying to extend Junit to support all inclusive annotation driven testing of a method in Java. What I mean is that if we have a method public int add(int a ,int b) then, instead of having to write a separate class for testing it, we would like to annotate the method as follows @AutoTest @InputParams @AutoAssert public int add(int a,int b) The responsibility of setting up junit to understand and execute this set of annotation would be delegated t our custom Runner. The example above is quite basic as we plan to support testing for complex input objects that are seeded using an XML file. We are in pretty advanced stages of completing this implementation. Please let me know how can we share our code for approvals/reviews with the Junit community. Thanks, SG</body>

    <header>Help with junit.org</header>
    <body>Hi, team JUnit. A quick recap: late last year, the organization that had been hosting junit.org for us (a group of stalwarts that started at ObjectMentor) lost their serving files, apparently effectively irrevocably.  Since then: 1) I've taken ownership of the junit.org domain on behalf of the JUnit organization. 2) We've transfered the github repo to the junit-team team account. I think the best place to end up would be to serve junit.org from github pages at junit-team.github.com/junit.  I've begun taking steps in this direction, but could use help navigating the DNS and github-administration tasks involved. My guess is that with one or two focused volunteers, we can get the major issues knocked out in under a week.  Anyone up for the challenge? Thanks,</body>

The text in @ThreadSafe is similar to the one in original jcip. Although i would omit mentioning modifier "public" since the all problem of thread safety is in fields which are read or write in critical section=methods/constructor. So the modifier may not necessarily be public. It can be also protected, etc. So better not to mention any modifier in the text. Let's wait for other repliers and then to make a new deployment.

Although I am the one who originally suggested we use ThreadSafe from jcip-annotations, I no longer feel that way. I think we should either have a JUnit-specific annotation or a create an abstract subclass of RunListener. If we create our own annotation, I strongly feel that it should not be named ThreadSafe (see my comments in the Google docs page for more details)  edit# -- Kevin  edit#</body>

    <header>Re: Feedback requested: Impending changes to RunListener</header>
    <body>Hi All, I am open for declaring @ThreadSafe in JUnit bundle due to the reasons like the other artifacts are project or person specific in Maven central and license issues. But I am not open for @Concurrent. The @ThreadSafe is the strongest terminology. One day if we will have both, it will be just confusing. If we now take over Stephen's class javadoc, we have to copy the Apache License. I think we do not have to follow the jcip either Stephan's definition of thread-safety in the annotation. We can follow the general definition "to be free of data race conditions". Simply see the wikipedia. And what this definition really means has to be specified in the class which allows thread-safety treatments.  Therefore the RunListener has to say in javadoc that it can be annotated @ThreadSafe if its use pattern satisfies reasonable expectations of thread safety. So RunListener allows using this annotation. Now we can talk about these expectations. I think they will be these and maybe you can add yours: + If RunListener is created in T1, values in the variables initialized by the constructor which are (indirectly) read in public methods have proper + All public methods in RunListener can be called in T2, or more threads at the + RunListener must not achieve non-deterministic nor invalid state. What is your opinion about this approach? Cheers, Tibor  edit#  edit#</body>

In one sense, the easiest way to get started is to have Maven generate the whole site... though it is not always the prettiest. If you go for Maven generating the whole site I would recommend the main index be generated using the ugly as heck xdoc format and use markdown for the rest of the non-automatic pages. the xdoc format will let you customize the generated HTML much more, and allow a nicer looking front page. Also I would favour the fluido skin (i.e. bootstrap based) If you would rather the root be just regular html, then I will set up the Maven site to push to a sub-directory instead. -Stephen</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Feedback requested: Impending changes to RunListener</header>
    <body>Hi, all. Kevin, thank you very much for the summary document.  I think that a JUnit-specific annotation, which is not name-confusable with a standard like @ThreadSafe, seems to be a pretty clear winner.  If we feel strongly that it should remain consonant with @ThreadSafe, we could make it a static inner annotation, and reference it as @RunListener.ThreadSafe.  That might also have the advantage of making clear that it's a single-purpose annotation (I'd rather not, at this point, start speculatively figuring out what other interfaces might try to pun meanings onto a general-purpose ThreadSafe annotation) I'm a little curious about the third-party library implementation.  Let's say I write a package FooTest which is compiled against JUnit 4.12, and it contains a FooListener I'd like to mark threadsafe.  A client wants to use it with JUnit 4.11 (she knows she won't get the concurrent performance boost, but wants it to just work).  The document seems to assume that if FooListener has a RunListener.TheadSafe annotation, then our client won't have a problem (unless, likely, she actually tries to instantiate all of the annotations from FooListener in her own code).  However, the document assumes that declaring a marker interface ThreadSafeRunListener _would_ break the client.  Is that true?  Does FooListener fail at bytecode verification because the verifier wants to make sure that it implements all of ThreadSafeRunListener's methods? Thanks,  edit#  edit#</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Feedback requested: Impending changes to RunListener</header>
    <body>I'm personally find with that as long as the JavaDoc for the annotation makes it clear that a RunListener implementation annotated with that interface will be treated differently than one not annotated with that interface when addListener() and removeListener() is called. Correct as of JDK 1.5.0_06. See  -a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime It sounds that if the client wants to write code that extends FooListener then JUnit 4.12 will need to be on the compile-time classpath I believe it would result in a NoClassDefFoundError exception. It should be easy to verify. Note that it may be hard to write a library that has a compile-time dependency on JUnit 4.12 while being runtime compatible with 4.11 for other reasons. Does FooListener fail at bytecode That would be my guess. -- Kevin</body>

    <header>Re: Feedback requested: Impending changes to RunListener</header>
    <body>David, I can confirm that running annotated listener in 4.11 and compiled with 4.12 does not throw exception. So the annotation is winner in my eyes. Regarding the static inner annotation in RunListener, this would mean that other classes which will maybe later need the same name of annotation will just duplicate again.

    <header>Re: Re: Feedback requested: Impending changes to RunListener</header>
    <body>Remember, this annotation changes the behavior of JUnit will have when interacting with classes that extend RunListener. It's not simply an indication that the listener is thread-safe (though your listener would have to be thread-safe to use this annotation). See my comments in  ThreadSafe annotation would be problematic I'm personally not too worried about what might happen if we need to think about indicating the thread-safety of extension points somewhere else in JUnit. We could easily support multiple annotations in the future if we need to, and when that time comes, perhaps JSR-305 will be more mature. -- Kevin  -a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime</body>

    <body>Sorry in advance if this is "too wordy". Getting an API correct is hard work, and the discussion helps. Given the thread so far, I'd be highly surprised if we decided to add a new dependency. If we go with using an annotation, we would have an annotation provided with JUnit that you could use. Does that change your view? RunListener is an abstract class, not an interface (which has been handy when we've wanted to add new notification methods) so I'm not sure if having a ThreadSafeRunListener interface makes sense. We could have ThreadSafeRunListener which is a subclass of RunListener with no additional methods. Fixing one without fixing the other is actually harder than fixing them both. If there's a concern that we could break existing uses, we can ping the thread when the changes stabilize a bit more. I'm not sure I agree (but I'm very interested in others thoughts). JUnit is used by all types of users, from novice to advanced. It is often the first and only third-party library a novice user uses. Novice users are highly likely to not handle thread-safety issues. Thread-safety issues in a listener could lead to all sorts of confusing results. I think we need to make it easy for novice users to add listeners without worrying about thread-safety issues, and possible for advanced users to have thread-safe listeners. We could limit the scope of the lock we use for non-thread-safe listeners. Currently, it's essentially a global lock. We could make the lock per-listener, but that might result in user-visible behavior changes. Thanks for the feedback. Keep it coming! -- Kevin</body>

    <body>Hi Kevin, I'm about to board a plane, but I took a look at the code on the way to the airport. I wonder if you could serialize the events on a separate thread that is the only thread that writes to the RunListeners. Multiple threads could deposit events in a concurrent collection. The lone dedicated thread could take events out and one one thread write them to listeners. I do something like that in ScalaTest in this class:  est/DispatchReporter.scala In the case of RunNotifier, it is a bit more complicated because the listeners to report to can change over time whereas in my case this is immutable. But still I think you could use a similar technique. I'm not familiar with what ParallelComputer is, so maybe this wouldn't work. But I thought I'd suggest it.

    <header>Re: Feedback requested: Impending changes to RunListener</header>
    <body>That would indeed reduce the difference between the two aproaches. The difference I still see is that the annotation is more general.  You can use it at other places in the API if needed.   This is good if you think it would be usefull in multiple place in the API.  However, if it is supported in only one place, it might raise useless questions when implementing/extending other interfaces.  The implementer might ask himself if he should write thread safe code with that annotation or if it doesn't mather for this interface. Other differences are that the annotation is less intrusive than the taging interface that is a little bit old school. Given that, I'm now thinking that annotation is a good idea, but a bigger work.  I think for the annotation you should review the documention of the entire API to document where it applies. Is the RunListener for novice ;-) Anyway, even non novice might have issues to implement a thread safe class.  So I understand your concern.  But anyway, here also, you will need to document very well the locking aproach. Gilles</body>

To push to github, you need to add a few tweaks to the pom: * You need to set the &amp;lt;url&amp;gt; to the URL that the site will end up on:  * You need to add the equivalent &amp;lt;site&amp;gt; stuff, e.g.  * You need to add the Maven wagon for deploying to a github hosted site, e.g. * Note: I also add a Markdown doxia module so that I can write the pages in markdown I think that is all you need to do. Then anyone with commit access to the  the Maven generated site (which would include the javadocs) just runs mvn site-deploy Everything else is magic. (There may be an entry in your settings.xml that would be required also) We could make the site URL versioned, that would mean that the site would contain javadocs for each version, or we could have Jenkins push the site as well. -Stephen</body>

    <body>Hello there, I have used Stephen's general strategy as well, (manual entry page, Maven sites as directories beneath). The site distribution url is equal to Stephen's approach. As an alternative (not having tried Stephen's wagon), I have used the maven-scm-publish-plugin[1]. After the initial setup (see pom.xml[2] for an example), it is sufficient to execute sth. like `mvn clean verify site site:stage scm-publish:publish-scm` and you are set. The scm-publish plugin: - checks out the gh-pages branch in a directory beneath target - merges your staged site into this directory, - makes one commit and pushes The scm-publish:publish-scm is in my experience blazingly fast compared to deploying the site via wagon (I had tried this with SVN in the past and it was a real pain, but as I said I did not try Stephen's wagon for github :-)). Projects inheriting from a base pom use the same strategy for publishing the site, the only thing they have to define is a property called scmpublish.content[3]. Regards Mirko 1. 2. 3.

    <body>Hi all junit guys, Let me turn back to the original problem. We knew that it's a good idea to let the users to annotated a custom listener by @ThreadSafe if it's really thread-safe.

I am convinced that we should not make synchronized listener public since this is our internal patch.

    <body>Hi All, Stephan, I would also prefer javax package. Let's see this link wich is listing all artifacts having javax.**.ThreadSafe  I have also the same problem with their versions. My objection to these is that, there is no unique and final artifact related to JSR-305, and none of them has groupId "sun", "oracle", nor "javax". They may change as a long as the JSR changes. The JSR 305 is not final. Hopefully, the jcip is more considered standard and the version would not change. In worst case your Maven module will have two @ThreadSafe annotations on the top of listener's class including two packages. The license of jcip allows us to copy the content of the annotation, but I am not sure if we are allowed to repackage it. If not, I already submited ThreadSafe annotation in junit package  I am not mentioning this commit because it's mine, nothing but because this issue takes quite long and we freezed to resolve it. Having such annotation in JUnit package is also not the best idea. One solution of not being dependent on findbugs and net.jcip artifacts, either the JUnit annotation is to detect the annotation "javax.annotation.concurrent.ThreadSafe" as String : class name but not the class object itself. This allows us to be compatible with the Maven artifacts and the finalized JSR 305 in JDK. Of course we can add such maven dependency later and annotate JUnit classes ThreadSafe/NotThreadSafe in other pulls if we want to. But this is not our goal yet. Sounds promissing?

    <body>FYI, the code I mentioned that uses Filters for Categories support allows one to use properties to control which tests are run. For example "-Dtest.categories.include=**/A.class,**/B.class -Dtest.categories.exclude=**/C.class,**/D.class" would run tests that are categorized both as A and B but neither C nor D. No need to hand-craft Suites for each combination one may want. Fundamentals" started by Mark Levison has made it very clear that using Categories is not as easy as it should be. It (often) requires maintaining classic Suites by hand which is very cumbersome. Forgetting to add a new test to the SuiteClasses annotation is a common pitfall. category or name is something that does belong to the core. junit.contrib is a nice idea but so far there is no clear release model, no common licence and so on. JUnit core on the other hand, is a commonly used library.

It's not really a new feature in the sense "we can do new stuff" as it is "we can do stuff differently". Looking at lambdas certainly doesn't prevent fixing other things.

    <header>Re: Re: Is it Time for JUnit 5</header>
    <body>One of the things I would love to see in some upcoming JUnit version is some kind of feature introspection (I'll explain what I mean with that) in a moment. rationale: More than anything, JUnit is an integrationhub for running tests. All(?) IDE's support running JUnit tests in some way as well as buildtools, CI severs etc. One issue with JUnit4 has always been that IDEs can't keep up with JUnit and JUnit in turn is constrained with the current state of IDEs. It is hard for other tools to compete because JUnit is already there. "Feature introspection" It would be great if there was a way for 3rd part tools to ask JUnit for features. A basic feature could be "run all tests on classpath", or "run named test", "run category". As a 3rd party tool vendor I could then query JUnit for features and delegate more of the work to JUnit. If we take categories as an example. Today eclipse simply doesn't recognize them but with feature introspection it could just appear as a choice in a menu. A feature would have some basic categorization where some categories are well known such as "run" so that tools can logically present the basics. A feature would have some way to declare it's required input, referably with some types (like: A test, A category, A suite, A test with parameters etc, Needs a resultbuilder etc). A feature would have some way to describe itself "Runs the specified category of tests" A feature can be contributed by a 3rd party like a custom runner can. With features it would also open up new possibilities with tools like Ant, Maven, Gradle etc where features can be delegated to JUnit and it would be simpler to build and maintain testrelated tasks since they would not require to be available as compiled tasks before the build starts, extensions can be built and maintained in the same way as your tests until you want to share them with others. Admittedly this is an idea that is not finished. I'm basically aiming at bridging the gap a bit between 3rd party tools and the JUnit core without having to implement UI and solve UX problems.

That's a faster timeframe than I was expecting. explains how someone can use RuntimeSuite and the existing features of JUnit to get what Mark's team originally wanted in Eclipse/maven/command-line/etc? I developed RuntimeSuite at a client who was just starting to use Maven.  We invoked the suite by configuring surefire like this: You could generalize that by using a property instead of naming a specific class. That's the extent of my understanding of how to use RuntimeSuite with Maven. So does that (admittedly minimal) guidance suffice for Maven? I have no idea what's required to integrate anything with Eclipse (or IntelliJ IDEA). At my client, we weren't doing anything trickier than configuring Maven to run our suite class.  We never, for example, used properties or command line args to configure finders and filters.  In fact, none of the finders and filters built into RuntimeSuite were configurable at runtime.  Everything they know, they know at compile time. That said, people /could/ implement their own finders and filters, configurable at runtime in whatever way suits them.  Because finders and filters are implemented as rules, you can hand their constructors any configuration options you desire, as long as you know how to get the options to the constructors.  (A simple matter of programming?) to "I'm glad this will get easier, but at least we're up and running".

    <body>Oh, I would also consider it aggressive as a target.  I was just pointing out that even the best-case scenario of getting code into JUnit would be an order of magnitude or two higher latency and effort than improving the documentation to point to existing, already-working solutions, so we should prioritize the doc upgrade. And it's only a shady memory to me, populated by phantoms and cold spectres. Which is why it would be good to try to get people who care about it to beta-test our documentation before there's hundreds of lines of code behind it.  :-)</body>

    <header>Feedback requested: Impending changes to RunListener</header>
    <body>Hello, everyone Short version: we are thinking of adding an optional dependency from JUnit to jcip-annotations and are soliciting feedback. A few people have noticed that when you use ParallelComputer, you got poor performance because calls to registered RunListeners are synchronized. We would like to fix this in the next release of JUnit. In order to prevent affecting existing users, we are proposing having an annotation that can be added to RunListener implementations that can safely be called concurrently from multiple threads. If a RunListener passed to a RunNotifier is not annotated with this annotation, JUnit will wrap it with a decorator that does synchronization. We would appreciate feedback on this new annotation. We have two options: a. Create our own annotation for this b. Use ThreadSafe (  t/jcip/annotations/ThreadSafe.java ) The advantages to option b are: 1. It's a well-known annotation 2. Users that use JUnit can add this annotation to their thread-safe RunListener implementations today and get the benefits "for free" later. Note we can do this without requiring that all users of JUnit have the jcip-annotations jar in their classpath as of JDK 1.5.0_06 (see  -a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime If jcip-annotations is not on the classpath then all RunListener implementations will be treated as not thread-safe. As a specific example, the Maven Surefire plugin would use this dependency and include jcip-annotations. Currently, JUnit only depends on one third-party library (Hamcrest). This has caused us some pain in the past when the Hamcrest code changed in ways that broke existing users of JUnit. We believe this will not be an issue with jcip-annotations because the JAR only contains annotations, not any code. One possible concern would be with other open source libraries that provide RunListener implementations (they would need to add jcip-annotations to their compile-time classpath if they have thread-safe annotations, and document this to their users). Thoughts? -- Kevin</body>

    <header>Re: Feedback requested: Impending changes to RunListener</header>
    <body>I like the idea, a lot! But would like to ask that only the *simple name* of the annotation is considered, without regard for the package in which it resides. This way one can: 1. Use an alternative third-party annotation, such as javax.annotation.concurrent.ThreadSafe from libraries like com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:1.3.9 and com.google.code.findbugs:annotations:2.0.1. 2. Define a private annotation, without adding _any_ additional dependency. I use javax.annotation.concurrent.ThreadSafe quite a lot in my own code, so (1) is quite important from my perspective. There are precedents for this approach: IIRC, Eclipse does something like this for variations on @Nullable and @Nonnull, whereas (again, IIRC) Findbugs handles two instances of @SuppressWarnings.

IOW the annotation does not need to be present when running, but does seem in some cases to be required when compiling classes that inherit from annotated code (because the compiler needs to inspect the meta annotations to see in the annotation is inherited or something like that) Might boil down to either some meta-annotation  or comparing annotations based on simpleName  t/jcip/annotations/ThreadSafe.java  -a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime</body>

    <body>It looks like jcip-annotations uses Creative Commons, which is not recommended to be used to license software. That pretty much seals it for me. So it looks like we will either go with our own annotation or allow any annotation named "ThreadSafe" (in which case, JUnit would have our own ThreadSafe annotation in an internal package). The only remaining question is whether people expect APIs to behave differently based on whether the objects passed to them are of types annotated with a ThreadSafe annotation. One of the things I like about the JUnit annotations is that someone can look at the JavaDoc of the annotation to get a very clear idea of what behavior JUnit will give to the class/method/field/parameter with that annotation, plus it's easy to see what classes/methods/etc have special behavior (unlike JUnit3 where some behavior was based on the name of the method) -- Kevin</body>

    <header>JUnit 5, Lambas and Fundamentals</header>
    <body>Gang - I realize that I don't commit here nor in NUnit, as a result I have a little street cred. Its been about 5yrs since I made a significant part of my living from writing code. Instead I spend most of my time and effort coaching and training clients on the basic Agile ideas. In the past few weeks I've spent a lot of time with a client that builds Java applications. This has brought me back to JUnit. I'm in shock, you're discussing how to use Lambda's well when some of the basic elements are hard to use correctly. Examples Categories - require a special runner and the use of suites; Parameterized Data - requires a special runner etc. The Categories is the worst one. The client had some slow tests that should be removed from their main unit test suite and run only on nightly builds. Over time they want to revisit the tests, speed them up (using Fake DB and In Memory streams etc). In the world of Nunit no problem we would just mark them as members of the category slow and run them separately on the build server. In JUnit the requirement to use suites for this capability was so painful that we just migrated the tests to a separate eclipse project. Their parameterized tests several were missing the annotations for the special test runner. There are a number of other small details where JUnit makes it a little harder than necessary to do the work. Suggestion before debating an attractive Lambda syntax, make the existing features easy to use. In addition take NUnit for spin you might find some good ideas on how to handle many of these details. -- Cheers Mark Levison</body>

    <body>In favor of JUnit, its core is pretty flexible and does allow implementing such categories.

It's a pity everyone seems to have their own solution of course. Here's mine -- randomizedtesting uses annotations to mark groups this is used for various things in practice (@Slow, @Nightly, @AwaitsFix, @WindowsOnly, custom groups can be added).

    <header>Re: JUnit 5, Lambas and Fundamentals</header>
    <body>If you are helping your teams become more agile, then hopefully they are running their tests in an IDE most of the time. If that's the case, I think selecting a class named "FastTests" and telling your IDE to run it as a test is easier than fiddling with your JUnit run configurations to specify which category to run. Yes, it involves writing a little bit of code to create the class, but it's thankfully very little code. Certainly, the documentation could be better, but the wiki is helping with that (please contribute if you can). As for parameterized data, I agree that this shouldn't require a different runner. Getting parameterized data to work with the same runner as for normal tests would probably require a major rewrite of a lot of the core JUnit code. If there is a JUnit5 that introduces a different runner model, we should definitely re-think how parameterized tests are modeled. -- Kevin</body>

    <body>Kevin, Colin and anyone else who is interested, Let's imagine the scenario here. I show up at client site as part of a two week engagement. During the 3 days of training we discuss Hill's definition of a Microtest; SPiFFy; etc. Now they all understand no **good** unit test touches the file system, database, network etc. In addition they've groked the value of creating only a small object graph for each test, max 7-8 objects. Here comes the hard part, they've got legacy code. They sincerely want to do good stuff going forward, but their tests take ~25 minutes to run. Profiling indicates that there are ~35 tests over ~20 test classes that are slow. In almost every case slow tests are mixed in with fast tests. In addition many of these slow tests could be made fast (and more valuable) if we just made some clever use of fakes. However this changeover will take easily a couple of months of part time effort. In the world of NUnit we would just mark these as members of the category slow. In JUnit we either: As it stands I can waste alot of time with a client trying to overcome this issue when we should be practicing TDD, Mikado method, etc. Again my key point for JUnit 5 before discussing new things like Lambda's I think the challenge should be to make the existing functionality as simple to use as possible.

    <body>I would also like a chance to define categories to run through more simple means. Integrated IDE support would be nice of course, but something like parameter to set would help for starters. I do not use the suites or categories right now but I do have tests that are too slow for me to run all the time. I also do not want to maintain separate suite classes but rather prefer to just right-click on a package in IntelliJ and select "run tests". And repeating that from the menu if I so prefer.

    <body>Ok. I'm trying to understand what actually happens with NUnit. I mark a test as "slow", and run all of the tests in my project. Are you saying that without selecting the category of tests to run, the IDE doesn't run the slow tests, that is it only runs tests which are not marked as slow? If this is so, how does it know which are the slow tests? So, if I understand correctly, your goal here is to allow a user to mark a test as "slow" and from then on, if the user runs all tests in Eclipse, these tests get ignored. This would be achievable if we changed the eclipse plugin for JUnit, and wouldn't need a change to JUnit itself. You could have a set of categories to ignore when running the tests from Eclipse, which would be settable from the project properties or wherever.

    <header>Re: JUnit 5, Lambas and Fundamentals</header>
    <body>Hi All, I've been holding my peace, since I figure you all don't particularly want a long dissertation about another test framework, running in a different language. However, Matthew's question seems to call for a clear answer so you can figure out which way you want to go. In NUnit, I can mark a test as slow by annotating it [Category("Slow")]. NUnit has no idea what "Slow" means or what to do with it. It's just a tag. In order to make use of the category I have to either specify it using a command-line option or select it in the Categories window of the NUnit Gui. In either case, I can choose to run all tests or just some categories. I can also choose to exclude some categories. There's actually more flexibility at the command line than in the Gui, since I can specify boolean combinations of categories there like "Data-Slow", which means run all the Data category except those also marked as Slow. Here are differences in the implementations, as I have observed them. It may not be complete and could even be dead wrong in the case of JUnit, so please correct me if I'm off base: 1. NUnit categories are strings. JUnit's are classes. 2. NUnit controls what categories to execute at runtime, without changing the code. JUnit requires changing the code or at least setting up suites for each of your commonly used categories in advance. I suppose some IDEs may allow runtime selection of categories for JUnit. These two differences appear to be orthogonal. Regarding the first difference: I once spent some time considering emulating JUnit and using a Type rather than a string to represent a category. Use of a Type (class) is more sophisticated and appealed to me at first. In the end, I couldn't really point to an solid advantage to the user, so we still use strings. Regarding the second difference: Runtime category selection is something NUnit users wouldn't want to do without these days. There seems to be no obstacle to allowing it in JUnit while retaining the ability to define suites as now. That's what I would do... Charlie</body>

  <mail>
    <header>Re: JUnit 5, Lambas and Fundamentals</header>
    <body>Thank you for your dissertation, it is always useful to have another point of view, especially if it's based upon experience with another test framework. To recap: In NUnit, you can annotate a method/class with a category, and when you run the tests, you can filter the tests run based upon a category, through the GUI or command line options. Let's have a JUnit example: Using the above code (no suites, nothing else apart from the category classes), when I run my tests in maven surefire, I can specify the categories for which I want to run tests, and it performs as expected. This only runs testFast(). You can't specify a category in Eclipse, but mostly because it hasn't yet been added :-). I personally would find this useful. This is a reasonably easy change, but may take a while to add because of the release cycle for Eclipse. Also, it is fairly easy to put an extra command line parameter to JUnitCore to only run particular categories, similarly to the maven plugin. If this is wanted, please raise an issue/pull request. As an aside, I can't remember the last time I ran a set of tests from the command line directly (except for answering stack overflow questions). I use Eclipse, maven and rarely ant, but never the command line. To explain, I always want my tests to be run as part of a build, and I always build just before I commit, so I don't want the mental overhead of having to run JUnit from the command line each time. A bit of explanation. Apologies if this is obvious. We're talking about multiple things here. JUnit, maven surefire and the Eclipse JUnit plugin. JUnit, given a list of classes/tests, will execute the tests. Maven surefire &amp;amp; the eclipse plugin selects the list of classes/tests to test. JUnit supports categories, as does maven surefire, but the Eclipse plugin does not, nor does the command line. So, ignoring the class/string debate, would the following be acceptable for you: 1) Add a command line parameter to specify categories to include/ignore (JUnitCore) 2) Change the Eclipse (or IDE of choice) to specify categories to include/ignore Also, there are moves afoot to add test discovery directly to JUnit, through ClasspathSuite or similar, so the command line option may be easier to use.

    <body>Like I mentioned in my e-mail before, the runner I wrote has support for annotation-based categories (with a meta-annotation @TestGroup so that you can add your own group annotations to your will). I see several practical benefits of not using strings and enforcing annotations: - harder to make a typo (compiler checks/ validation), - easier to lookup a bunch of annotated tests using IDE's standard tools (lookup any occurrence of annotation @Slow, etc.), - easier to convey the defaults for an annotation (since the meta-annotation holds the default system property for turning it on and off, the description of an annotation etc.). Categories can also be implemented with test/class rules, they don't really need a designated runner. A disabled test would be assumption-ignored by the rule. Dawid</body>

    <header>Re: JUnit 5, Lambas and Fundamentals</header>
    <body>Charlie, Thanks very much for your input.  With regards to the last two points, which I think are definitely interesting: 1) The main thing we were hoping to get with classes was help from the compiler, based on a real-life experience (in a different context) in which someone checked in a test that should have been in the "must pass" group, but mispeled the label name, causing a bug to slip through.  There was also the thought that IDE's could help with renames and reference counts.  I'll leave it to more frequent users of the feature to say whether those have been worth it. I'd also take quite seriously any recommendations for how we could enable string-based category names without breaking existing users. 2) It's been quite a while since I've thought of JUnitCore.main as the primary "runtime" of JUnit.  It's been many, many years since I worked on a team where invoking that directly was done with any frequency whatsoever. The vast majority of tests are run either through IDEs or build systems, which, as far as I've seen, always bypass the command-line processing functionality of JUnitCore in order to implement their own graphical or XML-based configuration system.  So adding command-line options to JUnitCore has become rather low-priority in my book, since it would help such a small percentage of users. That's an explanation of the current status quo, which needs not necessarily be maintained. I hope that users and maintainers of other frameworks feel welcome to post their experiences with these other frameworks here.</body>

    <body>For the first two, you would achieve the same if you just declare your category names as String constants and reference those, while giving the option to write typos if you prefer. I don't quite understand the third bullet so I don't know about that. Now, if I have to write fully qualified class names as command line parameters, I would actually prefer to just write "slow".

  <mail>
    <header>Re: JUnit 5, Lambas and Fundamentals</header>
    <body>The third bullet is related to the first two. The @Slow annotation is declared as: the @TestGroup indicates @Slow is a category, it is enabled by default and it can be turned on or off with a -Dslow=[on,off,true,false,yes,no] system property, regardless of how this property is passed to the runner (IDE, command line, etc.). I'm not saying it's the only solution to the problem, it's just a different type of choice compared to string-based categories and it's been working really well for me so I throw my 5c to the discussion. The downside of using annotations is that they need to be accessible to the compiler which may be an additional hassle in multi-project settings (a common test dependency with category annotations). There are always pros and cons. Dawid</body>

    <body>Yes, exactly. You can see a real-life example of such test groups in Apache Lucene, here:  org/apache/lucene/util/LuceneTestCase.java#L151-L205 Oh, and I forgot -- there is one more thing you can do with this: because test categories are _your_ annotations you can add custom fields to them, as in: @TestGroup(enabled = false, sysProperty = SYSPROP_AWAITSFIX) Whenever you mark a test as awaiting a fix you'll also have to provide a bug URL to the associated issue. Nice little benefits :) Disabled categories produce assumption-ignored events, as in:  For example: [junit4:junit4] IGNOR/A 0.01s J1 | TestIndexWriterDelete.testApplyDeletesOnFlush [junit4:junit4]    &amp;gt; Assumption #1: 'nightly' test group is disabled (@Nightly) You could argue whether this is the desired behavior (an ignored test could be silently dropped too). The feedback from Lucene/Solr developers was that they preferred this to be explicit so that ignored tests were reported, not dropped. Again -- a matter of the developer group's consensus rather than any "optimal" choice. Dawid</body>

    <body>Or just a separate "name" attribute I don't quite see how this would work.  Take Eclipse as an example: it chooses which test classes it wants to run with no help from the org.junit source code (by looking at its own internal model of the classpath), and then eventually asks JUnit to run them.

    <header>Re: JUnit 5, Lambas and Fundamentals</header>
    <body>OK, so I guess it would be up to the IDE developers to support the category selection in the GUI. Something that would help me is if there was a way to define a suite by package name. So I could say @Suite(package="foo") and the suite would then consist of all tests in package "foo" and its "subpackages" (such as foo.bar). Is this possible somehow? I generally just like to group my tests by packages but the current syntax seems to require me to manually keep a list of classes for each suite. If I add or remove any test classes, I would need to update the suite. IntelliJ allows me to right-click on a package and run all tests in it like this. But then it just runs all my tests and I don't have control over categories etc. With a package level suite definition I could configure it in a separate class as I like and not worry about updating it for new tests etc. Also, junit.org has been showing a 404 page for a few days at least. Is that by intent? Was looking for some documentation on this. Teemu</body>

    <header>Re: Categories and JUnit</header>
    <body>All, on the one hand, I agree with what Paul said: Keep the core small and proper. On the other hand, the discussion in this thread and in "JUnit 5, Lambas and Fundamentals" started by Mark Levison has made it very clear that using Categories is not as easy as it should be. It (often) requires maintaining classic Suites by hand which is very cumbersome. Forgetting to add a new test to the SuiteClasses annotation is a common pitfall. Thus, I think finding test classes on the classpath and filtering them by category or name is something that does belong to the core. junit.contrib is a nice idea but so far there is no clear release model, no common licence and so on. JUnit core on the other hand, is a commonly used library. New features and improvements become immediately usable by a large majority of Java developers. If we decide to add such functionality to JUnit, I think we have the following possibilities: 1. Include Johannes' ClasspathSuite pretty much as-is. 2. Include Dale's RuntimeSuite pretty much as-is. 3. Include both runners but delegate to a common implementation behind the scenes. Personally, I very much like Dale's approach. It is very flexible, one can easily add a custom Finder or Filter without touching the runner. Option (3) would have the advantage that existing users of ClasspathSuite would have an easy migration (changing package names). All of these possibilities require that Johannes and/or Dale relicense their codebases under CPL for us, I guess. @Johannes, Dale: Would you do that? @All: What do you think?

    <body>@Marc - thanks that was exactly the point I was trying to make. This is a core problem, some of the basic functionality of Junit is hard to use. Before tackling new features let's make the basics simple. @David - you're correct most developers are using eclipse, maven and ant. Many of these bypass Junit mechanisms for finding and running tests. Why? Any chance it's because Junit doesn't yet do what they need? Perhaps with a more flexible Junit core the could reduce the amount of code they need to support Junit. That might make it easier to decouple the Junit innovation cycle from the other tools. @Charlie thanks for the clear explanation of what NUnit does. Thanks for all the other replies.

    <header>Re: junit in three IDEs</header>
    <body>David, Yes - it something I regularly find possible with other languages and environments: The experience goes something like this: I want to unit test one class - so that means one file.  If I MUST pull in many other classes I am not really testing one class, therefore not really unit testing. I get a copy of this file then compile it, the compiler gives errors about missing dependencies - I create these as dummies - much like test first development - just enough of a file or class to make the error go away.  Next I add methods as needed by the code, then dummy up some return values if needed by the unit-under-test.  I figure in java I might use something like mockito to make this faster and easier. When I am done I have something that will compile, but no way to test it. I now write skeleton code to test methods of the unit-under-test.  I figure junit fits in here. The "extra" file (or files) that I have made are part of my "test fixture" - one time setup needed to plug in and test the unit-under-test.  I can now test the unit-under-test independently of other units which will get their own tests, and I don't need to pull in the world to do it.  It also gives me a clearer idea of the behavior of the unit-under-test (file, class, etc). Hopefully that makes my use case clearer. Fenn (Brian Fennell)</body>

    <body>Esko, Yes, theses linkages can be at the preprocessor time or at link time (for C).  For Perl they can be at run-time (since Perl gets compiled into bytecode at runtime) or at "compile time" (for the case of modules that are pre-compiled to bytecode, then seralized as bytecode to disk for later loading, but this is rare).  For Java dependency checking can be at compile-time or at runtime.  For Java runtime dependency checking an happen automatically, or when there is an explicit call to ClassLoader.loadClass(String). I am not able to access youtube from work because of our firewall, so I may be missing some of what you are trying to convey. The specific case I am trying to understand is unit tests for code where I have the source, so I am more interested in the compile time use case.  If I am working with existing code, and I don't want to make changes to the code just to test, I am not sure how polymorphism helps me - either I use the class that my class-under-test depends on from my existing code base, or I don't.  If I don't, I can create a class in my project with the same name and packagename, or I can subclass that class, but using a subclass is a code change, and I only want to test the existing code, not change it just to test it.  I can pass subclasses of needed classes as arguments to the methods of my class-under-test, but again to sub-class I either need to pull in the existing class or I don't, and if I am to unit test just one class - well I don't want to pull in anything I can avoid pulling in. Perhaps you are suggesting that I refactor for testability - which is an option, but not the usecase I am trying to understand. javac will throw an error if I have an import statement and the class to import is not there at compiletime. java will throw an exception at runtime if I have a class that compiled fine because the class was there at compile-time, but it is not in the classpath now.  In either case I can provide the original class or a class that simply has the same name and the same interface. I don't have to provide the entire interface, only the bits that are used by my class-under-test. My usecase can easily expand to 2 classes-under-test or 3 or 5 or 7, but I wanted to understand the 1-class usecase first.  I don't want to have to pull in then entire 50000 class project just to test one class. The following pages (see below) describe part of what I am talking about with subversion and eclipse, but I was hoping to get a compare and contrast of different IDEs, and how junit fits in specifically.

Sure, you could use functional programming to write more powerful assertions, but that could be done in an assertion framework. The places I see where functional programming could help are Theories and parametrised tests. I think we could do that in JUnit4 with at most a new core Runner.

    <header>Re: Re: Is it Time for JUnit 5</header>
    <body>On one thing, I'm of the same opinion as Kevin: most of what we'd want to do in response to JUnit 8 could happen in a custom Runner, and I think that should be the primary focus of any early Java-8 driven exploration. I do think that a lambda-driven style has some interesting advantages. JUnit &amp;lt;= 4 uses Java as a substrate for its own weird domain-specific language.  Spend enough time with it, and it doesn't feel completely foreign, but it's not really Java.  The main driver for this is that a test is a named block, and reflectively-retrieved methods have, until now, been by far the cheapest syntactic way to create a named block. With lambdas, you can now enable an even cheaper named-block syntax: Now, rather than having to enable all kinds of weird annotation-driven extension schemes, extensions can be built in the natural Java way, through function composition and inheritance.  Create a paramTest function, and you've got parameterized tests: Push further, and the line between assertions and tests begins to look a little fuzzy.  I'm not sure what lies beyond that particular quantum limit, though.  :-) FYI, note that QUnit is a JavaScript test framework that does take this approach ( In general, the first few test frameworks that get released for a language often include at least one whose chief advantage is its familiarity for XUnit users*; later, many users often settle into a framework that fits the grain of the language better.  Since I've never been able to figure out what the grain of JavaScript is, I can't say which frameworks are in which camp. *  (the most extreme example being .NET: NUnit's first release was a method-name-for-method-name clone of JUnit (3.7?), down to methods designed to detect if the test was running on the quirky VisualAge VM, which had no .NET equivalent)</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Is it Time for JUnit 5</header>
    <body>Hi All, One benefit of tests-as-lamdas, that is also enjoyed by Teemu's @Test("Here is my test name") annotation, is being able to express a test name as a string instead of an identifier, as is required when the test name is taken from a method name. Although in Scala there's a way to write a test method with spaces and other non-identifier characters in it, in Java a method name will likely have to be camel case (void hereIsMyTestName() ... ) or use underscores (void here_is_my_test_name() ...). I think the lower friction of being able to write test names as strings encourages, or at least makes less finger work, to write descriptive test names. I think that's a good thing. Another potential benefit is that you can dynamically register tests at runtime. It's useful, but my observation with ScalaTest is that it's been used pretty rarely in practice. Most times people just write tests by hand, and that works just fine when tests are methods. But it is handy when you need it. One downside of tests-as-lamdas compared to tests-as-methods in the Scala world is that test method compile faster than test lamdas, because there's a slight compiler overhead for dealing with lamdas. I have no idea whether this would be the case with the Java 8 compiler, but it may be worth measuring when the time comes. Bill -- Bill Venners Artima, Inc.</body>

    <body>Marc, Thanks for remembering more of the history than I did. If I remember correctly (and obviously my memory is suspect, here), it wasn't that SuiteBuilder was a competitor to ClasspathSuite, it was just a different style of building suites, which we'd hoped to release and base something like ClasspathSuite on top of.  The main difference was allowing for an object to be the source of behavior modification, rather than increasingly complex annotation-based schemes (similar to the move from @Before/@After to Rules). I think that we simply ran out of energy or time before getting the code shippable. Certainly, we'd want to make sure that Johannes was comfortable re-licensing his code to us. If you have time and energy to make this a reality, I think it would definitely be interesting. One question would be whether this would be something we'd want in JUnit core, or perhaps try to re-vitalize an extension project like junit.contrib (which might be easier now that more people could get the new functionality just by repointing their maven dependency?), or just a family of small extensions.  148058da827d3897672be2959c132dcbd/doc/ReleaseNotes4.9.html</body>

    <body>Esko, Thanks for your thoughts, and your work in this arena.  I haven't had a chance to take a deep look at your work, but look forward to doing so. The motive for creating a new breaking version would be several-fold: - Primarily, it's always been my opinion that a unit-testing framework should "fit the grain" of the host language.  It is looking like the transition from Java 7 to 8 will be an even bigger shift in the grain of Java than between 4 and 5.  There's been a lot of things we've wanted to do all along with JUnit that I've designed first in my head the way they would have worked in a language with lambdas, and then redesigned to fit the grain of a lambda-less language.  Assertions (and mocks) have especially contorted themselves in ways that they might finally now be able to relax. - Secondarily, personally, there are some core decisions made very early in the design of JUnit 4 that are beginning to show their age, and are hard to figure out how to fix while leaving everything intact: node, and a mutable builder for the test structure, and then later an immutable reference for the test structure, is exasperating. causes some awkwardness. before any is run places some binding constraints, and should be at most optional in a world in which tests are often run by daemons many more times a day than by humans. are developers.  Passed/Failed?  Passed/Failed/Skipped? Passed/Failed/Ignored, etc.  The current design bakes one required system pretty deep into the internals, unnecessarily. Now, should the framework to which I'd contribute time to fix these problems be called JUnit 5, or something entirely different?  That's another kettle of fish, with some interesting options to consider.  Looks like we have at least 9 months to consider them at length.  ecsy/java/JavaSpecsyExample.java  specsy/groovy/GroovySpecsyExample.groovy</body>

    <body>David Saff wrote on 13.12.2012 17:47: Yes, assertions could probably get much benefit from lambdas. I support the idea of having assertions as a separate library which is decoupled from the testing framework (the same way as Hamcrest, FEST-Assert and probably others). The testing framework would then focus fully on the test execution model (e.g. test isolation, execution order, rules and other metaprogramming). There is wide variablity in how assertions can be done (especially in different languages). I don't have strong opinions about what an assert should be like, and seems that there are as many kinds of asserts as there are testing frameworks. There is less variablity in testing frameworks' execution model, but those differences are often at a more fundamental level (e.g. test isolation vs. shared state). I and others hold strong opinions about them. Thus I would like to be able to mix and match the frameworks and assertions separately, sometimes even using multiple assertion libraries in the same test. I've noticed those as well. I've already addressed each of those in Jumi: - A testing framework must assign a unique immutable TestId for each test in a test class, which is then used to send events of when the test was started, finished, failed etc. The TestId implies a tree structure of tests (to be used in test result reports). Everything is expressed as immutable events (Jumi relies heavily on Event Sourcing). See details at  - The fi.jumi.api.drivers.Driver which corresponds org.junit.runner.Runner requires a zero-argument constructor. The test class et al is passed as method argument to  - Jumi starts executing tests as soon as possible, at both the suite and test class levels. At suite level, test class execution starts asynchronously before all test classes are discovered (i.e. before Jumi has finished traversing the directories containing test classes). At test class level, more tests can be found during test execution (for example Specsy requires this) and the new test executions can be started asynchronously in parallel (depending on the testing framework and whether the user has disabled parallelism for that test class or the whole suite). That's been on my mind for a long time, but I haven't yet figured out a good way to support all the variations, so I'm deferring the decision. I would love to hear your ideas. A very flexible way would be to allow tagging tests with arbitrary keywords, but then the problem will be that how each of those keywords should affect the user interface. There would have to be at least some keywords with specific meaning, which brings us back to the original question of which states to support. To get started we could list all the variations in use today and the use cases for using each of them (e.g. it's an acceptance tests for a feature which has not yet been implemented). I'm hoping there to be 5 or less different reasons that are served by test statuses. 9 months, like giving birth to a baby. I suppose the names of quite many people have been pondered for that long. :) JUnit's name is well known, so it's a marketing bonus. On the other hand, the software industry moves quickly and good technology can get popular regardless of its name. -- Esko Luontola www.orfjackal.net</body>

So I think that when considering a new version, we could certainly consider strongly following the design examples of other frameworks, like Jumi or others, but in the end, a JUnit 5 would be built piece by piece by submissions to this community. I think also that the compatibility between JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 was instrumental in making it useful for teams, and I'd like to see a similar focus on backward compatibility moving forward. One last thought: one of the biggest confusions about JUnit 4 was the fact that it was both a version number referring to a new release of a software package, _and_ the only useful name for the collection of new libraries included in that release.  Starting in JUnit 5, I think a different naming scheme would be quite helpful.  Choosing a scheme that I'm positive we _won't_ use, for example: - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit &amp;lt;= 3 would be JUnit Cupcake - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 4 would be JUnit Donut - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 5 would be JUnit Eclair Thanks, On Mon, Dec 17, 2012 at 6:42 AM, Neale Upstone</body>

    <header>Categories and JUnit</header>
    <body>In the land of NUnit when I find a client has written some veryyyyyyyy slow runnnnnning tests I encourage them to use categories to label the slow stuff and then we just run them separately. That works well enough to allow clients to start digging themselves out of the hole called Database/FileAccess in a unit test. This is doable because NUnit allows to specify /include and /exclude from the command line. So you just feed it the assembly name and /exclude and it runs your tests without the slow stuff. Now back in the land of JUnit 4.10 (included in Eclipse), I just assumed that something similar would hold true. But I'm confused, I can live without the handy command line options although they do make life much simpler. How do I make Categories work I tried writing this code: @RunWith(Categories.class) @IncludeCategory(SlowTests.class) But that fails with an initialization error - claiming I'm missing a constructor (who knew). So then I tried: @RunWith(Categories.class) @ExcludeCategory(SlowTests.class) And while it works we see to back in the world of JUnit 3.8.1 - where everything had to be declared in suites and we often forget to add test classes. Help me see that I'm missing an easier, more obvious and better way. It **almost** seems better just to move the slower tests to their own separate tree (yes that has its own problems).

    <header>Re: Is it Time for JUnit 5</header>
    <body>Hi David, JUnit for me is still the de facto standard for unit testing in Java. It's integrated in all the major IDEs from the start. It's known by pretty much every Java Developer. Even if they don't use it or don't use it well, it's still the first unit testing framework that comes to mind. This has probably to do with the trust in the people who guide and develop JUnit. But I really don't know Moving towards JUnit 5 I think it will be hard to to loose this status, I think. When it makes sense to use an existing library (and licences allow), I see no principal problem in reusing something like Jumi for JUnit 5. I have no idea, whether that makes sense at all, since I didn't look into Jumi. I just don't think that JUnit 5 should necessarily be "built piece by piece by submissions to this community". Using Hamcrest inside JUnit 4 was a great move and it is an external library. I also think, that backwards compatibility for executing JUnit 4 Tests at least is a must. If I can't gracefully migrate towards JUnit 5 I would have a problem and many other as well. I'm not sure whether we still need JUnit 3 support, though. JUnit 4 is old enough, that I think we could kill JUnit 3 if that makes things easier. I think JUnit 4 was a great naming. I made clear, that the new software release also brough the new libraries. I don't see that as a problem. And doing the same with JUnit 5 would be consistent with that. So when JUnit 5 changes the interface for tests and also brings a new release (of course) I would still call it JUnit 5 and everyone should know what's meant. I think it would be much more confusing If you started to introduce two names. One for the software release version and one for the interface. Then I would have to say something like: I use JUnit 5 but I'm writing JUnit Donut style tests? And who can remember those strange names anyways? Do you remember the last two names of Eclipse and can sort them? Or any other product that uses naming for that matter? I can't. But I can easily remember JUnit 3, 4 and 5. And I have no problem in stating that I use JUnit 5 with JUnit 4 style tests. On the other hand I strongly believe that, whatever you do, it will work out ok for two reasons: 1) JUnit is just too established and too well known. 2) I trust in Kent and you, to stear JUnit in a good direction and to listen to the community.

    <body>[Hmm... I was expecting Cupcakes, Donuts and Eclairs for lunch on Thurs when I visit Google (London) for lunch tomorrow :)] One possible change from 4 including the libraries would be to pull out a junit-core, which would define the runners and interfaces. Perhaps there would also be a junit4-compat or something which would allow breaking changes to be adapted to run via existing JUnit4 interfaces, or the other way around, for JUnit4 to be able to run seamlessly from new APIs via adapters.

    <body>Mark, I think what you want is a still-missing-feature, rather than a regression "back [to] the world of JUnit 3.8.1".  With or without categories, JUnit doesn't have a built-in way to run everything on the classpath, or in some particular jar.  Generally, this is supplied by the framework using JUnit, be it maven, ant, Eclipse, etc. There's a couple of paths to the future you're probably hoping for.

That way you could apply any filter etc you wanted. Added bonus do it on a lazy eval basis and parameterized attributes work well (ala NUnit again). Martin the Classpath runner you linked to is exactly what I'm looking for. Maybe in another life this could just be integrated in JUnit.

    <body>Mirko Friedenhagen wrote on 19.12.2012 16:32: I'm talking about JUnit backward compatibility - that you can run JUnit tests using Jumi. Surefire is on the other side of the toolchain. Maven integration is very important for Jumi's adoption, you don't need to worry about that. It remains to be seen whether it will be easier to modify Surefire or to build a new plugin. I've looked at Surefire's support for test runners (JUnit, TestNG, POJO) and they are not ideal for Jumi, because Jumi's scope includes half of what Surefire does. Jumi's scope includes taking care of test discovery and creating the JVM process. That overlaps with Surefire's responsibilities (as well as every other build tool, CI and IDE). One reason for taking over those responsibilities is to make the tests run the same way regardless of whether they are run from within and IDE or a build tool. Currently there are slight differences in classpaths, working directories etc. when running the same tests from different tools. Another reason is to enable better usability on the IDE side. Supporting the same reporting format as Surefire uses is also important, because many CIs already know how to parse that format. In the long run, to expose all the information that Jumi provides, a new reporting format may be created. (Jumi anyways persists an event log of test executions, so other tools could use Jumi's libraries to read that same file format.) -- Esko Luontola www.orfjackal.net</body>

    <body>Really, you have to adjust. Being a Java Developer is all about tool-support. Your approach simply makes no sense. Even SSD space is cheap, Ram is cheap, connections are fast. Checkout/pull junit with IntelliJ. It will ask you to open the project. If you have configured a SDK other than 5 got to project settings (ctrl+alt+shift+s) and choose the one that you favour. The project will be up and running. Checking out and configuring takes me around 1 minute. IntelliJ is the most keyboard-centric IDE i know. If you want to know a shortcut simply use ctrl+shift+a to search for the command and see the shortcut. You will not immediately know about all benefits but as soon as you have learned to use the IDE properly and learned about real Java development you will laugh at the idea of coding using vi. Wanting to develop effectively and staying with vi/working on just a few files simply does not mix. Developing Java (or any other advanced OO language) means a lot of refactoring all the time. You will switch approaches constantly. Create/delete classes, move methods, rename methods/parameters, change configuration, ... Without proper tool support this is hard work. Also you will never get the style a project is coded in and its design without looking at the whole. For instance the code ive seen in junit so far is not the typical code style of a java project. I think a lot of code comes from people with a C background. If I would add a class the way I usually write it it would simply not fit in. I cannot go into more detail but it would be a good idea to just drop the bearded-unwashed-linux-freak-attitude and give it a try. If you really are open to something new I promise that you will not regret it. But dont take it lightly. It will take a few years to adjust and learn how to effectively use the tools.

Ideally I'd like to create a "test run" in the data store that contains a unique identifier and the data for a particular test and then execute it by providing the unique identifier to JUnit. JUnit would then pass this along to the correct test classes. I apologize for the overly vague description, but what would be the most efficient use of JUnit for this use case? It would seem the solution would be two fold. First, I'd create Parameterized tests that read the test data from the data store based on provided unique identifiers.

    <header>Re: Custom MethodSorter</header>
    <body>First, my bad for putting the question up multiple places. I'll use the mailing list for discussions, then respond at Stack Overflow. Now, in you response you write "This isn't easy, and is discouraged, because JUnit doesn't encourage dependent tests." I'm not quite sure what that means :-). Is is possible, or not? Looking at the source code, it might just look impossible, but maybe someone knows something I don't? "Cannot be done" or "Yes. It's discouraged, you do it by..."? And of course, from there on it gets messy :-) I know that JUnit doesn't encourage dependent test, and if our IDE of choice had better support for Testng (who doesn't have this particular sentiment), we'd just go down that route. But it doesn't, and now JUnit does support ordering, so we're trying to adapt to that. With JUnit 4.11, we've got a way. If we find a way to create our own MethodSorter (which I hope for), we're good. If JUnit should provide its own mechanism (which I might dream of, but not hope for), it would be even better. Until then, method names are it, and now we've got methods named "test01_insert" and "test02_copy". It's not ideal, and I'm a bit sad that the test framework insists so hard to not support us in our usage pattern, but I think that ship has sailed. Eirik  or-junits-fixmethodorder I'm looking at creating my own MethodSorter. Is there documentation on how&amp;gt; &amp;gt; to do that, and is it even possible?</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Custom MethodSorter</header>
    <body>It is possible, but you might need to write your own Runner. I had a pull request a while back that allowed you to designate groups of methods that must "happen before" other methods but would not dictate the sequence within that graph, but then we lost interest it pursuing that line of testing. JUnit sees itself as purely for Unit tests. Unit tests by their very nature are supposed to be fast, so if your test requires setup from a previous test... just invoke the previous test as your first step in your "dependent" test, so you'll have something like It doesn't matter what order the above tests are run, and dependencies are clearly called out. OK, so the something() method gets invoked 3 times, but these are Unit tests, so it doesn't matter, and you have clean setup of the fresh Foo instance created for each run. Also, by the way, true JUnit style is *one* assert per test method... ok nobody does that all the time... though when I have done it it has proved really useful. TestNG cares about more than just Unit tests... when you hit more heavyweight tests, then you need to care about test sequencing as you really want to try and keep the number of asserts per method down so that you get a fine grained view of test failures. What I have wanted to see in JUnit is a way to mark smoke tests for features. If the smoke test fails then all the tests that cover that feature would be skipped. The danger of such support is that it would be tempting to abuse for sequencing tests ;-) -Stephen</body>

    <header>Re: Custom MethodSorter</header>
    <body>Sorry to skip back to the top question. As many people point out, if you're doing this because test B only operates as expected if test A runs first, don't do that.  There are lots of ways to avoid that, and I'm happy to talk about it. On the other hand, if the reason you're doing this is to order independent tests in a way that puts fast or often-failing tests near the beginning of a run in order to enhance feedback time, I totally understand what you're going for, so let's pretend that's why you want to do it. Don't use MethodSorter.  It's at a lower implementation level than you likely want. Instead, write a custom runner: Now, you just have to define createDelegate(...) and createSorter(...). For a fully general solution, you could make new annotations, to enable: @RunWith(Sorted.class) @SortedRunWith(JUnit4.class) If you (or anyone listening) wanted to take a go at making a pull request to add something like that to the core, I think it would be useful. However, to just get your job done, you might go ahead and hard-code the particular Runner and Sorter that you want. Good luck,</body>

    <header>Re: Custom MethodSorter</header>
    <body>If you want to change the test method run order because you want that method order to change every run/hour/day, then a custom Runner is not a great option; your teammates will have to remember to use that custom runner everywhere. Instead, you can create your own main class to replace JUnitCore and use Request.sortWith() and use something like this to order it:  /Ordering.html#arbitrary Be aware that if the method order changes during the day that could be problematic. If I am doing development and a test starts to fail, my first thought is I made a code change that caused it to fail, and go and look for the bug I introduced in my code or test. It wouldn't at all occur to me that the test started failing because the clock passed 2pm, so the method order was changed because it was an even hour. If you want your method order to periodically change, have it change at 2am and have a continuous build. -- Kevin</body>

    <body>It looks like Closure will finally find their way into Java. With this feature many nice ways to do thing become possible. Therefore I am wondering if other people agree that it might be time for a JUnit5 putting this new feature to good use. A source for inspiration for me in this regard are the FunSuite of ScalaTest  There a test definition is a method call (instead of a method definition in JUnit) that registers a test for execution. It looks roughly like this: With this approach things like Rules become extremly trivial, since all you have to do is wrap the code block (i.e. closure) in a new new code block. Also parameterized test become fairly easy, because you would just put the call to test in a loop. What do you think? Is this an interesting direction for JUnit to go? kind regards Jens</body>

    <body>I've had a bit more time to flesh out my design and I'm running into a bit of a problem. As I mentioned previously I'm using Selenium in conjunction with JUnit to do automated browser testing. Suppose I have a test class that Id like to execute with parameters that are read from an external data source such as a database. The tests in this class have a common setup and tear down that is currently implemented as a @ClassRule. This setup reads required information from a database. Please note that this setup is relatively expensive in terms of execution time and resources. Now suppose Id like to execute this same test class multiple times with different sets of parameters to model different business situations. One of the supported ways to do this is through the parameterized runner and the @Parameters annotation. The problem Im now experiencing is with regards to the setup and tear down  The behavior of @ClassRule (and @BeforeClass / @AfterClass), as expected, only executes once before all parameterized instances and once after all parameterized instances. Outside of moving the expensive setup and tear down to the individual method level using @Before / @After / @Rule  or implementing a custom runner are there any other solutions to this problem? There does look like there is an existing open issue on GitHub requesting this functionality: Thanks for your time, Corey</body>

Though it works on Java 7, the syntax is awfully verbose [1], but with Java 8's lambdas it will be quite close to the Groovy version [2]. The motivation for creating Specsy was to have test isolation (like JUnit and JDave), nested tests (like JDave and Scala's specs), and instead of "after methods" it has more expressive defer blocks (like Golang). [1]  ecsy/java/JavaSpecsyExample.java [2]  specsy/groovy/GroovySpecsyExample.groovy Right now I'm implementing a new test runner called Jumi ( runner, as explained in During this winter holiday I should be able to add support for test discovery, maybe also JUnit backward compatibility, after which it should be usable for early adopters (right now it's usable only for testing framework developers - Specsy 2.0 runs on Jumi). What does this have to do with JUnit 5? - Firstly, both of these frameworks I mentioned had clear goals to do some things that were lacking in JUnit and other frameworks. What are the goals for JUnit 5? What would be such a radical improvement that it would warrant a major release (that breaks compatibility, basically being a new testing framework) instead of minor 4.x releases? - Secondly, if you decide to create a "JUnit 5" that is a radical change from JUnit 4, instead of an incremental update, then please keep an eye on Jumi. If JUnit 4's test runner is not enough for JUnit 5, then it could run using Jumi instead of creating yet another test runner.

    <body>Hello, while I do not agree with Stephen on adding no methods for testing (e.g. I like my objects to have final members only and add default scoped constructor for easier testing sometimes), I find it extremely hard to have easily understandable equals or hashcode methods. IMO these are mostly useful in pure data objects only, any class with a state should not implement these and should fall back to the default object identity comparison.

    <header>Re: assertArrayEquals on arrays of objects</header>
    <body>Not when you are dealing with the CONTRACT of the class. The person object has a contract, namely that there be a first and last name [*] Now lets look at a different case. The Task object. Because Task objects are submitted to queues and sets and lists, it needs a specific semantics for equals and hashCode. Namely identity. But two Tasks can be the same even if they are not equal. It is legitimate for me to submit to a work queue two "equal" tasks but which have different identity. Therefore when testing the TaskCloner class, it is reasonable to verify that when passed an array of tasks it returns "equal" tasks in the same order. Such a test cannot be done based on Task.equals() *because* the Task object *requires* equals to be based on identity, so we *must* use Duck comparison to compare the two arrays. [*]: I dislike the Person analogy because "Bono" and "Cher" cause issues! I am not saying that you use Duck comparison for every case. It does not make sense for the Person object. There is maybe 1% (at best) when you *should* use duck comparison... the Task case being a reasonable example IMHO. The O.P. asked *why* one would want to not use the .equals() method and *how* you would proceed in that case, I responded to answer the *why* and *how* and you seem to have jumped on me thinking I am recommending this for *all* tests... I am not and have not. Duck-comparison is a valid and useful tool to keep in your toolbelt. And its use should be critically evaluated just as I recommend critically evaluating adding any method to your production code *just to make testing easier*. That is because I have found that when you look closer it is never "just to make testing easier" and it is almost always "I don't know what I am doing". But if you always know exactly what you are doing then I bow to your splendid magnificence and concede that you are a better programmer than I. -Stephen</body>

Now personally for a Person object I would have an equals implemented that compared based on names, *because* it is, to my mind, an essential component of such a class. BUT by Duck-Comparison I mean you look at the public exposed API contract of the object and compare based on that. I am saying don't add either *for the test*.

    <body>I partially disagree with this statement. Yes, adding more code adds more scope for introducing bugs, but if you're adding code that allows your code to be tested, then that is a good thing. When I'm dealing with dates and times in code, then it's a very common idiom to see a DateTimeHelper which an be injected so that you can test code which depends on the current date and time. Without this, it's very hard to test this sort of code. So adding code can make my code more reliable. Within reason, of course. I would say that if your equals/hashCode aren't necessary except for tests, then don't put them in. You can always override/mock them in your tests if you really really need them. However, I would feel that having equals and hashCode *only* in the tests is probably a code smell. I can't think of an example where this would be necessary.

Thank goodness we had Jenkins running nightly tests, and nobody had committed *any* changes to that branch that week... or we would never have found the bug. Adding code to "make testing easier" can have unintended consequences when others come along maintaining your code and start to abuse your API contract! [Yes it was somebody doing something they shouldn't have... and yes I suspect they would have used reflection to achieve the same bug if the helper was not there... but that would have been a bigger more glaring code smell] The real issue is that Comparator, Object.equals, Object.hashCode all have an implicit contract defined by the JRE, and you need to ensure that they are correctly implemented *with respect to that contract*. The comparisons that you need to make in unit tests *need not necessarily be the same* as the required contract that your classes are required to follow for their correct behaviour in production. As long as when you are writing your assertThat(x, is(y)) or you stop and think: "Is it really the equality as specified by the x's .equals() method that I want to check" then you are fine.

If you do one, then do the other, so you have to apply the same rigour to your test code as you do to your code under test. 3) Lots of collection classes (such as Map, Set) implicitly rely on hashCode/equals. Overriding these methods can change behaviour, and generally confuse things. If equals() and hashCode() in your test code are implemently correctly, then functionally the code will be correct, but may This will put all of your keys in the same bucket in a HashMap). 4) Objects inserted in a map/set by the code under test won't be found by the test code, because you've overridden equals() and hashCode(). 5) ORMs such as hibernate depend implicitly on hashCode and equals. If they are lazily loaded, then the class itself will be a dynamic proxy, so this.getClass() != o.getClass(), so implementing equals becomes more complicated. For more information, I recommend reading Overriding equals and hashCode in java especially the accepted answer, and the hibernate answer. Convinced yet? So either implement equals() and hashCode() correctly in your real classes, or use custom code to test for equality (such as a Matcher, or simply a custom method). Matthew Farwell.</body>

    <body>Sorry, as the person to start all of this I feel bad for not chiming in, but I've been ill ! Anyway, there's been some interesting reasons for and against this but my reasons boil down to this: 1) If I am TDDing, which is always, and I write a test that will fail because .equals() and hashCode() have not been overriden I will get no meaningful diagnostics in the test because .equals() evaluates to true or false and that is it.  With a matcher I'm going to get told that object don't match with a full list of fields that do and do not match - and surely everyone checks their test diagnostics before making a test pass? 2) I write a test that overrides equals based on all the fields in the object and I make it go green and all is good with the world.  A requirement comes in meaning that I want equals to only match on a single field (Id or something like that), my tests of course still pass.  I then go and make a change to some code so that checking all fields would fail the test, but only using the equals method means it passes.

    <body>Hello. I have a set of test cases that cannot be executed on certain systems (they involve OpenGL, and some features of OpenGL are optional and cannot be determined to be supported until runtime). Is there some way I can have a test signal that it is not supported and should therefore silently pass? test, but this involves quite a lot of manual labour (and also requires me to manually throw exceptions in the case of tests that expect exceptions to be thrown).</body>

    <header>junit in three IDEs</header>
    <body>hi folks, I am a old command-line loving unix geek, but I want to get trendy and learn at least one IDE.  Up until now vi+BASH has been my IDE of choice.  I also already program in about two dozen languages. To try out my sea legs I want to compare and contract Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA against the following use case: I need to grock some java code in an existing SVN repository.  I want to pull down one existing java file, write some junit tests, but not pull down the entire giant project it is attached to.  I may need some moch objects too just to get it to compile, and to make the junit tests work. Most of the how-to and intro stuff I can find on these IDEs starts with "so you make your FIRST project, then pull down some menus, and the wonderful IDE helps you type in your FIRST java program, then if you really want to you can save the entire project in CVS!"  This is hardly EVER the scenario I run into.  It is more likely I need to jump into the middle of thousands or millions of existing files and learn to swim without breaking anything, maybe even fix a bug or add a feature. Can anyone give me some tips on the "best" way to do this with his or her favorite IDE and some selection of plugins? Brian Fennell</body>

    <header>Re: junit in three IDEs</header>
    <body>The requirement to be able to pull down a single file is somewhat new to me.  Although it can consume a fair amount of bandwidth, disk space, and waiting time to pull down the full project for editing, these days I find that the sum of those costs is less than the cost of my time trying to finagle a specialized one-off project configuration to exclude some of the dependencies. Is this something you regularly find possible with vi and bash?</body>

    <body>Dear command line lover. Your request is special. It might match the NetBeans vision of the IDE reproducing to 100% everything that happens on command line. Give it a try. NetBeans have excellent support for Maven, can deal quite well with (even 3rd party created) Ant scripts and there is an experimental support for Gradle. However, this still requires your checkout is buildable from command line. Checking-out a single file and hoping the IDE will think-up the surrounding environment is beyond the scope of what NetBeans (and obviously any other IDE) can do. We are trying to aim at "self describing sources": When you have (you have checked out) sources that a (supported) command line tool can understood, NetBeans understands it as well. -jt Dne Út 27. listopadu 2012 14:11:11, Fenn napsal(a):</body>

    <header>Re: JUnit 4.11-beta-1 is released</header>
    <body>Marc, I agree that Hamcrest is a terrific library for expressing expected test outcomes. So is FEST-Assert. If my tests are small and focused enough, I might even roll with native Java assertions. The AssertionError (or, really, any exception that propagates out of a test) represents sort of an implicit contract between test and runner: signal the test as failed if the exception makes it out of the test unhandled. There are lots of ways to satisfy that contract; I'm not sure that one based on Hamcrest has to be the answer. The time period between JUnit 4.4 and 4.11 was challenging for those developers who wanted some of the goodness of Hamcrest &amp;gt; 1.1, what with the attendant Maven exclusions, surprising failures, and so forth. It led me to wonder whether Assert/Assume ought to be separate from the core of JUnit. Then, the putative "junit-assertions" module could depend on Hamcrest if it so chose, and "junit-core" (made-up module that doesn't exist right now) wouldn't have to. Further, developers could choose to use junit-assertions or not; Hamcrest alone (with MatcherAssert.assertThat()) or not; FEST-Assert, etc. I think of AssumptionViolatedException as another implicit contract between test and runner. Right now, though, unless you want to depend on a public-but-not-published AssumptionViolatedException class that you need Hamcrest to use, org.junit.Assume is the only way to satisfy that contract. Better would be to have AssumptionViolatedException be part of "junit-core", not depending on Hamcrest, and letting Assume live in "junit-assertions" and handle the Hamcrest matching. I'll send more under separate cover, maybe as a GitHub issue, as this doesn't pertain so much to JUnit 4.11 beta 1 as it does a consideration for the next major version of JUnit.

    <header>JUnit Extension to provide comprehensive support for Data Driven Testing</header>
    <body>Hi, There's a new project initiated in the open community that extends JUnit classes to provide Data Driven Testing Support to its users. The project is called EasyTest( (broadly)has the following features: 1) Provide Test Data to your test methods using a simple Annotation(@DataLoader) 2) Test data can be provided in any form : XML, CSV, EXCEL (which are suported by EasyTest) or user can provide its own custom Data Provider implementation. 3) Test methods now support both input parameter as well as output parameter. If a test method is returning output, the output is captured in the same file from which input was provided. 4) The test methods in the IDE now show, for each run of a given test method, what was its input parameters. So if I have a test method with name testMethodwithItemIdParam that takes a single input parameter itemId, then when this test method is executed for different itemId values, the IDE will show something like this : 5) You can generate reports of your test run using a simple @Report annotation 6) You can capture some analytics related information about your class under test using @Intercept annotation. And theres a lot more features. If interested, check out the github project :  For information about the features supported by EasyTest, look at its WIKI:</body>

    <header>junit.org: can you help?</header>
    <body>Summary: can you help patch up the github pages for JUnit to serve as the new home of junit.org? All, You may have recently noticed that days, and then came back a shadow of its former self.  That site has been operated and maintained by 8thlight.com for several years, and by Object Mentor before that.  But it recently had a rather nasty failure, and it's not clear when the content that had been hosted only there will come back. Rather than spend a lot of effort recreating the old situation, I'd like to move us to a new situation, in which the team that develops JUnit is the same one that develops the primary information sources about JUnit.  Along those lines, I'd like to get the github pages for JUnit ready to be a good new home for junit.org.  These pages are hosted at  can be edited by opening pull requests against  visually clean single page, with a short description of what JUnit is, and links to downloads, javadoc, mailing list, and the wiki (  getting better day by day as a source of user documentation. If anyone feels like rolling up their sleeves and give this a try, it would be a great step forward.  I'm out of the office all next week, but am happy to move quickly getting the pieces in place upon my return. Thanks, all,</body>

    <header>assertArrayEquals on arrays of objects</header>
    <body>Hello. Newbie here. I created a class (let's say class A) and in my JUnit class, I created an object (let's say object A1) from class A. Object A1 contains several variables and most importantly, an array of objects which are instantiated from another class (let's say class B); so the elements in that array are objects, not data types like int, string, etc. So I wanted to test this array of objects with another array of objects by simply creating another object; A2 from class A. I wanted to test using assertArrayEquals and the result is red bar. So my question is why did the test fail? I'm thinking probably objects are always different since they are based on reference? But then again assertArrayEquals checks array length and content. Many thanks, halfpirate1210</body>

    <body>Don't add equality or hashCode methods *because* you need them for testing Add them *if* you need them for production. Eg in some cases it makes sense for hashCode to be Object.hashCode(), where you are storing tasks in a hash based map, etc. Each task may well be equivalent to a duplicate, but it may be necessary to repeat the task. Also there is no need to expose more, because duck-based comparison should be sufficient for unit test scenarios... And when it isn't you probably will have implemented an equals method that is either sufficient or can be made so by the addition of duck-comparisons Btw by duck comparisons I mean: If (a.getQuacks()==b.getQuacks()&amp;amp;&amp;amp;a.getWalkingStyle()==b.getWalkingStyle()&amp;amp;&amp;amp;a.isFea\ thered()==b.isFeathered()) Iow compare based on exposed properties -Stephen</body>

    <header>Re: assertArrayEquals on arrays of objects</header>
    <body>What's the justification for this restriction? It makes no sense to me. You might never have to test for equality of your objects in production but need it for testing. And more generally, there is really nothing wrong with implementing hashCode()/equals() for your objects that match their purpose. -- Cédric</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: assertArrayEquals on arrays of objects</header>
    <body>Every line of code you write introduces another place for you to write a bug. So adding test hooks to your production code, whatever form those hooks take, is adding more scope for bugs. Production code should be just what is required and no more, ie no dead code please. That is the ideal we should strive for, just as 100% coverage is the ideal we should strive for. Now in practice, for my code, I usually implement equals and hash code... But I do so *following the correct contract for equals and hashcode* One of the elements of that contract is that hashCode of two equal objects should be identical, and that it should be based on the objects final fields. often enough to warrant mentioning (though not every day), unless your objects are immutable (I like immutable objects too btw which is why this doesn't happen every day for me) you will find that the necessities of the equals and hashCode contracts with respect to collections etc, results in equals methods that only compare on a subset of the objects fields, in which case you need, in your tests, to compare on the non-final fields too. On other occasions I have found it necessary to leave the equals and hashCode methods unimplemented because I need specific behaviour within collections. In such cases I typically have test cases to verify that equals is inherited from Object so that future maintainers do not accidentally add an implementation. Normally, I use a wrapper class for adding such objects to collections so that it is safe to use equals... But that can put an excessive GC load, and as a result you may be forced to go without the  wrapper... In a sense it is a pity that the collections classes do not allow for plugable hashCode and equality strategies, Or you might have need for the Object.equals behaviour The point is that such purpose may not match the needs of testing. I agree that 95% if the time adding equals and hashCode is perfectly fine. And since we often use IDE tooling or Guava's helpers (or equivalent helpers) to implement these methods it is very low risk. My point is that there are times when it is less clear, and a subset of those where it is the wrong thing to do. You should always know *why* you are adding code to production. Adding code *just because your tests need it* is a bad code smell... It indicates that either you don't understand a production requirement of your code (which may mean that the equals method is needed anyway) or you have a bad design of your production code in the first place. Another final point is that relying on equals comparing equality as opposed to identity within your tests can hinder refactoring as it may make it harder to split the class given that you then have to take care that the equals methods are split correctly... Using duck comparison based on eg Guava's helpers is very little work and allows for correct testing.</body>

  <mail>
    <header>Re: assertArrayEquals on arrays of objects</header>
    <body>By not writing equals() and hashCode(), you have a bug in your code. This is similar to having a method in your code that is incorrect and not fixing it just for some weird YAGNI nonsense. Preventing subclasses from overriding methods that are legally overridable? Now that sounds like a big code smell to me. You seem to be subverting equals() to mean what you want it to mean, which is a big no-no in my opinion. You should always know *why* you are adding code to production. Adding code I disagree. If I have a choice between not writing a test or writing a test that requires adding to or modifying my production code, I'll choose the latter any day. Using duck comparison based on eg But it totally breaks encapsulation. -- Cédric</body>

    <body>Hi Team, Can anybody help me out how to re-rerun the failed test cases either through Ant or Programmatic. Lets say i have 10 test cases in two different Java Class files,when i run the suite,two test cases failed in each class file. I need to re-run only the failed test cases from that particular classes only not the entire classes again. Thanks, Jeevan.</body>

    <header>JUnit Mailing List Etiquette</header>
    <body>Once again, it's time for a little reminder of some of the finer points of JUnit mailing list etiquette. This will be posted now and then; not often enough to be spam, but often enough to keep our newer members aware of how we conduct business around here. Dear members and readers of the JUnit mailing list, Around here, we love testing. Not only do we love testing, we love to discuss any and all aspects of testing, often with enthusiasm and passion. This is good. This is the reason that this mailing list exists. On top of all this, we are very keen to help others understand this strange affliction we have; medical name "testus infectus", better known as being test infected. We love to answer questions and help those new to the joy move further down the road towards test enlightenment. In the classic spirit of hospitality, our list is your list, our test cases are your test cases. Please make yourself at home and enjoy the journey. :-) That said, there are some things that we don't love, so sit tight and listen up. We don't love people who haven't, or won't, read the JUnit Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document, lovingly maintained by Mike Clark or the "Smart Questions" document written and maintained by Eric S. Raymond. Here are the links, go forth and read ...  We don't love people who think that we'll do their homework assignments for them. Back when I was a lad, we didn't have the Internet and we had to do our own homework assignments without the aid of all the knowledge and information that you have available to you today. (And yes, now that you ask, I did walk uphill both ways to school through the snow.) We don't love people who are incapable of using a search engine, but are yet somehow capable of signing up onto this mailing list so that they can ask questions that ten seconds of searching would reveal the answer to. Learn how to use a search engine. Around here, Google seems quite popular. Here's a link; learn to love it and use it.  We don't love job postings. We do love having jobs (or at least, we like the pay) and we do like to look at job postings, but we like to look at them in more logical places like job websites. So, please don't be upset when a moderator deletes your carefully worded prose describing yet another testing job. We don't love thread hijacking. That's when you start a different subject by replying to a previous conversation and not even changing the subject line. We like to discuss a variety of subjects, so please feel free to be inspired to ask side-questions during ongoing conversations. Just do so by starting a fresh thread with a unique subject line. Lastly, we don't love people who whine, moan and generally sound like petulant children after they've been told that they have violated one of the "laws of the land" around here. It's a big old Internet; feel free to take your questions and/or tantrums somewhere else if you don't like the way we do things around here.

    <header>JUnit 4.11-beta-1 is released</header>
    <body>All, I am happy to announce the release of JUnit 4.11-beta-1. There have been a lot of contributions by a full cast of contributors. Thanks to everyone who took part by reporting an issue, offering his/her opinion, or even submitting a pull request! Today, we are releasing a first beta version of 4.11. The reason is simple: We want to make sure the upgrade from Hamcrest 1.1 to 1.3 goes smoothly. Therefore, we are kindly asking you to give it a try. If you find anything we should consider, please let us know, either via this mailing list or directly on GitHub: As usual, you can download the JARs or the complete ZIP file directly from  have been submitted to Maven Central and should appear there within one or two hours. You can find the preliminary release notes on GitHub and copied below:  Cheers, Marc Philipp Summary of changes in version 4.11 [unreleased!] Matchers: Upgrade to Hamcrest 1.3 JUnit now uses the latest version of Hamcrest. Thus, you can use all the available matchers and benefit from an improved assertThat which will now print the mismatch description from the matcher when an assertion fails. Example Old error message: Expected: an instance of java.lang.Integer New error message: Expected: an instance of java.lang.Integer Hamcrests new FeatureMatcher makes writing custom matchers that make use of custom mismatch descriptions quite easy: @Test Running this test will return the following failure message: Most of the matchers in JUnitMatchers have been deprecated. Please use org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers directly. Parameterized Tests In order to easily identify the individual test cases in a Parameterized test, you may provide a name using the @Parameters annotation. This name is allowed to contain placeholders that are replaced at runtime: Example @RunWith(Parameterized.class) In the example given above, the Parameterized runner creates names like [1: fib(3)=2]. If you dont specify a name, the current parameter index will be used by default. Test execution order By design, JUnit does not specify the execution order of test method invocations. Until now, the methods were simply invoked in the order returned by the reflection API. However, using the JVM order is unwise since the Java platform does not specify any particular order, and in fact JDK 7 returns a more or less random order. Of course, well-written test code would not assume any order, but some does, and a predictable failure is better than a random failure on certain platforms. From now on, JUnit will by default use a deterministic, but not predictable, order (MethodSorters.DEFAULT). To change the test execution order simply annotate your test class using @FixMethodOrder and specify one of the available MethodSorters: @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.JVM): Leaves the test methods in the order returned by the JVM. This order may vary from run to run. @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING): Sorts the test methods by method name, in lexicographic order. Maven artifacts Up until now there were two Maven artifacts for JUnit: junit:junit-dep and junit:junit. From a Maven point-of-view only the former made sense because it did not contain the Hamcrest classes but declared a dependency to the Hamcrest Maven artifact. The latter included the Hamcrest classes which was very un-Maven-like. From this release on, you should use junit:junit which will be what junit:junit-dep used to. If you still reference junit:junit-dep, Maven will automatically relocate you to the new junit:junit and issue a warning for you to fix. Rules A number of improvements have been made to Rules: Both @Rule and @ClassRule can now be used on methods that return a TestRule. ExpectedException now always prints the stacktrace of the actual exception in case of failure. A parent folder can be specified for TemporaryFolder. In addition, the newFile/newFolder methods will now fail when the file or folder could not be created. TestWatcher has a new template method called skipped that is invoked when a test is skipped due to a failed assumption. Improvements to Assert and Assume assertNotEquals has been added to Assert. assertEquals has been overloaded in order to check whether two floats are equal given a certain float delta. Most methods in Assume now allow to pass a custom message.</body>

    <body>Paul, we have deprecated the Maven artifact that used to have Hamcrest embedded since that didn't make any sense from a Maven point-of-view (see the release notes for details). The all-in-one JAR (junit.jar) is still offered as a download for users that simply want to get started using JUnit without having to download an extra JAR from Hamcrest. An alternative would be to remove the two JARs from the downloads altogether and instead put the Hamcrest JAR along with what is now called junit-dep.jar inside the JUnit ZIP file with a simple README that explains how to use it. In this scenario, there wouldn't be an old school junit.jar any longer. What do you think? Regards, Marc</body>

    <body>Hello, any improvements in hamcrest are now used for junit as well - as are all new bugs :-). There is no easy answer, I guess. As org.junit.Assert.&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;assertThat(T,org.hamcrest.Matcher&amp;lt;? super T&amp;gt;):void exists, an alternative approach to use shaded versions of the hamcrest will not work.

    <body>Here's a suggestion.  With no change to the maven packaging, here's what we make available for download. JUnit 4.11 - junit-dep.jar: no hamcrest - junit.jar: includes hamcrest - junit-nodep.jar: includes hamcrest JUnit 4.12 - junit-dep.jar: no hamcrest - junit.jar: no hamcrest - junit-nodep.jar: includes hamcrest (Long in the future, drop junit-dep.jar) So, the idea is to eventually get to a place where junit.jar does not have hamcrest, while still having an all-in-one jar, with the nodep name that is familiar from other libraries. Users who are paying attention can switch to junit-nodep now, and rest easy we won't mess with them in the future.  In 4.12, people broken by the swap in content of junit.jar can switch to junit-nodep.jar. Thoughts?</body>

    <body>Sounds like a good plan. I think we could even drop junit-dep.jar with 4.12.

I find hamcrest very useful when using Java but I haven't found a case where I would use it with Groovy and it is unfortunate design that I have to include hamrest on the classpath to keep JUnit happy but have no use for it. Some version which had a pom with hamcrest marked as optional (if it is present at all) is what I would like to see and (although somewhat more controversial) I would have a preference for all class references to hamcrest done through reflection.

    <header>Custom failed test handling</header>
    <body>I am Selenium Developer. I was trying to override the class: TestWatcher method: failed. To add some custom test failure handling (take a screenshot on test failure). However I noticed that the failed() method is invoked after the @after method is executed. Currently we are using the @after method to close the browser. So we need to execute takeAScreenShot() after a test has failed, and before the @after method is exeuted. Any suggestions? I didn't see a way to do this, without making some major changes to TestWatcher.</body>

    <header>Re: Custom failed test handling</header>
    <body>Thank you so much for the quick reply! Thats a great approach! The only thing is that some of our tests use @After to close the browser, while others use @AfterClass to close the browser. I would like to apply this custom test failure handling globally if possible. The way you've suggested would allow us to do it for all of the Test Classes that use the @After to close the browser (Which I think i'll start doing now) however it would cause all the test classes that use @AfterClass to close the browser to break. Unless I made two separate extensions from TestWatcher... One for the @After close browser and one for the @AfterClass..... wow I think that would work nicely... Is that what you would suggest? Thanks a lot -James</body>

    <header>Support for multiple Include/Exclude categories</header>
    <body>Hi! I am a user of JUnit and project contributor in github. I am glad to say that we extended Categories with new feature in pull request  This extension is not yet in KentBeck repo, however the implementation and tests are ready. In JUnit we got a consensus of anotations design and behavior, but we do not have consensus in javadoc for Categories class. We would like to ask you to have a look and help us refine the Javadoc, which finally would help to all users of JUnit. Our main goal is to declare many inclusive/exclusive categories on the top of a test suite, unlike the old Categories.java runner which used just only one category. There is Maven community with surefire-plugin, which may use this extension known as groups -currently they only use a single group.

    <header>Type safe categories</header>
    <body>Hello, we start using categories in a project to distinguish unit and integration tests using database. Our requirement is to run unit tests from within Eclipse and using Maven. The experience was rather disappointing. The support for categories in Eclipse is completely missing.  Maven plugin did not work out of the box as the wrong test executor was instantiated. Once this was fixed, we found that the category class must be available in the class path of all projects, else the plugin fails with a ClassNotFoundException. Why are categories not plain strings as in TestNG? This would prevent class not found exceptions and in addition removes the requirement to have a dependency on the single module containing the categories. If you like you can still use String constants to be "name safe". Evaluating TestNG as an alternative lead to the following results: - Good support in the Eclipse Plugin and Maven -- Groups (= categories) are found by the Eclipse plugin - TestNG does not create a new instance per test. As a consequence all fields must be set in @BeforeMethod. Using a normal constructor causes unexpected results. - @BeforeMethod is not executed, if a group is specified. There is a @BeforeGroup annotation which makes the whole thing much more complex. Best Regards Sebastian</body>

    <header>Re: Type safe categories</header>
    <body>I don't think classes are a bad idea, actually. I implemented the concept of "groups" of tests for Apache Lucene and it is annotation-based. That is: there is a meta-annotation @TestGroup that you can use to annotate your own annotations which are then recognized as groups and either enabled or disabled together. So, for example, slow tests are annotated with this thing: @Documented @Inherited @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @TestGroup(enabled = true, sysProperty = SYSPROP_SLOW) Lucene coders use multiple IDEs (and emacs, vi, etc...) and I think classes (or annotations in my case) work very well for this. One upside is that you don't need special support for test groups, you can just locate them using regular Java-element searches. Also, it's harder to make a typo, you get support for completion, annotations define additional group properties (such as system properties used to turn them on/off), etc. Obviously there are drawbacks like the ones you mentioned -- you need to reference those annotations during compilation, for example. But all in all, I'd say it's not a bad idea to use classes/ annotations for defining groups. Dawid</body>

Together with a @ClassRule capable of parsing simple predicates over strings (e.g. 'a', 'a&amp;amp;b', '(a|b)&amp;amp;c') this allows for quite fine-grained control over the set of tests being run. Cheers, Stephan  then you can use a meta annotation. implemented a runner which i am discussing in a pull request  ClassNotFoundException could be avoided due to an absent class in the classpath. tests using database. Our requirement is to run unit tests from within Eclipse and using Maven. did not work out of the box as the wrong test executor was instantiated. Once this was fixed, we found that the category class must be available in the class path of all projects, else the plugin fails with a ClassNotFoundException. class not found exceptions and in addition removes the requirement to have a dependency on the single module containing the categories. If you like you can still use String constants to be "name safe". fields must be set in @BeforeMethod. Using a normal constructor causes unexpected results. @BeforeGroup annotation which makes the whole thing much more complex.</body>

    <body>Hi! Why not having an annotation for categories at and use instead the class/package name as a feature to filter? I feel that (the need) for such an annotation implies a risk that test go easily lost (this is implemented on class-level in the RegexpSuite in the project unofficialjunit on SF). An inconvenience of this approach is the need for some rigour when naming classes and packages. On the other hand, this rigour may anyhow be needed to separate "true" unit tests from integration tests, etc. And yes, I would chip in to reimplemente categories in one way or another.

    <header>Filte, Suite and Runner</header>
    <body>Hello, my impression of filter and suites is a little bit mixed. Custom filters and custom runners are coupled and not trivial to use. I understood a suite as the place to choose classes to execute but a suite can be run with a filter which is a suite itself.  You can use a suite to control what is executed but you must explicitly name classes, use a custom runner to make use of advanced filtering like packages. Using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, using a Suite causes multiple execution of the same test and is more or less unusable. Considering issue thinking about working a little bit on filtering. My idea is that there is a set of common filter and the user can register further filters. default filters: - @Ignore which should be a filter actually as well (but isn't) - group filter - package filter To allow custom registration, we could follow the idea of the ServiceLoader provided with Java 1.6. As junit uses 1.5 we would have to reimplement a part of it but could switch to it later. Basic principle: in a directory META-INF/service you can create a file named like the interface: org.junit.runner.manipulation.Filter and in this class you add the qualified name of custom classes implementing this interface. All filters are added to the chain. Alternatively, such a config file contains only a class which can be used for the user to register additional filters and possibly other stuff. I am thinking about configuration profiles, which allows to customize multiple filters at the same time. I would consider YAML a nice format. --- profile: integration filter: groups - queueintegration - dbintegration filter: package - de.laliluna.foo - de.laliluna.bar filter: de.custom.FilterClass - max: 5 - boost: true --- profile: unit filter: groups - !queueintegration - !dbintegration filter: package - de.laliluna.foo - de.laliluna.bar filter: de.custom.FilterClass - max: 5 - boost: true --- Running the tests, you specify the configuration profile, can register custom filters if you like and have them configured.

I had this problem two more than once. One time initialization can be done more or less. One time cleanup can't be done, really. I would really like to see this in JUnit, since I execute my JUnit tests in two different IDEs and in maven. So Changing the JUnit Runner is really not a choice. We already have RunListeners, which would be nice in theory, but does not work well in IDEs.

    <body>Except when using an IDE, there I just want to: (1) select an individual test and have that run in a Debugger. Or (2) select a suite or class hierarchy and have the output appear in the JUnit window (and log window if appropriate) confirming things are still working. Agree completely here, with the caveat that _most_ situations would probably be catered for by @BeforeClass. Q: In multi-threaded mode: are multiple threads used to run the @BeforeClass code? test-suites should be administered by the build-tool. - In this case SureFire, which perhaps should support some suite/category-solution that can be applied to many test-frameworks, not only JUnit. I agree partially here. Tests should easily selectable within an IDE, in particular I want to be able to debug a specific test or run all tests with the same convenience that I can execute the debugger against the main project. Using Maven + Surefire results in added complexity that isn't really necessary. This fails with the IDE use case - IDE users quite often want to execute a suite or all tests or a particular set of tests simply by grouping... then they want to debug within that set. framework. It goes beyond testing. - He can accidently encounter it whenever he starts up a multi-threaded JVM, therewith making JVM-startup his problem domain. Therefore I think that using a javaagent would be a good pattern and - yes - my build tool can do that ... - In the Surefire-configuration you specify an "argLine" for the JVM: I disagree here. In applications (web or console based) I can already control programmatically how the logging apparatus is instantiated, meaning this isn't an issue for me in the normal case. When using JUnit in parallel test mode I can't control this at all tearDown - e.g. /home/me/projects/experiments/target/surefire-reports I'm quite sure the problem can be elegantly solved with this pattern. - And his solution can perhaps be easily reused in other projects as well as outside of the testing activities. I appreciate you've gone to great lengths to propose a general 'fits all' category of solution but I am concerned about the unintended consequences such behaviour might introduce (there might be none and I fully admit that I don't rightly know). I do know that this type of shutdown hook processing is the wrong solution for web applications (they should hook into the container life-cycle for such tasks). Essentially we're talking about controlled initialisation and shutdown of an application using whatever is the appropriate life-cycle. In this context the life-cycle is the initialisation and shutdown of JUnit or whatever testing framework being used. Containers / Frameworks that support multi-threading usually have a single-threaded initialisation and shutdown phases to enforce deterministic behaviour during these critical phases before going into full mutli-threaded mode. We are talking about a very specific case of behaviour which is ultimately caused by parallel test execution without a guaranteed deterministic stable initialisation phase. It boils down to the simple fact that there is a use case for something similar to: @BeforeAll / @AfterAll (or any appropriate naming) These should be executed serially rather than multi-threaded and considered 'reserved' only for special global setup / tear-down operations that must be executed under single-threading conditions. What's more, this should work out of the box with any IDE. As David et. al. have indicated already this is technically possible by using: (1) A common base class and locking OR (2) Annotating all classes with a special rule and using locking The problem with this solution is its logically in reverse. I would like the startup / teardown behaviour applied automatically rather than me having to decorate classes accordingly or use a specific base class. Use of a special Runner is possible I guess but would break in a IDE (which typically uses its own runner). Essentially I guess this is a necessary start-up 'aspect'  - which I suspect is, in the main, the idea you're proposing by using a Java Agent Irrespective however, the discussion is most interesting. -- Best Regards, Brett Delle Grazie</body>

    <body>Your license page seems to mention CPL down there with something about "appropriately labeled", whatever that means? In any case, the interesting question for me is how does the license of a test framework relate to the tested product? If I just write some test cases and use JUnit as a library, does the license of the test framework have any impact on me? If I release the tests? If I don't? If I include the junit.jar file with my distribution? I always think that if the framework is used as an unmodified library the license would not impact me. Perhaps if it is GPL I need to provide a link to the framework source code? But I am no expert on the licenses and this always is a bit confusing for me. What do others think?</body>

    <body>I think I see the issue, after looking in the svn repo, namely that the source tree includes .jar files, specifically junit... Therefore under apache voting rules, as we vote on the source distribution, it includes junit. A simple solution would be to use maven ant tasks or ivy to download junit from central when somebody builds the source with a view to testing. Cassandra has a good example of how to do this...

    <body>Hi Matthew, Sorry for replying late. I was caught up in a lot of other stuff. I saw the proposal for @DataProvider and it looks a good start, but IMHO it might not turn out to be a great one. Here are some reasons why I feel such apprehension: 1)The annotation currently is applied per method, which means that if there is a single class providing the input test data for 10 test methods, the user has to apply the annotation over each test method. This seems undesirable as it promotes duplicacy within the test class. Moreover, running each test method would mean extra processing, which can be avoided by making the annotation support ElementType.TYPE as well. I have a similar annotation(@DataLoader)in my test framework, EasyTest that supports such a behavior.( /easytest/annotation/DataLoader.java 2)It is not clear from the discussion which JUnit Runner will support this annotation: Parameterized or Theories or there would be a new Runner. 3)It would be nice if we give some sense of direction to the user regarding the structure of DataProviderClass and the method it supports. So, something like : 3)I somehow get the feeling(and it could be simply me and if that is the case, please ignore me) that the aspect of performing Data Driven Testing should be given more time, and proper thought should be put in around its design and the way it will be made available to the end users. I feel we should not rush into developing a feature focusing a single use case/requirement, rather we should try to first gather and understand all the aspects of Data Driven Testing and then develop that requirement as a whole rather than in pieces. I would be much more beneficial to the community as a whole. Thanks, Anuj</body>

    <body>Sorry for any misunderstanding, I agree that there are parts which need to be clarified. See my responses inline:  annotation/DataLoader.java If you have a single set of data which applies to all of the test methods, then you can use the current implementation of Parameterized. My point was that I wish to have two methods which have separate sets of data, so therefore I have to specify the DataProvider multiple times. Unless of course, you're suggesting that if we specify @DataProvider at class level, it has the same effect as the current Parameterized? I wouldn't object to that. I was planning to modify Parameterized, but a new runner would be acceptable. first thought. However, since we're specifying the name of the method in our DataProvider (if dataProviderClass is not specified), why not be able to specify it in the dataProviderClass? The main difference would be that the method would need to be static in our class, whereas in the dataProviderClass it could be non-static. 3)I somehow get the feeling(and it could be simply me and if that is the I'm not rushing, that's why I'm asking the question on the junit mailing list :-) However, I think this is a generalization of the current usage of Parameterized, and this would be useful, to me at least.

    <body>Het Matthew, I think my previous mail got lost as I cannot see it being delivered to the group even after 3 hours. So here is my response once again: 1) Parameterized runner does not work in a way that I was talking about DataLoader below. It has the drawback that if you provide a single set of test data for multiple methods, it will pass all the test data to all the methods. Have a look at this blog post for more clarification of the Parameterized Runner and its drawback:  2) I feel a new runner would be a better approach although I do not know what all feature set will this runner support. 3) I feel it is easier and also simpler if we get rid of the whole idea of providing method names. I say this because in real world scenario, no two test methods will have exactly the same set of test data. Thus the name of the method should suffice instead of asking the user to explicitly specify the method name in the annotation. But thats just my approach. I feel this requires more input from the community. Cheers! Anuj  annotation/DataLoader.java</body>

    <body>I'm glad this discussion is going on.  I don't have a comprehensive opinion yet, but did want to tip my hand on one bias, in case it guides future conversation. I'm not likely to be very keen on adding any features to JUnit core whose primary motivation is to reduce the number of classes in a suite.  If a user wants to do two different things, but have them accessible in the file system in one place, the Enclosed runner is always available: @RunWith(Enclosed.class) IMHO, classes are how Java groups methods and data that belong together. I'm reluctant to introduce new ways of grouping (such as annotations on methods that contain the names of other methods) if equivalent class-based techniques will work.  annotation/DataLoader.java</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Feedback Required | Extending Junit to perform Data Driven Testing</header>
    <body>One thing that you can't do is stack runners, so you can't use Enclosed in conjunction with other runners. I'm sure there was an issue to allow multiple runners for a test class, but I can't find it now. I think this is an avenue to explore anyway. My motivation here is to group all my tests for one class together in one test class, it's true. Instead of having one FooTest, I've got FooTest, FooBarTest, FooBazTest. If you don't like names of methods (which I can understand), what if we had a class name which was instantiated (like the dataProviderClass in my example), which had to implement an interface? This require a local static class for each test, which would be acceptable. Bit more boilerplate, but never mind. Using this gist: names are not fixed, and that the method of running isn't decided (but I would prefer to use Parameterized). Matthew Farwell.  annotation/DataLoader.java</body>

Is this the correct assumption or did I misinterpret it? if it is then I also agree with you that having a class level annotation is more beneficial than having a method level annotation. That's what EasyTest(my extension to JUnit) now has in the form of @DataLoader(although for flexibility and completeness purposes it is also available at the method level.)

    <header>Re: Feedback Required | Extending Junit to perform Data Driven Testing</header>
    <body>A Side note first: The gist has a comma along with it, therefore it doesn't work when clicked. :) Matthew, being a JUnit user for so long, personally I would repel at the idea of writing static classes that extend an interface in my test class. Here are my reasons: 1) It makes the whole process of writing test cases more complicated. Also, the writing test cases is now coupled with writing test data. A tester cannot work exclusively on writing test data without concerning  himself from the test cases. This leads to coupling. We should allow the user to write test data separately from the test case. 2) We, as developers, get only a fraction of the time to write test cases, and therefore the less time we have to spend on writing and executing the test cases, the better. 3) There is a problem of maintenance here. I personally believe that, the less you make a user depend on your framework, the better it is. Junit's @Test is actually a classic example of how easy it is to get up and running without the user thinking about any external dependencies. The user doesn't have to follow a nice learning curve and know the APIs. That's where annotations are so powerful. 4) In your above gist as well(just like the previous one), a user has to provide annotation at the method level, which, as I pointed out before, can and ideally should be avoided. The user should be able to say(in terms of writing test cases) something like : "Here is my test data which contains data for each test method I have in my test class. Now run all the methods that are Tests and pass the right parameters to them." Well, that's where atleast my money lies and that's what I have tried to capture in EasyTest. Again, it is a philosophical discussion which can have a lot of rights and wrongs. Whenever I design any software, my philosophy always is: "Think about what the users would be required to learn/code about my software, in order to get up and running with my system." The less the user needs to learn and depend on an external system, the better and faster the development. Obviously, there are situations where certain things cannot be avoided, and then we make informed decisions. :) Cheers! Anuj  annotation/DataLoader.java</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Feedback Required | Extending Junit to perform Data Driven Testing</header>
    <body>I really think that you don't understand my use case here, I'm sorry. This is my use case. I have a class which contains multiple methods that I wish to test. Each test requires it's own, specific data set. I cannot use Parameterized because I must define a constructor, and I cannot have multiple constructors. I would like to make my job easier by being able to say test this method with this dataset. I use Parameterized a lot, and I have absolutely no problem with defining the data in my class, just like it is suggested in the javadoc for Parameterized. If I could use the same data set for all of the methods I wished to test, then I could use the current implementation of Parameterized. So see my comments inline. You don't use Rules? These are effectively the same thing. You extend a class/interface and reimplement a method. Effectively the same thing here. I can understand what you're saying about separation of tests &amp;amp; test data, but that's not what I want to do. I have no problem with the data and tests being in the same physical file. In fact, I prefer that because I'm doing unit testing. In the past, I have defined my test data in another file, but that's not what I'm talking about here. 2) We, as developers, get only a fraction of the time to write test cases, I don't understand what you're trying to say in either of these points. Like I say above, if I could define something at class level, then I wouldn't need to add this functionality to JUnit. Also, in your easytest framework, you have annotation which applies at method level, so I don't what you're objecting to.  annotation/DataLoader.java</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Feedback Required | Extending Junit to perform Data Driven Testing</header>
    <body>The main difference between Rule and what you suggest is that Rule acts as a true composition where the class it is being used in doesnt define the behavior of the Rule, instead it uses the Behavior. In your case you are defining as well as using the behavior in the same class.  This is a perspective issue. I always look at the fact that a single class should define and handle single behavior. As far as DataLoader annotation goes in the EasyTest framework, the biggest difference between what you suggest in your gist and what DataProvider does is that a user is not required to use @DataProvider at the method level. He can simply use the annotation at the class level and the framework will take care of the rest. A user can simply say @test on its test method and the framework will take care of the rest. As I said before, the functionality of applying the DataLoader annotation at the method level is for completeness purpose and not a mandatory requirement. And I am not objecting to your solution of asking a user to provide a static class per test method, but I am presenting my view point that I would personally not be using such a Runner/behavior. But again that is just me. There could be a lot of people who may find this idea very interesting. But I am not one of them unfortunately :(. Cheers!  annotation/DataLoader.java</body>

I like the basic use of annotations in JUnit 4 but I prefer to have any more complex stuff written in the code and not in the annotations. Of course, it is nice to have the option and support those who like a different type of an approach. Just saying... :) Teemu</body>

    <header>Tests starting before Logback initialisation complete when run in parallel</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm using JUnit 4.10 with Maven 3.0.4, Surefire 2.12.3, JDK 1.6.0_35 on Windows 7 Surefire is configured with parallel=methods and threadCount=10 For logging, I'm using SLF4J to Logback, initialised by default method (i.e. configuration file logback-test.xml is on the test classpath) I have an order of initialisation problem in that: (1) Some unit tests test classes that use commons-logging (and logback via jcl-slf4j) but are ending up with Null loggers. (2) jcl-slf4j is not initialised _until_ those classes are called. If I disable parallelism the code works correctly, implying an order of initialisation issue. According to the most recent FAQ on Junit.org (Section 5, #3) I could use @BeforeClass and @AfterClass at the class level but I'm talking about at the global level, something that needs to be executed even if only a single test is run. What is the correct method to add global, one-time, setup / tear-down hooks? In this case they would need to execute and complete (i.e. blocking) before any parallel tests are run. Is it simplest to override the Runner and initialise the logging in code there? Thanks, Best Regards, Brett</body>

IMHO, during the constant changes, we should be able to hold on to the simple things and build on top of that to accommodate the changing requirements.

The main benefit it gives is the ability to control data and test separately, which results in less coupling and ultimately better maintenance. EasyTest is trying to achieve exactly that by extending JUnit in a way  that its simplicity is conserved(EasyTest works with @Test annotations) and at the same time users have the ability to specify the data outside of their test classes.

    <body>Hi, I'm glad someone else spoke up.Â  Though I'm a very infrequent user of JUnit, I must confess that getting the daily emails about the enhanced capabilities of JUnit these days has shown a possibly powerful tool that's become a little byzantine for the casual user to be able to work with. One thing I haven't seen is something that bridges the knowledge gap.Â  What I mean is, JUnit's been around for many years now, but to my knowledge, outside of this group, there's still only two useful websites and even those (at last check) don't seem as comprehensive as they could be (comparing it to something like the Java SE API, for example).Â  So there's all this esoterica being discussed here, and the websites look like they haven't been updated in years.Â  There's a gap there.Â  I find myself getting lost in casually following these discussions thinking, "What if you just want to run a test class to unit-test an application class?Â  What is all this fancy stuff going on now and these different strange names and applications people are using?"Â  I've done enough non-JUnit unit testing to know how the tool should be useable for those applications, but I am definitely lost when it comes to TestRunners and all this other stuff I've seen. This isn't really a complaint so much as an observation.Â  Thanks for reading.

    <body>Mike, Two quick thoughts: 1) There's definitely a documentation gap.  Thanks for prodding me on this fact--I have an idea of how we might be able to bootstrap something fairly quickly on this. 2) I _hope_ that JUnit's simplicity hasn't disappeared.  I may be living in a filter bubble, but my feeling is that the things that should be easy have stayed easy.  Much of the more esoteric discussion on this list is around making some hard things possible.  That is, 99% of JUnit users just use JUnit, and don't participate in the "community", per se.  80% of the discussion on this list tends to be around the work of the other 1% of extenders and developers. Definitely curious to hear feedback on this angle.  Thanks,</body>

    <body>All, There's been feedback on the list recently (and, well, much longer ago than recently) that JUnit could really use a master documentation layer.  There have been organizational, technical, and political reasons why we've fallen behind on this. Here's what seems to be the Simplest Thing that could Possibly Work: Let's work together to build a core of documentation at the wiki on the junit project at github:  From here on out, before accepting pull requests, I will: 1) Make sure that there's an obvious place on the wiki where documentation for the new feature should live. 2) Make sure the submitter has added documentation there. After a month or so, if it looks like the wiki has momentum, I'll make sure that junit.sourceforge.net and junit.org prominently feature the wiki as the point of most up-to-date and useful information. Thoughts?  Thanks,</body>

    <header>Re: Tests starting before Logback initialisation complete when run in parallel</header>
    <body>Brett, There's currently not a good single way to do what you want.  There's current conversation on the github repo about how to do it in a future version, but there's no great first-step answer. One possibility is to add a @BeforeClass or @ClassRule to each of your tests that would, in a thread-safe way, check if your initialization has already been performed, and if not, do it.  I know that's not a great solution.</body>

    <header>Re: Tests starting before Logback initialisation complete when run in parallel</header>
    <body>Hi Mirko, No, commons-logging is explicitly excluded. The problem is definitely due to parallelism configuration. Disabling parallelism via 'none' in maven resolves the issue but obviously executes the tests slower. Essentially what happens is Logback is still executing its auto-initialisation while some tests start to write to the logs resulting in lost log information. As noted by another post in this thread, I'll have to serialise the initialisation explicitly. Thanks, Brett</body>

    <header>Re: Tests starting before Logback initialisation complete when run in parallel</header>
    <body>Such "global, one-time, setup / tear-down" is outside the scope of JUnit, according to me. You should turn to your test-running tool on this one, i.e. Surefire. Surefire is your tool to organize which tests to run when and how. JUnit is glue between Surefire and the JUnit test-classes. About your problem I think you have put yourself in a corner by trying to run all tests in parallel in the same JVM. Even if you could use "global, one-time, setup / tear-down" you still put very strict limits on what your test-classes can safely do and I simply don't think it is worth it. I strongly advice you to rethink here and configure Surefire with forkMode="perthread", so that parallel test-executions take place in separate JVM-processes. cheers /Henrik there?</body>

    <header>Splitting up and parameterizing "common" tests</header>
    <body>Hello. I have a set of packages, let's call them "database-core", "database-sqlite", "database-postgres". The database-core package exposes an interface type DB, and the database-sqlite and database-postgres packages both expose types that implement the DB interface: DBSqlite and DBPostgres, respectively. I have a huge pile of tests in the database-sqlite package, and a huge pile of tests in the database-postgres package. Now here's the problem: These enormous piles of tests that exercise these two types are basically identical bar the different specific DB implementation type. What I'd like to do is somehow move all of these tests into the database-core package and have the tests work with the DB interface type only. The database-sqlite package would then obviously instantiate a DBSqlite value and somehow pass it as a parameter to these tests. The database-postgres package would do the same. This would obviously give some extra confidence that the two implementations have the same semantics (at least with regards to the parts of the code the tests end up executing). What's the correct/simplest way to do this with JUnit 4?</body>

    <body>Esko's solution is the most common (and likely best) approach. If you have a large number of tests, however, it could be tedious and a bit error prone; you would need to have two subclasses of each test. If you forget to add a DBSqlite version of your test, you have less code coverage than you think you do (of course, that's probably the case with your code now). If all of the tests work with both database types, you might want to try to indicate which database to use via a system property, and run all of the tests twice. If you do this, new tests could automatically be run using both DB implementations. It would mean that your tests would depend on both implementations, and if you wanted to run the tests in your IDE you would have to set the system property to specify which implementation to use. -- Kevin -- Kevin  actors/ActorsContract.java  actors/MultiThreadedActorsTest.java  actors/SingleThreadedActorsTest.java</body>

    <header>Re: Splitting up and parameterizing "common" tests</header>
    <body>To solve your problem is one of the major purposes of CallbackParams:  With CallbackParams you can have enum-classes provide parameter-values. In your case I can suggest an enum-class "DBFactory", which has one constant "POSTGRES" to provide the DBPostgres implementation and another constant "SQLITE" to provide the DBSqlite implementation: You can then have your test-classes use the JUnit-runner CallbackParamsRunner ...  ParamsRunner.html ... and the field-annotation @ParameterizedValue ...  lue.html ... to parameterize your "common" test-classes: @RunWith(CallbackParamsRunner.class) The test-class ACommonTest will be run twice - once for each constant in DBFactory. The field database will be injected with the enum-constant POSTGRES on the first run and SQLITE on the second run. Your tests will get proper names: - testMethod[database=POSTGRES] - testMethod[database=SQLITE] One of the major objectives for CallbackParams is to simplify future maintenance, such as when you decide to support another database, such as Oracle. All you need to do for the tests is to add another constant "ORACLE" to your enum-class - and all of your test-classes will suddenly test Oracle as well. Good luck /Henrik</body>

    <body>bakgat73 wrote on 27.7.2012 17:04: Even though your production code can't use reflection, it should be possible to use it in tests if you can run the tests on your desktop using the standard JRE. With most build tools this means keeping the production and the test code in different modules, so that you can configure them different JDKs. If that is not possible, then here are some ideas: Making JUnit uses reflection for finding out all test methods from a class, and without reflection it would require lots of boilerplate to explicitly call all those methods. An option would be to create your own framework (maybe reusing JUnit's assertions) or start based on a framework which uses reflection very little. For example my Specsy testing framework ( reflection only when instantiating the test class [1], because the tests are declared using closures (in the Java version they will be anonymous inner classes, see this draft [2] on the syntax). Hard-coding that instatiation would require only a single-method factory class for each test class. In the near future I'll rewrite Specsy in Java (it will be called Specsy 2), and create thin frontends at least for Java, Scala and Groovy. After that it might be possible to fork it and create a reflection-free Java 1.3 compatible version. Specsy 2 and the Jumi test runner ( uses very little reflection so it might be possible to fork and extract a limited Java 1.3 compatible version of it. Creating your own testing framework is actually quite easy, if you just keep the scope small. Without support for running tests in parallel, it is possible to implement the same programming model as in Specsy, plus a small test runner for it, in 10-50 hours. I wrote NanoSpec.go [3] in 6 hours (about 300 LOC production code) and it uses Go's minimal test runner [4] (about 400 LOC), which would not take much longer to implement either.

    <header>Extension to Junit Theories | Data Driven Testing in a more consistent way</header>
    <body>Hi, I have been in talks with David Saff regarding how the current implementation of JUnit Theories limits its users to perform Data Driven Testing. Also the data handling(permutation of all the data set) by Theories is not something that assist in performing data driven testing. All this and more resulted in I agreeing to David's suggestion of submitting an initial extension to Theories Runnner that handles data in a consistent way and provides users the ability to extend the framework. So here is the link to the initial source code that supports new features for doing Data Driven Testing :  Majorly the support is in form of annotations. There is also a sample test in the repository that explores most of the new features introduced. I am looking forward to your suggestions of how you feel about the extension and what can be improved so that it can be used by JUnit as an extension to Theories Runner. Cheers! Anuj Kumar</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Feedback Required | Extending Junit to perform Data Driven Testing</header>
    <body>Hello, Sorry this took so long to get back to you, but I was trying to get my thoughts together. I don't believe that the suggestion below fits in with the current JUnit philospohy, so doesn't belong in the junit core library. Specifically, I don't think CSV/Excel/XML parsing belongs in JUnit, so I agree with your decision to write it as an extension rather than as part of junit core. However, I do believe that we can add stuff to JUnit core in order to allow people to do this sort of thing more easily, and maybe help you with your code as well. I often have the following problem: I've got a class Foo in which I'm testing multiple methods (foo#addInts &amp;amp; foo#addStrings). So I create a single class to test the two. But if either of these methods are better tested using parameterized, then I can't do it because I have to define the constructor. So, what I would propose is to have a @DataProvider annotation which specifies a method to call which returns a collection of data for this particular method. The test method is called for each item in the list. See this would be fairly easy to do. I also think this would be extensible in another framework, specifically in your case. All you should have to do is extend the @DataParameter so that the data comes from another source. Again, see the gist, you'd just have to specify a dataProviderClass. What do people think of this idea, and what do you (anuj) think also? Thanks. Matthew Farwell.</body>

    <header>Re: Android Notification Bar Testing</header>
    <body>The answer will depend a lot on the details of your app and OS.  In many cases, teams find the most value in simulating these kinds of UI interactions in their automated tests: when the notification is clicked, it generates some kind of call back into the app.  Your automated test simply verifies that the call out to the notification manager is made, and then explicitly triggers the call back into the app. It is true that this kind of test will not catch, for example, if you've made a wrong assumption about the notification manager API, and are calling it in a way that looks good in the test, but doesn't actually create an on-screen notification.  Many teams find that occasionally manually testing the app/UI integration is cheap and sufficient to catch these kinds of errors. Good luck,</body>

If you can't, then you might want to ask around on the robotium lists or something similar to get a bigger chance of hearing from someone who's faced your exact problem. Good luck,</body>

    <body>Normally, the typical way to solve a problem like this would be to write some code to see if the constraints of the problem are met. In this case, go through the chess board, and when you find a queen, see if it is attacking another queen. If it is, call Assert.fail(). The only tricky part is finding a useful way to represent the chess board (and, possibly, making the failure message print something useful). Given that there are a few well-known solutions to this problem, however, I would be tempted to do something more radical: see if the current board matches one of the well known solutions.

    <header>Any libraries for launching junit tests in a separate JVM?</header>
    <body>Are there any open-source libraries out there for launching junit tests and reporting back the results (such as might be done by an IDE, similar to Eclipse's JDT RemoteTestRunner, but intended to be reused by others) ? I've found the several projects that have internal components that do this, but I'm curious to know if there are any stand-alone libraries that provide an API for this sort of functionality.

For example (complex) configuration of running tests in parallel take a look at Apache Lucene project (in trunk) because it uses &amp;lt;junit4&amp;gt; internally. Dawid</body>

    <body>Dawid Weiss wrote on 29.6.2012 11:56: My goals for developing Jumi are wider than that and I don't think that it would be possible to reuse anything JUnit-specific. Some of the main reason for creating a new test runner was to better support testing frameworks which (1) don't know what tests there are before executing them, (2) contain nested tests. For example specs, ScalaTest and Specsy (by me, categories. The causes of these issues are implicit assumptions in JUnit's Runner interface and overcoming them requires changing the API. Other goals relate to usability. For example I think that all current IDEs and build tools suffer from the issue that the following code in a test won't print "abc", but will more probably print "acb" or "bac": Also it's not possible to run with one command all tests of a multi-module Maven project in IDEA or Eclipse, when different modules have conflicting classpaths (such as different versions of the same library) or their tests require module-specific working directories (which IIRC is the default in Maven Surefire Plugin).

    <header>Implementing an unstable test rule</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm trying to implement a test rule that handles unstable tests. It's made up of the test rule itself, plus an Unstable annotation that you can put either on the class or on a single method. The way I wrote it is similar to  diately, Normally before a test method is invoked, the test class fields are initialized. The problem with the retry is that since the same statement is reused, the fields will not be re-initialized between retries. I've tried to find a solution to this. It looks to me like I would have to create my own test runner to achieve this, which ideally I would like to avoid. Am I correct in that I have to create a custom test runner, or can it be done in some other way? Thanks Daniel</body>

    <header>How to set a global counter for several test cases</header>
    <body>Hello experts, I am working on a project having several Junit 4.10 test cases driven by Ant, requirement of adding detection of failed tests is brought up. Specifically, it require us to implement a global counter for all tests, the counter record the number of failure, once it exceed this limit number, do something. For example, we have Test case A, B; each has three tests. The whole test begin with Test A. Assume 2 tests of A failed, the counter is 2; then B begin, 1 test of B failed. Eventually the counter is 3. But I did some experiments, seem like each test case will be running in a separate JVM process. It is quite tricky to share a counter between two process. I look through the API, maybe this requirement can be done with custom runner, though we do want change too much and continue to use Ant - Junit runner. Please give me some hints on this issue.

I do not say it is evil (like kicking small puppies), just be careful with it. :)  Such approach steers you towards testing of class methods, which is fine, but testing of class responsibilities is what you goal should really be! The difference is (sometimes) subtle, but important in the long run. P.S.

    <header>parameterized test with multiple test methods</header>
    <body>Is the parameterized test class intended to have only one test method? I have created parameterized test classes with multiple test methods that use the same parameters with apparent success. However, when I tried it with a new test class yesterday JUnit didn't behave in the expected way. This is in RAD 8.0.4 using JUnit 4.8.1. The assertEquals in the second test method is reported as a failure even though the method being tested returned the correct results (I traced through with debug to verify). JUnit appended the result from the first test method to the result from the second test method and reported the second method as a failure because the combined result didn't match the expected result. Am I using the parameterized test incorrectly by having multiple test methods or is there a bug in JUnit?</body>

    <header>Testing of OSGi declarative services</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm not able to test a OSGi declarative service with a JUnit Plugin Test in Eclipse. Although all necessary bundles (especially the Service, the Consumer with the JUnit Test class, org.eclipse.equinox.ds, org.eclipse.equinox.util, org.eclipse.jdt.junit.runtime and org.eclipse.pde.junit.runtime) are added to the Run Configuration of the Plugin Test and the bind/unbind methods are defined in the test class it comes to an Null Pointer Exception (the bind method seems to be not executed), if I access the Service attribute (e.g. public static IMyService myService) in a JUnit Test method. According to this site  e-context-of-a-junit-test the reason for this exception is that the OSGi framework is in a race condition with the JUnit tests runner context. The solution there to use a Count Down Latch that waits in a @Before method until the needed service (that should be tested) is binded, seems to be not working for me. In my case the await() method blocks infinitely, so the test will be never executed. On the other hand, if I define a maximum time to wait, e.g. await(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS), it comes after this time again to the Null Pointer Exception. What is the correct way to test a OSGi declarative service with JUnit? Any help is appreciated. Regards, Rene</body>

I assumed that each of the tests would get the parameters as they are defined in the parameter section, not after they've been modified by a previous test method. I'm used to the 3.8 "every test starts out fresh" idea. That isn't happening. One of the parameters is "new StringBuilder()". I expected both methods to get an empty StringBuilder. But, the second method is getting the StringBuilder with the contents added in the first method. I tried resetting it in an @After method just to see what happens. The code to set it to a new StringBuilder is executed but the second test method still gets the StringBuilder with the contents added by the first method. Is this the expected behavior?</body>

    <body>Marques, Have you worked your way through the JUnit FAQ? It's available online for reading and (if my memory serves me correctly) it would have been sent to you when you subscribed to this list.  This is only intended to help beginners, so it doesn't cover everything, but it should be a good start. After that, there are a number of JUnit books available on the market. Some example code is always good and there are often unit tests in open-source Java projects that you can review. I have a couple of JUnit example projects up on Github that you may care to look at. They were specifically written to help people with learning JUnit so they have extra comments for the tests.  Hope this helps.

    <header>The order of default builders.</header>
    <body>Hi everyone, So, AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder has ignoredBuilder() before annotated builder as shown here: @Override List&amp;lt;RunnerBuilder&amp;gt; builders= Arrays.asList( ignoredBuilder(), annotatedBuilder(), I understand this was done to enforce consistent handling of @Ignore at class level but it sucks if you want to have a custom runner that wishes to handle @Ignore on class in a different manner. In particular, I'm looking to report the descriptions of all ignored unit tests (rather than just skipping the entire class). Changing the order above will most likely break annotated runners that are not prepared to handle class-level @Ignore. Any other suggestions/ options how this could be solved? This could be a tweak to IgnoredBuilder to delegate to a sub-runner if it sees @RunWith and then just fire ignore events for each individual test? Dawid</body>

    <header>Re: The order of default builders.</header>

  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: The order of default builders.</header>
    <body>This would be Situation 2. I have a custom runner (not descending from JUnit) specifically to target things like reporting (that is -- I would like to know which tests were ignored if a suite is ignored, not just skip them silently). This is possible if somebody explicitly creates my runner with a suite class but not via factory (JUnitCore or Request) because then Ignore takes precedence over RunWith. Dawid</body>

    <header>Re: The order of default builders.</header>
    <body>Hi David, Yeah, well... I already wrote my Runner implementation --  There are benefits of having a custom, cleanroom-rewritten Runner -- I can experiment with features I wouldn't be able to implement if I descended from JUnit's default Runner implementation. This is a long story. My question/ issue is that I thought @RunWith would take precedence over anything else -- virtually pass control to a custom runner to handle all events and deal with contracts. This is the case with everything _except_ @Ignore-on-suite-class which causes a different runner implementation to be used. would that give you what you're looking for? Digressinon - I actually implemented suite-listeners in that runner of mine and they work great:  /main/java/com/carrotsearch/examples/randomizedrunner/Test014Listeners.java But again -- what I would like to see is this: JUnitCore.run(MyTestClass.class) always pass control to a runner designated in @RunWith. Currently if MyTestClass has an @Ignore, the custom runner will not be even called. I guess this qualifies as a request for a backwards incompatible change :( Dawid</body>

  <mail>
    <header>Re: The order of default builders.</header>
    <body>Not a perfect solution, but you could add your own custom annotation for this purpose. Your custom runner would check if the target class has this annotation, and if so, return child runners that do nothing but the reporting. -- Kevin</body>

Yes, I could do this, like I did with other things (for example I support meta-annotation @TestGroup which allows one to define custom annotations like @Nightly, @Slow, etc. and disable/enable them as a group). This works much like an auto-assumption; you can see the test results from Apache Lucene here (grep for @Nightly or @AwaitsFix to see group-ignored tests):  But then... @Ignore works great and is well defined (and most importantly users already know what it does). The only unexpected thing (to me) is that on-class @Ignore doesn't even attempt to retrieve the descriptions tree. Don't get me wrong -- I do understand the design rationale for having on-class @Ignore served by another runner, but at the same I just disagree that it is a right decision. I think there should be something like a "certification test" for Runner implementations and the contract on passing on-class @Ignore should be that it doesn't execute any test (run count == zero). The number of ignored tests should be up to the Runner (either ignore the suite or each test separately). Dawid</body>

    <header>Best practices to keep scenarios outside of the unit test</header>
    <body>Hello all, I'm looking for a good way to keep scenarios stored outside of the unit tests.  Basically I'm thinking of some way to do black box testing based on some files, hopefully something simple enough that a non programmer can take look at and modify. Some thing that takes a few inputs for a function and lists the expected output. Something like but obviously for much more complicated tests: input1=1 input2=2 output=3 input1=2 input2=2 output=4 Any ideas on how to do this? Thanks, Andres</body>

    <body>This problem has been solved many times already. For example, take a look at JBehave. It uses JUnit to run tests that are specified in Given/When/Then format. The language of each Given/When/Then can be defined by programmers and the test scenarios edited in a text file by non-technical people. Other tools for specifying acceptance (IE. "black box") tests include Fit, Robot Framework, Cucumber, etc. Don't limit yourself to JUnit. Good books include Fit for Developing Software (Rick Mugridge et al) and The Cucumber Book (Matt Wynne and Aslak Hellesoy).

    <header>Re: The order of default builders.</header>
    <body>Dawid, Imagine a developer being dropped into a new project.  There are JUnit tests using custom runners she's never seen, and some of those are failing. She'd like to Ignore some of the failing test classes, and focus in on a couple to fix first.  I think that there's value in being able to trust @Ignore to always Just Work, even if the custom runners being used are faulty in various ways. So the current functionality stays. I can definitely understand wanting to attach a suite listener, though, so if you're interested in pursuing contribution of that code, let me know. Thanks,</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: The order of default builders.</header>
    <body>Like I mentioned I can understand this rationale but I still differ in opinion. If there are custom runners that fail to comply with @Ignore contract they are badly broken, that's all. Whether to cater for badly broken code that should fulfill contracts is a philosophical question. I accept this decision even if I don't like the consequences. Sorry for being slow but how could this help me? And how would this be different from attaching a listener to JUnitCore? Recall I would like to retrieve a tree of Descriptions from a suite class annotated with an @Ignore annotation. Dawid</body>

  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: The order of default builders.</header>
    <body>See, that's the problem -- I have no control over what the use case of invoking the suite class is. It can be invoked from Ant, Eclipse or somewhere else. I think most use cases are JUnitCore.runClass but I cannot rule out using Request or other combinations -- hard to tell, really. I wouldn't be asking for it but aside from the Runner implementation I also have a custom Ant task (to run tests in parallel JVMs among other features) and for this it'd be very nice to be able to list all ignored tests, including those from ignored suites. If not for anything else, you can then sum up how many individual test cases you have in your project... Currently what is available to a RunListener when @Ignore is invoked on a suite is 0 executed tests, 0 ignored tests, 0 failed tests - I think this is odd. I also agree with Cedric that the reason for an ignored test (or assumption-ignored test) is an important thing to have available in listeners. This is particularly itching with RunListeners because test ignored callback doesn't provide any means of passing a cause (unlike an assumption). This can be worked around using some trickery -- and I do that in randomizedtesting package -- but again -- it's an API constraint that is hard to overcome. Dawid</body>

    <header>Not sure if JUnit can be used how I need it... suggestions?</header>
    <body>Hi :) I'm working on a project for university, which is about a website to teach the basics of Java programming. It'll have some programming lessons and then some exercises for the user to practise by typing them in a textbox that will then send its contents to a servlet. The servlet will compile the code (creating a .class file) and return some results (success or compiling errors). So far so good. But I'd also like to test that the user created an appropriate solution to the excercise, and I was thinking of doing so with JUnit. My problem is I can't think of a way to do it (I've never used JUnit before). Any ideas? Thanks!! Patricia.</body>

    <header>Re: Not sure if JUnit can be used how I need it... suggestions?</header>
    <body>That's a very general question. JUnit does not do much more than execute a bunch of tests and give you assertions to test. (It does give you some more "fancy" tricks, like Rules and Runners as an addon.) As long as you can write some test code that executes the not yet written class/method in a reliable way, I think it should be possible. Greetings,</body>

Presently, I'm developing part of a simulation system in Java for work, and I plan on using JUnit as part of NetBeans to do unit testing to bulletproof my code.  My question is, as I understand it, I can write a class and then "right-click to generate JUnit test class" or something.  So what happens when I update my real class with additional fixes and/or functionality?  Does NB/JU know to automatically update the test class, or do I have to regen the test class?

    <header>Displaying test case name from the testcase</header>
    <body>Forgive me if this is a FAQ, but I have tried digging through the documentation and the answer was not apparent. I am writing some test cases.  As part of the testing, I want to keep a log of the responses from the code for debugging purposes.  It would be really helpful to have some simple process to print out the tests name and other properties into the log.  Since there are hundreds of tests, I would like to make this a common step (ie call a method) to do this.  Problem is finding the name of the test itself (without having to pass it into the logging method or hacking the stack). I see there is a Description class in the runner.  Is there any way to access the runner (i.e. a singleton or static getter) from the test case?</body>

    <body>Thanks Matthew. I will try writing out the reports from a RunListener. If they can be registered by both the Ant and Maven plugins, that's pretty good. Eclipse is another story: after a cursory search, I don't see a way to register custom RunListeners in Eclipse's JUnit launcher. There is a method in org.eclipse.jdt.junit.JUnitCore for registering RunListeners, but nothing I can find in the UI for specifying one. Worst case, I suppose I could just register the RunListener from within my Runner, perhaps only when enabled by a system property.

    <header>Runner for maven</header>
    <body>Hi, I maintain the junit provider for maven-surefire, and I'm looking into transitioning from  a Junitcore+RunListener based approach to an approach based on something like BlockJUnit4ClassRunner. Unfortunately I cannot subclass the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner since the client code itself may need to do that, so I'd somehow need to put "my" Runner in front of the client-supplied one, maybe something proxy like.

    <header>Re: Runner for maven</header>
    <body>Hi Kristian Do you really want a transition from RunListener? To an outside observer - a JUnit Runner "describes" its test-executions and reports their outcome to the RunNotifier, which forward the info to RunListener, which is the interface that 3rd-party test-running applications (e.g. IDEs, Maven-Surefire etc) are expected to use. I have seen IDE-project test-extensions try to go beyond RunListener/RunNotifier and start to joggle with Runner internals (e.g. test-instance creation/setup, method-executions etc) and the result is something I don't like much. It works for simple cases but with customized Runner-classes and new JUnit-features (e.g. the introduction of JUnit-Rules) the result is usually bad and it discourages the IDE users (i.e. the developers) from taking full advantage of JUnit! However, Maven (versions 2.0-2.2) and its Surefire-plugin has handled the JUnit-integration wonderfully, as far as I know, so your post worries me a little. What is it that you want to accomplish by moving away from the successful(!) "Junitcore+RunListener based approach"?

If you still think you need the output, why not use a logger (log4j), which adds all the information you need? Refactoring should be very easy. As I'm starting to learn and play with AspectJ, I'd try that (but would not bet money on this being a good idea).

    <header>Re: Re: Runner for maven</header>
    <body>Hi Kristian, We had a similar issue. I was debating for a longer while if it makes sense to run parallel tests within the same VM. In many situations this speeds things a lot and has a nice memory conserving footprint but you cannot guarantee tests won't interact with each other (in the simplest case via mutating system properties). Finally the decision was to do it like Apache Lucene did it -- split tests into parallel slave VMs with repeatable suite execution order and sequential test execution within a single VM. This is implemented in an ANT task called junit4 here.  JUnit tests inside will give you a hint how to use it, the code is still very fresh so documentation is scarce. Now... this was a digression. Back to your question (because we did go that route as well, only backed up), one possible solution to isolating sysout/syserrs of parallel tests in a single VM is: 1) isolate each suite (for @BeforeClass/ @AfterClass hooks) into a separate thread which you have under control. This can be either a custom @Runner or a Computer, many ways to achieve it. 2) write a PrintStream implementation that redirects to a thread-local buffer. This gist implements a similar idea to demux multiple thread streams so that each one's output appears on a single line; you'll get the idea I'm sure.  3) once you have the above the rest is easy: replace default System.out/System.err (I assume no security manager is present or it allows such replacement), clear the buffer before suite, run your suite, flush the buffer. The buffer's content will be your thread's output even though system.* are singletons. Like I said though -- I would consider using multiple jvms for running parallel tests instead. Dawid</body>

    <header>Re: Runner for maven</header>
    <body>maven-surefire now also supports concurrent forks, and they don't have any of the interaction problems you describe - as you know. Since surefire is an all-purpose runner, we try to support any "sensible" mode of execution, and there are good use cases for both models of execution. Your first suggestion seems to work quite well, using the Computer I just wrap the created runner in another runner that attaches the testclass to the thread (and delegates on to the target Runner), which we pick up in reporting. Surefire does all the other stuff already, but I'm thinking we might be deprecating "both" mode threading support because it becomes such a pain to do correctly, at least it requires a tight collaboration between the RunListener and the Computer.

    <body>I'm already working on something like that. I'm writing a new test runner called Jumi running tests in parallel in the same JVM, and it take care of capturing the System.out/err of individual tests. Jumi will do the output capturing by replacing System.out/err with its own implementation, which saves all print events (the same way it saves test lifecycle events), synchronizes both out and err (I think all current IDEs and build tools fail this:  bugs/SystemOutErrBugTest.java and also takes care of capturing the output of threads spawned by the test thread. For long-lived threads, such as AWT event dispatch thread, I will also try to figure out something (I'll timestamp all print events, so it should be possible to figure out roughly which test printed things in the AWT thread). The output capturing is at the top of my TODO list, so I will have it implemented after a couple of productive afternoons when I have time to work on it. Soon after that I'll make the first alpha release. I've looked a bit at how to integrate Jumi with maven-surefire. Jumi and Surefire have some overlap, for example both of them take care of classloading and starting a JVM process. One option is to use Surefire's classloading and use only the core runner parts of Jumi. Otherwise Jumi would need information that what are the dependency JARs, what are the current project's classes, maybe also that which of them are test and production classes (Jumi will do caching of the dependencies' class loaders to speed up the tests). That would require changes to Surefire, or then a completely new Maven plugin. kristian@... wrote on 4.1.2012 8:51: -- Esko Luontola www.orfjackal.net</body>

I read the discussion you mentioned in your post. Annotation-based approach seems to add another layer of complexity to me; whether this would be useful in practice I have no idea. In my experience all tests are somehow connected to a concrete method in some way (this is true even for generative runners like the parameterized runner).

    <header>Re: Open up Description class to allow arbitrary test hierarchies?</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm interested in this, though for slightly different reasons, maybe we could exchange ideas on this. I haven't exactly thought this through in detail, but I think my requirements come down to being able to store arbitrary information in a Description, a key. I'm interesting in testing with Scala, and there are (at least) two generic problems: 1) Tests which are not linked to a specific method, but are run as separate tests. Scalatest for example allows the following @RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner]) This creates a single method with the two tests within. However, the JUnitRunner runs the single method but records the two tests separately. This can be seen in Eclipse, see attached scalatest1.png. Now if I double click on the test name in the junit view, it tries to find a method of that name, and fails. Obviously, to correct this would require a fix to Eclipse, but if I could store the file &amp;amp; line number instead of the method name, I could jump to the appropriate line. 2) Scala allows spaces and other characters in method names, but these names are munged on compilation. For instance, space gets translated to $0020. Here the jump to in Eclipse works correctly, but the displayed description in Eclipse isn't nice, see scalatest2.png. So in both cases, the string I would like to display (in Eclipse, surefire whatever) doesn't match the method name, either because there is no method name or because It's not the same thing. I think that I could work around most issues is Eclipse etc if the test runner could add some arbitrary information to the description, which it could subsequently use. A string would be fine, because I could define the contents of that String, but arbitrary data would be even better. String would be simpler for everyone I think. Please note that I'm just thinking aloud at the minute, and I haven't actually done any proof of concepts as yet, but if you have any ideas, please feel free to take this to email.

    <header>Re: Open up Description class to allow arbitrary test hierarchies?</header>
    <body>I think your reasons are aligned with mine -- the problem is that a test's visual description for the user interface and where it "points to" should be separate things. My thoughts on the subject so far are that Description should provide a String with the human description and some sort of an (empty) interface, let's call it a TestSource which would provide additional hints which resource to open and where. So something like this (ideas, not implementation): I can think of numerous advantages of such an approach, for example a single parameterized test could open the test case's source code by returning: but it could also point to the file with parameterized test data and open _that_ as well, as in: Not giving much thought about the implementation, but you get the idea. Obviously this would be a major pain for all tools that use JUnit because this would pretty much break backwards compatibility... but I'm all for it if a new major revision of JUnit is to ever see the light of day. Temporarily, and interestingly, Eclipse (and Ant and other tools I think) can be cheated a bit -- they all use a JUnit version provided by the user's classpath via reflective access typically (they don't have fixed version dependency). If you "classpath-shadow" your JUnit's Description (by prepending classpath with your own Description class, keeping the same API) you can do anything you with with the descriptions... This is a dirty hack though :( Dawid</body>

    <body>Hi Bill, I did the JUnit integration for Scala-IDE, so yes I would like to be involved. Currently Scala-IDE uses the Junit plugin for running and displaying the test results, and it would obviously be better if we could avoid forking that. But for instance the jump to method doesn't work for FlatSpec stuff, and will never work because it's trying to find a method called xxx where xxx is the first word in the description of the test. Which obviously will never work. For Scala-IDE we can work around this using aspects, but it would be nice it this worked nicely. Hence my interest in changing Description. Matthew.

It's perfectly fine to add optional properties to the existing Description class, as long as Description.equals() and Description.hashCode() are updated, and all of the properties that are added have equals() methods that obey the general contract of Object.equals(). -- Kevin</body>

    <body>Hi, Is it possible to customize the "got ..." message when writing custom Matchers? I found this message in the Archives:  which talks about a describeMismatch method but I don't see in the javadocs for the Matcher or SelfDescribing interfaces. Am I missing something? Thanks, Jason</body>

    <header>Reporting on test runs from a custom Runner</header>
    <body>Hi everyone, I've created a custom Runner meant to help with performance and scalability testing. It lets you create tests like this: @RunWith(PerfRunner.class) In the above example, my runner calls demonstrationTest() 100 times, with parameter values (1, 100000), (2, 100000), ... (1, 200000), ... (10, 1000000). What I want to do now is produce charts of how long each call took. There are a lot of approaches, but I don't know which is "right." 1. Register a TestListener and write my own reports to disk from it (but is there a generic way to register listeners?) 2. Create my own main program that runs the test suite, and have it create the report when the suite is done (maybe this is the only way to register a TestListener anyhow?) 3. Transform the XML output of the ant junit task (but then it's bound to Ant) 4. Transform the XML output of the maven-surefure-plugin (but then it's bound to Maven) 5. Write performance results to disk directly from my TestRunner (should work in any environment, but feels like a dirty approach) Other ideas are welcome too, of course. My test runner is open source and published on GitHub; I want a solution that can work for everyone. So I think ideas 3 and 4 are out. Has anyone else thought about getting data from custom test runners into human-readable reports? -Jonathan</body>

    <body>Hi! Just my 2 cents: - an ant-script could still be used in maven (it has plugins for that purpose). It may need a bit of tinkering - I'm not very good in maven and ant. - Code injection via AspectJ could work well. Place a cutpoint on the method looping over the test again and again and measure the time before and after. Cheers, Georg testing.

    <body>Salut, The best way would be to create your own RunListener (btw TestListener is JUnit3, RunListener is Junit4). Then, you can plug this into standard tools. For instance, in maven surefire, you can specify: I think you can do similar things with ant. So if you do 1, 3 and 4 aren't a problem. Cordialement, Matthew Farwell.

    <body>Thanks for the pointer, Dawid. I have to admit I didn't find JUnitBenchmarks in my searches. I went looking for something back in September and again earier this week and came up empty. As far as what I'm trying to accomplish, it's kind of two things. First, I want to microbenchmark the performance of some internal data structures we're experimenting with for a web framework. I need to vary more than one parameter for these tests: number of threads allowed, number of messages to send through it, size of those messages, timing of the messages, and more. A single test method is likely to run thousands of times and produce multiple 2D charts worth of data. It looks like Google Caliper (thanks for that pointer too!) may be well suited to this task. Second, I want to run end-to-end scalability tests in various Java EE 6 containers. These tests will have many of the same variables. For these tests, I think Caliper is out. We're going to need Arquillian to wrangle all the server setup and teardown work. Arquillian is a JUnit 4 test runner too--I haven't thought through how to reconcile my test runner with Arquillian's, but I work on the same team as the Arquillian guys, and I'm hoping we can figure something out. It will probably involve pointing Arquillian at my test runner, or vice-versa. Thank you once again for the responses. I really appreciate it! Cheers, -Jonathan</body>

    <header>Test names and Parmaterized</header>
    <body>This has probably come up before.  Please forgive me for I failed to find an answer. I'm using @RunWith(Parameterized.class) and want to have test names other than foo[int]. foo[int] isn't very helpful e.g. in Jenkins logs. Is there a way for the test to specify the name it should be known by? For now, I've taken the Parameterized source code and modified it so that if the test class has a getTestName() method the runner will call that to get the test name.  This is currently working and I'd be happy to share. However, I did have to bodge things more than I like to get it to work.  If I do the straightforward change, then the framework asks for the test name from the runner before the test object is created.  I'm currently dealing with this by creating the test object when the test runner is created, i.e. in the constructor of the test runner and keeping it around for the lifetime of the test runner.  This works - but may violate some design assumptions I don't know about and means that any exception that can be thrown creating a test object can cause an initialization exception. I think this is useful functionality - I know of others who have also wanted something like this.  There are suggestions on StackOverflow for example to use the first parameter of a parameterset as the test name.  I think letting the test specify a getTestName method and defaulting to the current mechanism if there isn't one is better as its more backward compatible and gives the test developer more control. So: parameterized tests? so that the test object is created before the test name is requested? bwm</body>

    <header>Re: Testing individual test cases from command line.</header>
    <body>David, Thanks very much for your suggestions. I got it sorted out which as you pointed out was a case of copying some build directories to another location which would then enable the classes to be added to the classpath and executed from the command line. Thanks again Lewis larger vision of improving code integrity as well as expanding our testing activities. Before I begin writing the tests I have been working (frustratingly) on this particular Jira issue [1]. In summary, the issue attempts to add the functionality to a script [2] that will enable us to test individual test cases from the command line rather than have to run every JUnit test case when we wish to review changes or review performance of new test cases. I am however not getting very far with setting the correct environment variable and could do with some guidance. The patch which I'm trying to apply would allow us to run problem is the export classpath environment variable which should point to the test case directory. I'm just not able to add the class  paths, therefore I get an exception and stack trace error (NoClassDef) whenever I try to run a test case. progress with writing and fixing some 20-30 test classes. If I can provide any more information please advise.</body>

    <header>JUnit 4.10 is released</header>
    <body>All, JUnit 4.10 has been released.  It fixes a bug in packaging that affected maven users who use up-to-date versions of hamcrest.  Thanks to the efforts of a full cast of contributors, it also contains a couple dozen new features and bugfixes. The github model is working well as a way of maintaining JUnit as a community.  If you've been waiting to jump in and fix that bug, now may be the time. As usual, you can download directly from  should already be up at Maven Central, assuming I've done it right this time. Release notes are at  and copied below. Thanks all, and keep it green, ## Summary of Changes in version 4.10 ## Thanks to a full cast of contributors of bug fixes and new features. A full summary of commits between 4.9 and 4.10 is on [github]( ### junit-dep has correct contents ### junit-dep-4.9.jar incorrectly contained hamcrest classes, which could lead to version conflicts in projects that depend on hamcrest directly.  This is fixed in 4.10 [@dsaff, closing gh-309] ### RuleChain ### The RuleChain rule allows ordering of TestRules: writes the log ### TemporaryFolder ### - `TemporaryFolder#newFolder(String... folderNames)` creates recursively deep temporary folders - `TemporaryFolder#newFile()` creates a randomly named new file, and `#newFolder()` creates a randomly named new folder ### Theories ### The `Theories` runner does not anticipate theory parameters that have generic types, as reported by github#64.  Fixing this won't happen until `Theories` is moved to junit-contrib. In anticipation of this, 4.9.1 adds some of the necessary machinery to the runner classes, and deprecates a method that only the `Theories` runner uses, `FrameworkMethod`#producesType(). The Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included in the source repository. Thanks to `@pholser` for identifying a potential resolution for github#64 and initiating work on it. ### Bug fixes ### - Built-in Rules implementations directory if applying the rule fails AssumptionViolatedExceptions - Javadoc bugs - Miscellaneous junit.tests.framework.TestListenerTest [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-225] message [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-318] [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-42] ### Minor changes ### - Description, Result and Failure are Serializable [@ephox-rob, closing gh-101] - FailOnTimeout is reusable, allowing for retrying Rules [@stefanbirkner, closing gh-265] - New `ErrorCollector.checkThat` overload, that allows you to specify a reason [@drothmaler, closing gh-300]</body>

    <header>Overhauling exisiting JUnit tests</header>
    <body>Hi list, I'm attempting to overhaul our test source as per this Jira issue [1] and sub-issues. When looking at one existing test class [2] I see that instead of extending TestCase the case extends AbstractNutchTest. Apart from my initial thoughts that this was a previously used testing mechanism, I am pretty convinced that this has now been deprecated in favour of JUnit 4.5 test cases. This can also be seen in [3], which you will notice is also failing as documented in [1]. Further to this, I notice that there are a number of parameters that cannot be resolved e.g. in the case of TestInjector, testDir as shown below. This is consistent across 'all' four of the test cases I am trying to fix. I wonder if anyone can point me in the right direction to getting the configuration correct and getting these test cases working again. lewis@lewis-01:~/ASF/nutchgora/runtime/local$ bin/nutch junit org.apache.nutch.crawl.TestInjector .E Time: 0.003 There was 1 error: 1) testInject(org.apache.nutch.crawl.TestInjector)java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: testdir cannot be resolved at org.apache.nutch.crawl.TestInjector.setUp(TestInjector.java:57) FAILURES!!!

    <body>Hi, I have a pretty significant update on this issue. My understanding of our existing test infrastructure was not sufficient enough and in my initial post I've provided a somewhat inaccurate description of the problem I'm trying to address. The AbstractNutchTest is in full use and does an excellent job of extending TestCase to provide a platform for many other tests to build from. The test case I have identified as being pretty hectic is TestGoraStorage [1]. The initial thing I found puzzling about this test case is that, if run as a java application without any arguments, it passes a usage message "Usage: TestGoraStore &amp;lt;id&amp;gt; &amp;lt;startKey&amp;gt; &amp;lt;numRecords&amp;gt;". I've never experienced anything like this is any previous JUnit test cases, can anyone explain this to me please? The errors I'm getting when I run the test class can be seen here [2]. I understand that the errors might not be JUnit specific, however if I was able to get a bit of guidance as to the nature of the test etc then it would be more than helpful.

    <header>Re: Re: Test names and Parmaterized</header>
    <body>The essential idea is to make the ideas in Parameterized and Theories accessible without requiring custom runners, using something like Rules.  Call it, perhaps, a DataRule. The difference is that a Rule is a function that takes a Statement (what JUnit was going to do), and returns another Statement (what JUnit should do additionally/instead). A DataRule would take a Method, and return an (optionally empty) set of Statements. There's a lot of details to get right in the meantime: - Is it meaningful to have multiple DataRules? - How can DataRules override validation rules? - Should a DataRule be given the testcase object, or an API for constructing it? what you're doing?</body>

    <header>Logging start and end of tests &amp;amp; global rules</header>
    <body>Hi guys, A few years ago we have started using ClasspathSuite as our runner and we have modified it to suit our needs. One of the things that we do is logging for every test: - before the first setup (@Before method) or class setup (@BeforeClass method) is run - just before running the actual test method - right after running the actual test method - after the last teardown (@After method) or class teardown (@AfterClass method) is run This way for example, when we run a suite in a build node, we know exactly which logging statements belong to which test or if they happen in a setup. It's quite useful for debugging purposes when some tests break on a specific node. We rely on some deprecated code in order to do that, like BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.withBefores. So we were wondering if we can reimplement it with rules. It seems that the only way would be to retrofit every base test class and isolated test case class with the necessary rules. Is that correct? Or have some sort of global rules been implemented that apply for all tests? Thanks a lo Giuliano</body>

Call it MyRunListener 2) Create your own ClasspathSuite that overrides run like this: There's not an off-the-shelf way to add rules to a bunch of tests, but in this case, your use case is closer to listening than modification.

I imagined this being useful if, for example, the parameter data was loaded from lines in a file. However, I'm not aware of anyone who's actually used this facility.

For example, we use customized JButtons in the toolbar to display drop-down menus, which works fine with FEST on Windows but there's this little extra part for Mac... @RunsInEDT which eventually results in an endless loop as FEST attempts to walk the component tree looking for a JMenu/Item parent - which it never finds in the case of our JButtons.</body>

    <header>Open up Description class to allow arbitrary test hierarchies?</header>
    <body>Hi everyone. My name is Dawid Weiss, I'm a committer to Apache Lucene/Solr. Lucene and Solr use a custom runner to randomize test execution extensively. This works great and I've decided to try to pull a custom JUnit runner out of Lucene so that it can be reused without relying on the rest of Lucene's infrastructure. So... I wrote a custom runner and on the way I came across a problem: I would really like to have a hierarchy of Descriptions to indicate something meaningful, in particular contain the random seed for a suite group, then for individual tests, etc. I believe a similar situation could also be useful for ParameterizedRunner... Unfortunately, the problem is that Description is sealed and does not allow much in terms of flexibility (the constructor is private, static factory methods). The design of this class leads me to believe that Description should be a contract (interface or a class, but with the possibility of subclassing) so that getDisplayName() returns something meaningful (as in the example above), but getTestClass(), getMethodName() and getClassName() can still point IDEs and report writers to the right place. Or at least allow a custom display name not related to the method name/ class of the test case? Another burning issue we have in Lucene is that Assume.* methods don't take any explanation message. Why is this so? I mean: an assumption can fail, but just like with failures it'd be nice to be actually able to explain why a given assumption wasn't met... Let me know what you think. I can provide a patch (several ones :), but I wanted to hear what people think first. Dawid</body>

    <header>Re: Open up Description class to allow arbitrary test hierarchies?</header>
    <body>Dawid, The design of Description has several challenges, and I welcome the chance to move towards a better solution.  I think that getTestClass(), getMethodName() and getClassName() are currently implemented wrong: see for how I'd rather approach it.  In short, I'd like for Description to remain a serializeable, final, value class, but allow for custom Runners to have full control over what data gets put into that value structure.  Would that work for you?  If so, want to produce a patch for this? Separate from this are the problems that arise from Description containing both the test structure graph, and the metadata for each node in that graph, but that doesn't seem to be your current challenge. On the subject of error messages for Assume.*:  Oops.  :-)  Patches definitely welcome.</body>

    <header>Re: Alphabetizing test method run order?</header>
    <body>Very nice observations Kevin. The first thing that I needed to learn was how to enforce the same execution order as on the test machines, when Jesse changed the NetBeans tests to run in a-z ordering. Indeed this required Ant build script specific knowledge (in our case). I agree with you, that this is a kind of knowledge JUnit project does not want to impose on its users. Your idea of using hashCode is an excellent one. It is going to be stable on the same JDK and it is random enough for anyone to depend on the order. This might balance Kent's rationalistic wish for tests to have no dependencies among each other and pragmatic need of reproducibility in case they accidentally have. Let's base the (default) execution order on hashCode of methods! -jt PS: I like the idea of 24h fixed random seed! It mitigates many of the above problems, if developers are not lazy. Still, it should not be the default, as far as I can say.</body>

    <header>Re: Result and testAssumptionFailure handling</header>
    <body>So, it would be up to individual runners to figure out how to fit into the overall scheme.  Right now, the Theories runner doesn't report up individual assumption failures.  If every single data point results in an assumption failure, then the test is marked as failing.  If at least one data point fails, the test is marked as failing.  If at least one data point succeeds, and none fail, it's marked passing.

    <header>Re: Result and testAssumptionFailure handling</header>
    <body>Perhaps of interest is that we (the QA devs where I work) use a custom runner that slightly alters this behavior of Theories: if all of a Theory's assumptions fail, then we mark the test as skipped (as opposed to failed). This brings the semantics of the assume*() methods in the context of a @Test's and @Theory's much closer. (Background: this custom runner is used in a Selenium/WebDriver setup that is meant to test the UI of a system, irrespective of the system's underlying config/database. As such it is not uncommon that no suitable PotentialAssignments can be found for a given test setup. Yes, I am aware that this kind of test is anything but a unit test, but JUnit serves us very well regardless.)

    <header>Re: Alphabetizing test method run order?</header>
    <body>+10. I think this is a very good point. The ordering absolutely needs to be deterministic by default, so any problems are reproducible easily. I do use the ordering of junit tests, not because the tests are inter-dependent, but simply because I have slow tests and fast tests. I use junit for integration tests, so I run a batch from junit, and look at the results of the batch. Some tests have small datasets (10-15 seconds) and some have large datasets (10 minutes). I put the small ones first so I can either stop the test if the first fails, or do something else for ten minutes. If I have to run these tests using a different Runner, then that's fine, but I would rather not have to change anything (major). I would suggest we use the principle of least surprise here. If the hashCode is used as an ordering, yes it is deterministic, but it will seem random. If you use the test name, it is less surprising. People are used to tests being run in bytecode order. If you change the order then at least change it so that if people have problems due to ordering they can easily change the order. Yes, I know that their tests are broken, but they probably do too. If the order is based upon the hashCode, I have to either run that test with a custom Runner (and make sure that it's usable in Eclipse, Jenkins, maven, etc. etc.)[*]. If the order is simply the name, then all I have to do to 'fix' my problem is change the name. Matthew Farwell. [*] Or change the hashCode. For instance, I could have two tests: public void testStuff() public void testMoreStuff() These run in order as above. If the hashCode were used to order them, then we get testMoreStuff() then testStuff(). So to keep the original order we have to change testMoreStuff to testMoreStuffTextToIncreaseHashCode() :-)</body>

    <body>OK, All of this has convinced me that we have a fairly well-understood set of three statuses, and there's a definite drop-off in usefulness-per-unit-complexity beyond that.  So, back to the original question, Stefan: yes, I think we should increase the ignored tests count for an assumption failure. And Stephan, I'm definitely glad you've found it useful to implement different Theory semantics in a different Runner; I don't think there's a strong right-or-wrong about how to handle that particular case. that slightly alters this behavior of Theories: if all of a Theory's assumptions fail, then we mark the test as skipped (as opposed to failed).

    <header>JUnit 4.10: first beta snapshot</header>
    <body>All, I've pushed the first snapshot beta version of JUnit 4.10 to sonatype. Many thanks to a bright constellation of contributors.  Perhaps most notably, this release should fix the junit-dep jar contents issues that plagued maven users after the 4.9 release.  Combined release notes and acknowledgements are copied below. Maven users, to use this version, you'll need to add a dependency and repository in your pom.xml: Non-maven users, I didn't hear from any of you as potential beta testers, but I'm happy to support you if you speak up! If no regression errors are found over the next week, we will be pushing this as 4.10 final Share and Enjoy, ## Summary of Changes in version 4.10 [unreleased!] ## A full summary of commits between 4.9 and 4.10 is on [github]( ### junit-dep has correct contents ### junit-dep-4.9.jar incorrectly contained hamcrest classes, which could lead to version conflicts in projects that depend on hamcrest directly.  This is fixed in 4.10 [@dsaff, closing gh-309] ### RuleChain ### The RuleChain rule allows ordering of TestRules: writes the log ### TemporaryFolder ### - `TemporaryFolder#newFolder(String... folderNames)` creates recursively deep temporary folders - `TemporaryFolder#newFile()` creates a randomly named new file, and `#newFolder()` creates a randomly named new folder ### Theories ### The `Theories` runner does not anticipate theory parameters that have generic types, as reported by github#64.  Fixing this won't happen until `Theories` is moved to junit-contrib. In anticipation of this, 4.9.1 adds some of the necessary machinery to the runner classes, and deprecates a method that only the `Theories` runner uses, `FrameworkMethod`#producesType(). The Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included in the source repository. Thanks to `@pholser` for identifying a potential resolution for github#64 and initiating work on it. ### Bug fixes ### - Built-in Rules implementations directory if applying the rule fails AssumptionViolatedExceptions - Javadoc bugs - Miscellaneous junit.tests.framework.TestListenerTest [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-225] message [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-318] [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-42] ### Minor changes ### - Description, Result and Failure are Serializable [@ephox-rob, closing gh-101] - FailOnTimeout is reusable, allowing for retrying Rules [@stefanbirkner, closing gh-265] - New `ErrorCollector.checkThat` overload, that allows you to specify a reason [@drothmaler, closing gh-300]</body>

    <body>Hi Shaun, You're calling methods that are described as not threadsafe. That is, while your method is running on one thread, some other thread (the Swing "event" thread) might come along and fiddle with the same component you're fiddling with. I wonder if that's part of the problem. If it is, the way to solve the problem is to invoke the non-threadsafe methods via SwingUtilities.invokeLater() or SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait().  okeLater Dale JUnit testcase, it works.

    <body>Hi Shaun, I think Dale is right. I've done a fair share of Swing-JUnit-Tests and your code ought not work. The usual JUnit-Runner will run the tests in a "normal" Thread, while UI-Manipulation, including Frame creation, should be done in the AWT Eventqueue, even in a test. Also, if you interact with your GUI you need to wait for the events that you dispatch to be processed. Abbot, a ui test framework like FEST, provides a wait() method for that, which uses the invokeAndWait()-Method mentioned by Dale with an empty Runnable. regards murat  okeLater</body>

Before I begin writing the tests I have been working (frustratingly) on this particular Jira issue [1]. In summary, the issue attempts to add the functionality to a script [2] that will enable us to test individual test cases from the command line rather than have to run every JUnit test case when we wish to review changes or review performance of new test cases. I am however not getting very far with setting the correct environment variable and could do with some guidance. The patch which I'm trying to apply would allow us to run bin/nutch junit org.apache.nutch.testCase This would then run the specified test case class. I'm positive that my problem is the export classpath environment variable which should point to the test case directory. I'm just not able to add the class  paths, therefore I get an exception and stack trace error (NoClassDef) whenever I try to run a test case. Finally, just to clarify, I'm using the TestRunner class to run the tests. Any help, guidance etc would be greatly appreciated as it will enable me to progress with writing and fixing some 20-30 test classes. If I can provide any more information please advise.

    <header>Re: Result and testAssumptionFailure handling</header>
    <body>Works for me, however... It's also been proposed (I think as an analogy to NUnit, and maybe TestNG) that there should be four categories of test reports: - PASSED - FAILED - IGNORED: The user asked the framework not to run this test. - ABORTED: The user asked the framework to run this test, but the framework couldn't. The difference between IGNORED and ABORTED would be that the user shouldn't be surprised by IGNORED tests (the user took an action, like adding an @Ignore annotation, that caused the framework to skip the test).  However, an ABORTED test might be a surprise to the user: the test assumes that it is connected to the network, and that assumption failed. Splitting out these states might allow tools depending on the test runs to take different actions based on the different results.  For example, ABORTED tests might be treated similarly to IGNORED tests during development, but would prevent check-in or deployment. This raises three very different questions: (1) Should we have these 4 states, or stick with our current 3? (2) If we choose to have 4 states, what's the best name for the new state? (3) Are assumption failures, by default, to be treated as IGNORED, or ABORTED? It might be good to get these decisions made, and move on. corresponding method is empty and there's a comment: // do nothing: same as passing (for 4.5; may change in 4.6) It's because Result doesn't provide any information, that a test is ignored because of a failing assumption.</body>

    <header>Alphabetizing test method run order?</header>
    <body>All,  specification of the order in which test methods are selected to run within a test class using the default runner.  In the past, although under-documented, the policy has been that the order in which test methods within a test class are run is undefined.  In practice, it has been left to the JDK implementation, which has usually ended up meaning the tests are run in bytecode order, and almost always been a stable ordering. JDK 7 (and, I believe, upcoming releases of JDK 6) changes this, by having the methods returned from reflective queries in essentially random order. It will always be my belief that proper use of JUnit results in test methods whose passing or failure does not depend on ordering.  That said, it can be very frustrating to have a test break because the JDK selected a particular random ordering, and then have little or no tool support in recreating the order that triggers the failure. So, accepting this patch will mean that the ordering of methods will no longer change from run to run, even if you change or upgrade JDKs. Unfortunately, it may change the ordering once--if we put this change into 4.11, say, then teams using current versions of JDK 6 that upgrade from 4.10 to 4.11 may find their tests now running in a different stable ordering than before.  I think this is a small price as a one-time cost. More disconcerting to me would be if I started seeing test cases with method names like aaaRunMeFirst. Thoughts?</body>

    <body>At present if you create a Request, the tests will be unsorted, but you can call to have the tests sorted. Additionally, a Runner has the ability to sort its tests initially, though IMHO there is a tad missing in terms of sorting if your Runner extends from ParentRunner as the entire list of tests is hidden from the Sortable interface and child classes of ParentRunner... thus you are relying on Collections.sort to establish your sorting with the comparator. i.e. Some sorting requirements may need as many as N*N/2 comparisons to establish the correct sorting, while Collections.sort will typically only perform N*log(N) comparisons.

    <header>Re: Result and testAssumptionFailure handling</header>
    <body>The underlying problem with trying to come up with a fixed set of results is that we want to categorize tests on several axes... 1. Whether the test was or was not run. 2. Whether the test proved what it's designed to prove or not. 3. Whether the result is "good" or "bad" - or maybe "partly good" As far as I can see, the three axes are equatable only when a test passes - a passing test is "good" and was executed. Some combinations I can think of: not run + good: We didn't intend the test to run not run + bad: The test is poorly formed (but in a way that allows it to compile) not run + "kind of bad": The test is marked to be ignored (that's my interpretation anyway) run + bad: An assertion failed or an unexpected exception was thrown run + good: The test succeeded as designed run + neither good nor bad: The test failed an assumption There are lots of other possibilities and I imagine folks coming up with more that I can't preview. This has led me (in my own work) to move from an enumeration to an object in representing the result of a test. That object knows where it falls on each of the three axes. It bothers me that I have had to introduce this added complexity, but I'm fairly well convinced that it arises intrinsically from the problems I'm trying to solve. Whether that's the direction JUnit want's to go is, of course, an open question. Charlie On Tue, Sep 20, 2011 at 1:51 AM, Neale Upstone</body>

    <header>Re: Alphabetizing test method run order?</header>
    <body>-10 A number of projects I worked on used to do this. While this may initially seem like a good idea, it was problematic for us for a number of reasons. If the tests are run in a random order, then a small change to a test or a class under test could cause a completely unrelated test to fail. Many developers will assume that it is their change that caused the problem, leading them in a wild goose chase trying to see which of their changes caused the problems and why, and when they realize it is due to the test ordering, they need to do a big context switch back to their original task. This would be made worse by the fact that simply rerunning the tests would cause them to pass again (or worse, cause a different test to fail). Note that I don't think developers should be writing tests where the outcome depends on the ordering that the test methods were run. I just don't think we should assume that fixing the tests with this problem is necessarily as important as what the developer is trying to do. Making the test order random by default also does not necessarily make it easier to track down problems with ordering of tests, since if you ran the failing test suite again, you would get a different run order. JUnit could print out the random seed used for that particular run, but then developers would have to figure out how to pass the previous random seed back to the test (how to do this would depend on which IDE or build system they used). If developers want the ordering to be shuffled, they should use a custom runner that shuffles the tests. We used to do this in our JUnit3 tests with a custom subclass of TestSuite. It used a random seed based on the System.currentTimeMillis() at midnight, so if a particular ordering caused the tests to fail, it was reproducible for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, developers often assumed that the breakage was caused by one of the changes submitted since the most recent green run of the continuous build. Personally, I don't need the test ordering to be defined, but I need it to be deterministic. If I build the same code with the same JDK and run it in the same JRE on the same kernel on a different day, the tests should run in the same order. We often re-run tests that failed earlier in the day, using the same source code, to try to determine which failures were due to flaky tests. Having the tests run in a different order would make it much more difficult to do this analysis. I suggest that JUnit4 order the tests by the hash code of the test method name. If there is a tie, JUnit could compare the test names using the natural ordering defined by String.compareTo(String) (possibly in reverse :-) -- Kevin In that way, people would be urged to create independent tests and if it</body>

    <header>Ongoing usefulness of acknowledgements.txt and bug fixes in release notes?</header>
    <body>All, To date, we've kept two pieces of documentary metadata along with JUnit: acknowledgements.txt and ReleaseNotes files.  In order: 1) acknowledgements.txt is an attempt at a log of everyone outside of the primary maintainers who has contributed in some way to JUnit.  It was, I believe, originally intended to serve two purposes: (a) for traceability, should any legal questions arise about the provenance of a piece of code, (b) before github, we often ended up massaging (or replacing) patches ourselves before committing them to CVS, and we wanted a way to genuinely thank and remember the original authors. GitHub now helps with both of these issues: since we can discuss pull requests before they're accepted, we can ask contributors to fix minor issues, and github keeps excellent track of what came from where.  In addition, distributed maintenance of the acknowledgements.txt file has become a pain, since as a linear document, there is often a race condition between appended items. 2) I've been asking committers to include updates to ReleaseNotes files as part of check-ins.  This has some of the same issues as above: it's no longer strictly necessary given GitHub support, and also leads to race conditions. So, my proposal is: 1) Drop further appends to acknowedgements.txt 2) Adopt a more formal approach to git commit messages, following along along release notes to be largely auto-generated at release time.

    <body>Note: I have also posted this to junit-devel@... but I think that wider input could be beneficial Consider the case where you are testing a List class... we have  @Test  @Test  @Test  @Test We now want to add some tests of the delete functionality... but the reality is that until/unless some of the preceding tests are passing, the tests for delete are meaningless. We could have a perfectly functional List.delete() method but until such time as the above tests are passing, there is no way to tell that the method does not work. Now I could code my tests like such  @Test But all that I am doing is repeating code from the preceding tests, having changed all those tests' assertThat(...)s into assumeThat(...)s That does not seem agile to me, copy &amp;amp; paste &amp;amp; search &amp;amp; replace... ban code smell there I would much rather be able to annotate the tests with an @Assumes annotation that indicates that the test assumes that the specified tests are passing, e.g.  @Test  @Assumes("newListIsEmpty")  @Test In fact in my initial example of tests, there are some additional assumptions that I didn't make explicit  @Test  @Assumes("newListIsEmpty")    ... and  @Test    ... Now you could get some of this functionality via a TestRule... You could watch tests to see if they pass, and skip tests annotated with the annotation if assumed functionality is failing, but that would result in sporadic failures of, e.g. deleteRemovesAnElement because of the failing newListIsEmpty being executed _after_ deleteRemovesAnElement rather than before. The simple point is that the test result of deleteRemovesAnElement is meaningless until its assumptions are true, and while I could code the assumptions with assumeThat(..)s C&amp;amp;P&amp;amp;S&amp;amp;R is even worse than C&amp;amp;P. Another alternative to @Assumes would be to invoke the assumed method(s) at the start of the test, e.g.  @Test    newListIsEmpty(); // verify assumed functionality    addPutsAnElementIntoAnEmptyList();  // verify assumed functionality    ... That gets rid of the C&amp;amp;P&amp;amp;S&amp;amp;R, but there are two issues with that:  1. We have to manually invoke any setup/tearDown methods, including all those of the rules that the test class has... very messy  2. The test fails when the assumed test fails. In actuality we can say nothing at all about whether deleteRemovesAnElement if a newListIsEmpty is not passing... yes we could code the test differently, but that is just moving our assumptions somewhere else. I am sure that there are others out there who feel there is a point 3...  3. We already ran those tests why waste time running them again? Well the answer to 3 is that these are UNIT tests which should be very fast, so what is the harm... So, in my view, best practice unit testing needs the ability to mark tests as assuming that other tests are passing, so that those tests can be skipped when the assumptions are known to be failing or skipped. [This is a deliberately loaded criteria... if the org.junit.runner.Request does not include the assumed test, then that test is neither known failing or known skipped, so we can run the test and output a warning that the failure may be because of assumed functionality... the use case of executing one and only one test repeatedly until you get that test passing] The annotation would have implications on test sorting, as any assumed tests would have to always happen before the assuming tests (as long as the assumed tests are in the org.junit.runner.Request) Also might have to be two annotations, e.g. @Assumes(methodNames) @AssumesClasses(classes) though in my view the @AssumesClasses is less critical, as these are UNIT tests and each test class should be independent to a large extent. However I am willing to consider that some people may have many test classes for one class under test, one test class containing all the tests of the constructors, another testing the Add methods, etc. in which case an @AssumesClasses annotation makes sense.

The short answer is that no, we don't plan to support dependencies. If I have tests that are slow enough that I care about dependencies, my most productive option is generally to work on the design of the software until the tests are fast enough that I no longer care. That said, my voice is only one of many. The longer answer is that I encourage you to post your idea on the JUnit mailing list for community discussion. Regards, Kent</body>

Works fine run in Eclipse on Mac as an application or JUnit test but fails when run as JUnit plugin test. Frame would show 1 out of 5 or so times. Removing all unneeded plugins resulted in frame always being shown but the click never seems to happen. I also tried Window Licker and the included Calculator test(s) - same thing... runs as a JUnit Test but fails as a JUnit Plugin Test. One time the frame was shown, but nothing happened (so the test failed). The other times, the frame didn't even show. Tried removing all VM args and unnecessary plugins. Is this related to the args that Eclipse uses to run plugin tests on Mac? Or the core plugins included to run the tests? Or...? Shaun. testing and it works quite well on Windows. With or without FEST on the Mac, I can't seem to get any UI tests to run. The initial frame/window comes up in some cases but I can't do much more than that.

    <body>Hi Stephen and all, More like TestNG's "dependsOnMethods" feature. I understand your desire for this. I also understand the JUnit guys' reluctance to implement it. My intermediate-ish experience with TestNG leaves me with the conclusion that inter-test dependencies lead to madness. To be fair, I had already concluded that before working with clients who insisted on specifying inter-test dependencies. My first half-baked thought is to use a Rule to prevent running methods that depend on another method that has already failed. But that would work only if the tests were run in the appropriate order. So my next half-baked thought is to write a custom Runner that builds the dependency graph and sequences the tests accordingly. Then either the runner or a rule could decide whether to run a test. I'm confident that a runner could do what you want, but that requires delving into the arcane bits of JUnit. A final half-baked thought: What if you ran all the tests, then used the dependency graph only to mark the results somehow, so as to highlight the tests on which others depend. If you see a swarm of failures, and the display indicates that some common prerequisite test also failed, that would aid your investigation. I've seen situations where some prerequisite test fails, but some of the dependent tests pass. Sometimes the prerequisite test is lying to me (and I need to fix that). Sometimes the dependency is over-specified--the dependent test doesn't depend on everything that the prerequisite test tests (which means I need to refactor the prerequisite test and the dependency specifications). Sometimes it means that the prerequisite test fails intermittently (which means I need to track down the uncontrolled factors that affect the test).

    <header>Re: Feature request: @Assumes</header>
    <body>This is actually one of the main values of dependent tests: accurate reporting. Without dependencies, one test failing might result in "100 Failures", but when the testing framework knows your dependency graph, it will be "1 Failure, 99 Skips", which helps narrow down what's going on much faster. Another value is obviously with functional testing, so you avoid using mocks completely but you also don't spend your time recreating expensive state before each test method. And you're also testing the state created by your production code in the previous step, which is much more representative of what's actually going on. From what I can gather, dependent tests are also particularly useful for frameworks like Selenium, which need to test heavily dependent pathways ("Don't test this page if logging in failed", etc...). Anyway, different purposes. JUnit is for unit testing and you should most likely not use dependencies for that, but they are very useful for all the other kinds of tests. -- Cédric</body>

    <header>Re: Feature request: @Assumes</header>
    <body>Hi Dale, I think it's an overinterpretation to call this a dependency. The syntax merely says that the test makes an assumption. Given such an assumption, the framework might do a number of things, only one of which is to treat the connection as a dependency. In my own work - which of course is not junit-related - I'm looking ways to specify relations like this *without* calling for any specific behavior on the part of the framework. Of course, the "obvious" and perhaps simplest implementation is to run the "assumed" test first and skip the test using the assume in the case where it fails. But I like the idea that the user might express known or believed-to-be-true logical relations among tests while the framework would be free to make use of that information in ways not necessarily predictable by the user. As an example, imagine a framework that gave a message like "You stated that TestA assumes TestB but TestA passed even though TestB failed." Charlie</body>

    <body>A bit, but not completely. I see dependsOnMethods as being a hard restriction, i.e. stating that you must run the depended on method first. Assumes acts of more of a hint that you should run the assumed method first. also that a failure of the assumed method should imply a failure of the assuming method (so Assumes does not say that you must not run the assuming method is the assumed method is failing... in fact you could if the method with the Assumes passes when it's assumed methods fail, then that turns the pass into an InvalidAssumptionError ;-) ) reluctance to implement it. My intermediate-ish experience with TestNG leaves me with the conclusion that inter-test dependencies lead to madness. To be fair, I had already concluded that before working with clients who insisted on specifying inter-test dependencies.

Already implemented: Some notes about the above, the sorting is not perfect, perfect sorting would require a full bubble sort (i.e. resort until no changes are made) the sorting just makes a "best effort" to get tests that Assume after the tests the assume. If you assume a test that makes other assumptions, there are cases where the assuming test might run first... I see nothing wrong with that other than I currently don't see a mechanism to catch the failure and mark it as less critical if the later run assumed test also fails. dependency graph only to mark the results somehow, so as to highlight the tests on which others depend.

    <body>OK, I figured out what went wrong.*  It involved a subtle quirk in the ant script that was uploading to maven. How to make it right? (1) release a new junit-dep-4.9.jar with the correct contents, "on top of" the incorrect junit-dep-4.9.jar.  I'm not sure if the maven gatekeepers allow this, or whether it would be confusing for those downstream, but it's easy to do in a minute. (2) Call the fixed version 4.9.1.

    <body>In JUnit pre-4.9, MethodRule#apply() supplied the FrameworkMethod and the target object (the instance of the test class currently executing).

In 4.9, TestRule#apply() only gives us the Description object. Now, maybe I haven't looked hard enough but looking at the Description object alone I can't figure out how to get the instance of the current test.

    <body>I'd say that documentation is part of the product, and therefore should start in the same git repo as the Java sources, and be versioned with them. A simple approach would be to follow Mockito's approach, and make the Javadoc the full documentation (at least, I've never needed to look elsewhere). The process would then be a case generating the javadoc into the site repo on github, committing and publishing it. I think this should be as automated as possible.  JUnit is a bit off on it's founder's XP credentials, and part of that seems to be an allergy to Maven.  We should be able to release JUnit from a button on a build server :) junit.sourceforge.net and github. Additionally some information is missing or very hard to find (new features like rules, current version, how to contribute, ...) to find the information and JUnit would look more professional.

    <body>Yes.  This is a pain for me, as well. Sourceforge.net is purely vestigial.  The moment there's a great, authoritative master location to link to, I'll do what it takes to kill sourceforge and point it there. junit.org is an oddity.  For reasons that predate me and I only dimly understand, junit.org was registered back in 2000 by Object Mentor. To my knowledge, it has never been actively maintained by any of the active maintainers of the JUnit source.  The site currently there (developed by Ben Rady and a merry crew roughly four years ago) is one of the better incarnations of the site.  However, its design presupposed that the junit.org site itself would serve as an active community, and I think that never fully materialized, with this mailing list and, now, github, being the main points of vibrancy. To me, I think the ultimate solution would be a site accessible at   information available at the current junit.org site.  I'd have to talk to a couple of stakeholders to see if this can be made to happen. junit.sourceforge.net and github.

    <body>On Fri, Sep 9, 2011 at 5:49 AM, Neale Upstone I'm open to any and all improvements to the javadoc that add to discoverability of features.  Mockito is interesting, in that the release notes, how-to doc, etc., are baked directly into the javadoc. This didn't immediately appeal to me, because I've found that long-form text and code samples in javadoc are a pain to maintain, because of the interaction of HTML and Java syntaxes.  Do you know if the mockito team uses tooling that makes it easier? Yes.  Of the code I have personally written for JUnit over the last 8 months, easily over half has been automation of build, release, and documentation. To be fair, to my knowledge, no one's getting paid to work 40-hour weeks on JUnit, so other XP practices also have to bend.  :-) I'm not sure about allergy.  JUnit predates the first glimmer of maven by at least three years, and we've been fairly enthusiastic about community contributions to make working with JUnit and maven easier. Donations toward acquiring cycles happily accepted.  ;-) junit.sourceforge.net and github.

    <header>JUnit 4.9 released!</header>
    <body>Hello, everyone.  We're happy to announce the release of JUnit 4.9. This release's theme is Test-class and suite level Rules.  More information linked from  release notes below. Note: please remember that until some website issues are cleared up, the direct path to the new JavaDoc is at  Share and enjoy, and please try it out and give us feedback.  Thanks, Your friendly neighborhood JUnit maintainers ## Summary of Changes in version 4.9, final ## Release theme: Test-class and suite level Rules. ### ClassRule ### The `ClassRule` annotation extends the idea of method-level Rules, adding static fields that can affect the operation of a whole class.  Any subclass of `ParentRunner`, including the standard `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner` and `Suite` classes, will support `ClassRule`s. For example, here is a test suite that connects to a server once before all the test classes run, and disconnects after they are finished: @RunWith(Suite.class) @ClassRule @Override @Override ### TestRule ### In JUnit 4.9, fields that can be annotated with either `@Rule` or `@ClassRule` should be of type `TestRule`.  The old `MethodRule` type, which only made sense for method-level rules, will still work, but is deprecated. Most built-in Rules have been moved to the new type already, in a way that should be transparent to most users.  `TestWatchman` has been deprecated, and replaced by `TestWatcher`, which has the same functionality, but implements the new type. ### Maven support ### Maven bundles have, in the past, been uploaded by kind volunteers.  Starting with this release, the JUnit team is attempting to perform this task ourselves. ### LICENSE checked in ### The Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included in the source repository. ### Bug fixes ### - github#98: assumeTrue() does not work with expected exceptions - github#74: Categories + Parameterized - github#38: ParentRunner filters more than once - github#248: protected BlockJUnit4ClassRunner#rules method removed from 4.8.2 - github#187: Accidental dependency on Java 6 Thanks to `@kcooney` for: - github#163: Bad comparison failure message when using assertEquals(String, String) - github#227: ParentRunner now assumes that getChildren() returns a modifiable list ### Minor changes ### - Backed out unused folder "experimental-use-of-antunit", replaced by - Various Javadoc fixes Thanks to `@kcooney` for: - Made MultipleFailureException public, to assist extension writers. - github#240: Add "test" target to build.xml, for faster ant-driven testing. - github#247: Give InitializationError a useful message</body>

But if I do have a problem that needs a specific order, I think the trick to use a chaining Rule sounds like the best workaround I can think of right now. And that's what it is to me: A workaround. For example in my current project: We have a "registry" for dependency lookup. This needs to be initiated before some other things can happen. We don't currently have a Rules problem here, but I can imaging, that such a quirky design can lead to such problems. And then a workaround might be helpful.

    <body>Kent, I've seen several examples in the wild.  Easiest to explain is this: I have an ExternalResource that starts and stops an expensive server.  I also have a Timeout rule.  If the Timeout is applied around the ExternalResource, then I am asserting that server startup + test + server stopping all happens within the timeout.  If the ExternalResource is applied around the Timeout, then I am ignoring the server startup time, and just asserting about the test time. One possibility is to create specialized TimeoutExternalResource and ExternalResourceTimeout rules that bake-in the ordering.  I like the RuleChain approach better, because it encourages separation of concerns. and order-independent.

    <header>Re: Chaining of rules</header>
    <body>I agree with David. I am having the pretty much this scenario right now. I think it is related to rules doing fundamental different things: - doing setup/tear down work - doing runtime manipulation of the test execution, like executing it in parallel or in special thread (e.g. Swing EDT) - doing additional assertions like the mentioned Timeout Rule. If you have rules from different groups you need to control the order of things very often. Jens</body>

    <body>A challenge in this naming is that if I want this ordering: Rule A has control Rule B has control Test method has control Rule B has control Rule A has control Then "first" and "next" are somewhat ambiguous: - A is "first" in the sense that it gets control first - B is "first" in the sense that, as somewhat of an implementation detail, it is wrapped around the test before A is wrapped around B. Or perhaps if I didn't know the implementation, I would find only the first meaning interesting?

At first I had code like this: But since that didn't work quite right, I had to embed the TemporaryFolder inside AppRunner and manually wrap it around AppRunner's execution. BTW, it would be better for TemporaryFolder to throw an exception if its getRoot/newFile/newFolder method is called before create() is called. When I was using it incorrectly, my tests were polluting the current working directory with temporary files, because new File(null, fileName) produces a relative path.

Both rules work pretty for itself, but we could create a nice rule by combining the UserProviderRule and the ProductProviderRule.

    <body>murali, There is currently no even moderately easy way* to put something in a suite class that will cause a Rule to be applied to every method in every contained test class, which is what you appear to be doing.  If you're using JUnitCore, you should be able to use JUnitCore.addRunListener to get what you want, though.  Let me know if I've understood the problem right. * However, there is a way that you can write a subclass of Suite that _does_ enable this kind of functionality.  If someone wanted to write such a subclass, and submit it as a project in junit.contrib, I'd welcome it... FrameworkMethod using Rule. Is it possible to set a Rule to a suite which s running with the help of JUnitCore/textui.Thx in advance.!! working for me. Any help would be appreciated. e.getClass().getSimpleName()</body>

    <header>Re: Chaining of rules</header>
    <body>Back to naming, I think: 1) I like having the outermost rule first in the chain, because, among other reasons, if the ordering matters, it's because the inner rules are depending on the context provided by the outer rules, so outermost to innermost is the right conceptual ordering. 2) I like outerRule, or outermost, as the first method name.  I prefer "around" to "enclose", because the connotations are similar, but "around" will be familiar to users of Lisp's defadvice macro who are currently using JUnit (yes, both of us...) which is a rule itself: the inner rule:  b998c7</body>

    <header>Introductory JUnit questions</header>
    <body>Hello group, As a novice JUnit user (I tried it briefly 5 years ago but never got very far with it), I want to use it for a work project.  We code in the latest version of Java using NetBeans 6.9.1.  I was able to generate the test class: AngleTest) and had some questions just from playing around with it for a few minutes yesterday: 1. It seems that since NB has built-in JUnit support (i.e. Run File), I don't need to have an associated Main class under the Test Packages. True or false? 2. If I do decide to use a Main class as my test harness for my JUnit classes, I assume I have to declare an instance of the test class.  True or false? 3. Furthermore, if I were to instantiate the test class and run it under my Main, wouldn't I basically have to make a call to each test* method explicitly?  It seems like "Run File" does that for me. 4. I was able to just do "Run File" on AngleTest.java and it ran for me in a split screen window at the bottom of NB.  Kind of cool - gives me pass/fail and TTE (time to execute) stats.  I noticed, however, that everything failed because JUnit by default puts in some boilerplate lines of code: - a line to compare the actual result with the expected result of a method invocation (this only happens sometimes, not on all methods such as a void print()) - a call to assertEquals() on both operands to make sure they match - a comment that tells me to review the generated code and remove the default call to fail() - the call to fail() all of the time The main questions I have about this arrangement are: 5. Am I supposed to go ahead and customize the values and/or code in the auto-generated test methods to test what I want?  What's the better approach: Add more code for more test cases inside the method, or keep changing the existing code and re-running it until I'm satisfied with the test results? Here's an example method from AngleTest (testing the rad2deg() method): 6. If I deliberately set the result and expResult to be two different things and also remove the call to fail(), will assertEquals() take care of raising a flag saying, "Hey dummy, your results didn't match!"? 7. What happens if I set a value for the angle in degrees and make a call to something like setDegrees(value)?  How can that even fail anyway (i.e. what's the point of having the test method)? 8. If I just remove the auto-generated calls to fail() as the comment suggests, then how am I going to know if my test is failing or not? Essentially what I'm seeing is that I can rig the test however I want, which is not entirely what I'd like to happen. My class under test (CUT) Angle is just that: A class that stores different representations of angles (degrees and radians) for my project.  (Please don't suggest that I use any such existing class already out there...I write all my code from scratch for several reasons.) Thanks for your patience...I can't find any other current appropriate forum to ask these questions.  I want to take full advantage of JUnit's capabilities to help me write unit test cases. Mike P.S. I realize it would probably be helpful to attach both Angle.java and AngleTest.java.  If anyone has a suggestion for what to do about that, I'll gladly post them.

    <header>Mixing parameterized and non-parameterized tests in the same test class</header>
    <body>I have a situation where I'm using the Parameterized runner in a test class, where some of the tests are parameterized but others are not. Here is the test class in question. The test class is checking the dependencies and contents of the Maven artifacts produced by the build. I have some special build requirements which require me to use Maven Shade Plugin to bundle external (and in one case also internal) dependencies into the same JAR, and these build tests have been extremely helpful (more details at the first episodes of   end-to-end-tests/src/test/java/fi/jumi/test/BuildTest.java The first two tests are parameterized. They check each artifact for its expected dependencies and contents. The third test is checking one of the artifacts which was checked already earlier, but this time a copy the JAR which which is embedded inside another JAR (it's used in bootstrapping the application). Since this test is slow (~150ms), I want to avoid running it many times. Logically it's related to the things checked by the parameterized tests, so I want to keep it close to them, but it itself is not parameterized. Right now I've solved the issue with a hack, so all but one parameterized execution skip the test. The fourth and fifth test are tests against all of the parameters. It's testing the test data, to make sure that some project-wide principles are followed (i.e. no visible dependencies to external libraries). These tests also are not parameterized. Fortunately they are quick, so I haven't tried to avoid running them many times. What are your suggestions for mixing parameterized and non-parameterized tests? Some creative use of nested classes? I've been thinking about extending Parameterized so that I can annotate which methods are parameterized and which are not, by adding either @ParameterizedTest or @NonParameterized annotations to the test methods. The non-parameterized methods would be run only once, probably using the first element in the test data (passing null to the constructor is another option; now it would fail in the constructor, but I should anyways relocate the couple of method calls which are now in the constructor). -- Esko Luontola www.orfjackal.net</body>

    <header>Re: Introductory JUnit questions</header>
    <body>Michael wrote on 11.8.2011 18:17: True. Nearly every testing and building tool out there finds all tests automatically. In the main method you would use  give it a list of all test classes (or suites which contain the test classes). JUnit will create the test class instances itself (actually once per test method) and call the test methods. It's NetBeans (or whichever tool you used) that generates the boilerplate, not JUnit. The best approach would be to write all tests manually. That way you can write meaningful tests which describe the features of the system. See  Try it. (The answer should be yes.) It won't fail. There is no point in testing things such as trivial setters/getters (and language features such as the `new` operator). Those will be tested indirectly when you write tests for features which use them. Write tests for (all) things which could possibly fail. To find out whether a test works, modify the production code so that it has a bug in the feature which is being tested by the test. Good tests fail: An even better way is to write the tests before the production code. First the test will fail because the system doesn't yet do the thing which is specified by the test. Write code until the test passes. Remove duplication and fix bad names ( Repeat.

    <header>Re: Introductory JUnit questions</header>
    <body>What's a Main Class? I've never, ever used one ;-) No, you would bypass the main class, instantiate the specific class (Angle) directly and invoke methods on the instance. I don't use NB so I don't know how NB does it. Normally, JUnit calls the test method and the test method calls the method under test. No main involved anywhere. Just because some tool generated some code doesn't mean that the code is the right code; read an introductory book on writing unit tests, preferably using Test-Driven Development. Yes. You tell me! Your tests should specify what the software is supposed to do, not the other way around. See previous question. You would not need to ask all these questions if you had read the introductory tutorial on JUnit at least.. Just playing with the NB menu options doesn't teach you everything you need to know. Learning how to write good unit tests is something that will take more than a few minutes or hours. Best wishes, Gerard -- Gerard Meszaros 1-403-827-2967</body>

    <body>On the other hand it doesn't feel great to separate tests based on a technical concern of the test framework. What should I name the classes? XTest and XParameterizedTest? I'd much rather sort my tests into logical groups based on some behavioural aspect if I separate them at all, If the grouping is according to behavioral aspects the testclasses can be named accordingly. I have never used ParameterizedTestCase but I half expected that the parameters would be passed as parameters to each test in which case it would be easy to separate them from non parameterized ones. I can see that the constructor approach has some maintanability benefits though... I'm not too keen on the idea of different annotations either. I think that there is no uncomplicated natural way to describe how a non parameterized test in a parameterized testcase works. Perhaps a variant of the parameterized testrunner that passes the parameters as arguments to each test? /J ----------------------------------------------------- Joakim Ohlrogge Agical AB Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN Mobile: +46-708-754004 Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com Twitter: @johlrogge E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...  end-to-end-tests/src/test/java/fi/jumi/test/BuildTest.java</body>

With the success of Rules, I hope to find a good extension hook that will let us do for data-driven tests what Rules have done for fixture preparation, so that everyone can drive data through their tests in their own ways.

    <header>JUnit 4.9b4 (beta-)released</header>
    <body>Hello, everyone.  We're happy to announce the release of JUnit 4.9b4. This release's theme is Test-class and suite level Rules.  This beta release contains a number of community-authored fixes for regression errors in documentation and test class validation.  More information linked from  and release notes below.  Share and enjoy, and please try it out and give us feedback.  Thanks, Your friendly neighborhood JUnit maintainers ## Summary of Changes in version 4.9 [unreleased!] ## Release theme: Test-class and suite level Rules. ### ClassRule ### The `ClassRule` annotation extends the idea of method-level Rules, adding static fields that can affect the operation of a whole class.  Any subclass of `ParentRunner`, including the standard `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner` and `Suite` classes, will support `ClassRule`s. For example, here is a test suite that connects to a server once before all the test classes run, and disconnects after they are finished: @RunWith(Suite.class) @ClassRule @Override @Override ### TestRule ### In JUnit 4.9, fields that can be annotated with either `@Rule` or `@ClassRule` should be of type `TestRule`.  The old `MethodRule` type, which only made sense for method-level rules, will still work, but is deprecated. Most built-in Rules have been moved to the new type already, in a way that should be transparent to most users.  `TestWatchman` has been deprecated, and replaced by `TestWatcher`, which has the same functionality, but implements the new type. ### Maven support ### Maven bundles have, in the past, been uploaded by kind volunteers.  Starting with this release, the JUnit team is attempting to perform this task ourselves. ### LICENSE checked in ### The Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included in the source repository. ### Bug fixes ### - github#98: assumeTrue() does not work with expected exceptions - github#74: Categories + Parameterized - github#38: ParentRunner filters more than once - github#248: protected BlockJUnit4ClassRunner#rules method removed from 4.8.2 - github#187: Accidental dependency on Java 6 Thanks to `@kcooney` for: - github#163: Bad comparison failure message when using assertEquals(String, String) - github#227: ParentRunner now assumes that getChildren() returns a modifiable list ### Minor changes ### - Backed out unused folder "experimental-use-of-antunit", replaced by - Various Javadoc fixes Thanks to `@kcooney` for: - Made MultipleFailureException public, to assist extension writers. - github#240: Add "test" target to build.xml, for faster ant-driven testing. - github#247: Give InitializationError a useful message</body>

    <body>Gabriele, It's mostly as a guide for users.  JUnit doesn't do anything with the return value (for example, if you saw a test method returning boolean, you might reasonably assume that the method could fail by returning "false").  The added return line would in most cases be noise. While there have been proposals for allowing a return type, and doing something with it, none have yet reached the levels of general usefulness and obvious syntax that would merit a change.

    <header>Doubles Vs Floats Test</header>
    <body>Hello, I recently created and submitted a working patch for JUnit having to do with Assert.assertArrayEquals(float[],float[],delta) throwing exceptions with doubles instead of floats.

[1] This causes the issue that for example IDEA's test runner cannot report the test progress in real time - the tests are executed before the progress bar is even started. As a long-term solution I'm developing a new test runner [2] which solves this issue and has also a bunch of other improvements.

    <body>Jumi looks very interesting. It would be great with "one API to run them all and in darkness bind them" so to speak :) Basically talk to one API to get access to all the different test frameworks out there. I had an idea along those lines that focused on the other end sort of. To "just" be a rosetta stone, but not be the smallest common denominator between all test frameworks but rather embrace their differences. One of the big challenges was statuses and I think my thoughts were along the lines of RDF where one could express that things that "pending" is a kind of "ignored" for reporting purposes but differs in that it is yet to be implemented. Basically I approached things from the reporting side rather than the running side since most test frameworks seem to not want to deal with guis, ide integraton and such but focus on what a test looks like when it is written. When I read about Jumi I sort of hoped that Jumi could become this rosetta stone... but a more ambitious one. ----------------------------------------------------- Joakim Ohlrogge Agical AB Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN Mobile: +46-708-754004 Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com Twitter: @johlrogge E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...  csy/junit/SpecsyJUnitRunner.scala</body>

There are quite many different reasons for having a skipped/ignored/pending test, and also with some testing frameworks they are marked pending during the execution of the test (e.g. ScalaTest's pendingUntilFixed) whereas some mark them before executing any test code (e.g. JUnit's @Ignore). At first I'll create the simplest possible solution and have just one concept of skipped tests.

    <body>I think this is where my idea was different. I planned to delegate the running completely to other frameworks and just be flexible about what they can report back. So it becomes more of a presentation-issue (it seems to me that you are also focusing on running the tests, especially being clever about ordering the run sequence for high probability of catching failing tests fast). Being the requester for pending until fixed in scalatest I often miss the explicit pending in test-frameworks. The inspiration here is rspec. As you say, the difference between pending in this sense and just ignoring is that pending tests are run anyway but failures do not give a "red bar" since they are expected, it works well for "mockless to down" where you can flesh out tests from the top and pend until you can get something working. Once one of your initial tests work they change status from pending to fixed (or in scalatest, fail because a successful test is marked as pending) It also looks very promising with focus on performance. Have you looked into incremental running alá SBT or is that left to tools like SBT?

    <body>Joakim Ohlrogge wrote on 23.6.2011 11:48: Yes, I'm focusing on running the tests. From a testing framework's point of view, Jumi provides a similar interface as JUnit's @RunWith annotation and the related APIs. Jumi will also include things such as test discovery and starting up the JVM instance, which previously have been taken care of build tools and IDEs. There will also be a graphical UI, so that it would be usable even without IDE integration. My goal is to solve some cross-cutting concerns which affect the full tool chain of running tests. It will also try to minimize the small differences between running tests in a build tool vs IDE, and protect from the effects of bugs in IDEs' support for running tests (I've encountered many such issues). I know about SBT's incremental compiler. Does it also do something smart related running tests? SBT and FSC were my inspirations for class loader caching: Jumi will use a separate class loader for library JARs and cache it, so that when running tests there would not be the overhead of loading a large library's classes (for example on my C2Q6600 it takes over 200ms to load Guice the first time). With Java 6 and before, class loading is single threaded (Java 7 will have parallel classloading), so that has been a bottleneck for running tests in parallel. JUnit Max's way of reordering tests, so that those which fail the most likely are run first, is also one thing that I'll include. I have a habit of waiting for the tests to finish executing before typing more, so the UI will also give some feedback about when the most-likely-to-fail tests have been run, so that I could resume typing faster. And running tests in parallel is of course a must - finally some use for my 4 CPU cores. :) The above optimizations are especially aimed for speeding up test suites which run in a matter of seconds. If it takes 3 seconds to run all tests, a speedup of 0.5 seconds is big. I'll also provide something for big companies which are full of mediocre developers writing slow tests. Running tests in a cluster is outside the scope of Jumi's core functionality, but I'll create a commercial plugin for that. (Who wouldn't want to get a living from writing open source? ;) I'm not sure how much running tests in a cluster would speed up already fast test suites, because of network latency, but I'll try and see what I can do about it. -- Esko Luontola www.orfjackal.net</body>

Regarding SBT, there is the ~test-quick action that attempts to run only the tests relevant for what you have changed (my interpretation from using it, don't know /exactly/ how it optimizes). It seems SBT has quite excellent dependency analysis that allows for these kinds of features. Also, SBT's console really is such an obvious thing to do given hot spot optimizers etc so it's almost weird that maven, ant et al did not do this. Why wouldn't one keep the build/test-tool running? (given how long it takes to start a JVM and how much things can accelerate once the hotspot kicks in and does it's magic; usually several seconds into execution if I understand things correctly).

    <body>I'd encourage you to define a very clear separation between the static and dynamic model of your tests. Anything specified with an annotation (such as @Test(disabledUntilFixed = true)) is part of the static model. At runtime, a test that is "pending" is one that's in the worker pool but that hasn't been scheduled yet. TestNG supports skipped test in its static model (a skipped test method is a method that depends on another test that failed) but not in the runtime model, which I think is less interesting (maybe just for cute IDE progress display?). -- Cédric</body>

I've got an idea that while idling Jumi would analyze the classes and do experimental test runs. For example it's possible to find out what classes a test depends on by running that test in a fresh class loader and monitoring that which classes get loaded. Yes. The class loader caching has two benefits: 1. The overhead of class loading of external libraries goes away. This is expected to speed up the test run by hundreds of milliseconds - maybe even a couple of seconds if there are lots of big libraries being used. 2. The JVM's is able to do JIT optimizations on the external libraries, and they will persists between test runs. This should speed up consistently by some percentage. Application code's class loaders will need to be thrown away between test runs [1], so those won't benefit from this optimization. Though it might be possible to keep some optimizations of the application code when working on a multi-module project and changing only some of the modules. My plan is that each module will have its own class loaders; one for production and one for test classes. This is also to make sure that the modules don't access classes to which they don't have access, and to allow different modules to use different versions of external libraries. If necessary, Jumi will launch one JVM per module - that would also enable module-specific working directories, to improve compatibility with Maven.

One thing I didn't implement was a notion of skipped tests, but I'm considering adding that, because it means something different than ignored or pending tests. What these mean in ScalaTest are: ignored: test used to work, but I broke it and don't have time to fix it now. Don't want to delete it, so marking it ignored and have a good intention of coming back and fixing it later pending: fleshing out the "specification" of code I likely haven't written yet, but for sure the test I haven't written yet (pendingUntilFixed is a subset of this, for a bug I haven't fixed yet.) skipped: test skipped due to some assumption needed by the test not being met, such as a database being available on the network.

Extended runners could recognize specific test outcomes and report them separately.

For example, an assertion may have failed or an unexpected exception may have been thrown. I currently recognize 'Failed', 'Failed:Error' and 'Failed:Cancelled'. The last one could equally well be treated as a sub-category of Inconclusive but I made it a failure because the cancellation is not something the test can control. No... The test never ran... OR we are treating it as if it never ran (since tests can be ignored dynamically in their setup. This is the most interesting category with options 'Skipped', 'Skipped:Ignored' and 'Skipped:Invalid' showing up in the Gui as grey, yellow and red respectively. I'm considering adding a 'Severity' field to the result so that this coloring (or other text display) is automatic. Yes. This is the one we use in Theories.

    <body>Hi All, This is all very interesting. One difference I see from ScalaTest is that a "theory" is not treated as a special kind of test. J/NUnit "theories" map to ScalaTest "properties." J/NUnit "assumptions" (when used with theories) map to ScalaTest "conditions." And J/NUnit "data points" map to a ScalaTest "table." So for this example from the JUNit 4.4 release notes: @RunWith(Theories.class) You might do this in ScalaTest: A false "whenever" expression is a failed "condition," that causes a "property evaluation" to be "discarded." But the test encompasses all property evaluations. Here there's just two property evaluations, one of which gets discarded, but usually there would be a table of many example usernames, otherwise it isn't worth using a table. So what's missing from ScalaTest at this point is some way to do something like this, also taken from the JUnit 4.4 release notes: That's actually a use of an assumption disconnected with a theory, and it seems useful. I haven't put anything like that into ScalaTest because no one has asked for it, and I wanted to make sure that if I put something in it is based on real requirements. It seems to me that TestNG's dependencies are a similar concept, except instead of an assumption expression (like File.separatorChar is ('/') here) deciding whether a test is "skipped", it is the failure of a dependent test. So one thing I'd like to hear about from JUnit, NUnit, and TestNG users are use cases. How have theoryless assumptions actually been used in practice? What are they good for in reality? The other thing is the naming. To Esko I'd say that I think "skipped" sounds to me most like the generic term that would encompass all of these concepts, so maybe that would not be a good term for me to use in ScalaTest if I end up adding this feature. I hadn't thought of "canceled" until Charlie mentioned it, but that sounds like a clear way to describe a test that for this run is being skipped because of some unmet "assumption." Another word you could consider for your runner, Esko, is "discarded," which is what I use for properties thrown out during a property check in ScalaTest.

    <header>Re: Not knowing the tests in advance when providing a test runner</header>
    <body>Hi Bill, The concept of a Theory is quite different from a normal (example) test and even from a set of examples. That said the implementation, in J/NUnit lags the concept a bit and J/N-users don't generally seem to grok it (yet). The general idea is that a Theory makes a statement that is true for all values meeting a set of criteria. It invites the framework to supply any values that meet those criteria - without any special intervention on the part of the user. The individual test cases are not relevant except in the case of a failure, since the user should be viewing the Theory as a single test. Of course, the syntactic similarity to data-driven tests tends to hide the fact that this is a completely different way of looking at a test. IME, Theories work best when I start out with a theory in mind. Standard tests work best when I only have a collection of examples. The J/NUnit implementation, where the 'givens' are provided within the tests themselves through Assume.That, is not necessarily the only way to do it. We could construct some sort of DSL that instructed the framework about what our assumptions are and allowed the data to be generated. In .NET that's quite difficult because of the limitations of attribute syntax and I suspect it's also true for Java. Charlie  hecks</body>

    <header>Re: Not knowing the tests in advance when providing a test runner</header>
    <body>Hi Charlie, Thanks for explaining the theory behind theories. I think my own theory that this concept is like a property in Scala-land still holds, though. Let me run this past you and see if you agree. Basically a "property" is a statement about something that should be true for all values meeting a certain criteria. The way that is expressed is as a function. The inputs to the function provide one set of values (I.e., to check 100 data points, you'd call the function 100 times, passing in a different data point each time.) If the function returns normally, the property evaluation "passes". If it throws an exception, it "fails." So given a Fraction class, you could have a property like: So whenever the n and d inputs are valid numerators and denominators for the Fraction constructor, the assertions made here (like f.denom should be &amp;gt; 0) should hold. That sounds exactly what you mean by theory, is that correct? And if so, that's called a property in Scala-land, probably because it was called a property in QuickCheck in Haskell, which inspired ScalaCheck in Scala. The idea is you're defining a "property of the Fraction class" that you're testing. So then the question becomes how do you check it. One way is to use the tables approach that I showed earlier. You define some tables with data points in them, and give both the table and the property to forAll: This says that for all the example numerator/denominator pairs given in the table, the property should hold. But you also just say this: That says for all integers, n and d, the property should hold. In that case you'll be using ScalaCheck generators to get the data. So instead of you providing a table of datapoints, the generators will provide them for you, and ScalaCheck provides generators for common data points such as integers. You can create your own generators for your own data types, or to make generators for numerators and denominators that only generate valid values. So I think the difference may be more that theories are methods in J/NUnit and properties are functions in ScalaTest and ScalaCheck. There may be another difference in how theories are mapped to tests in results. Does one "theory check" of 100 data points show up as one test that succeeds or fails, or as 100 tests that succeeded or failed? To see both table- and generator-driven property checks, look at the examples on this page:  Bill  hecks -- Bill Venners Artima, Inc.</body>

    <header>Re: How to prioritize test cases and run using specific prioroty?</header>
    <body>I call priorities "soft dependencies" in TestNG: you want methods run in a certain order but failures should not have any impact on what methods are running. In contrast, if b() has a hard dependency on a() and a() fails, then b() won't be run and marked "skipped" in the report. -- Cédric</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: How to prioritize test cases and run using specific prioroty?</header>
    <body>FWIW, I only use the term "dependency" when b() actually depends on some side effect of a() in order to run successfully. Dependencies can only be implemented by running the tests in a certain order. Calling something a "priority" means that it's more important than another test, for whatever reason reasons. Prioritization may be implemented by ordering the tests but don't have to be. For example, the high priority tests might be given more visibility in the report. Note that I'm not talking about a particular implementation but about a general way of looking at dependency/priority/ordering. However, it is the logical structure I'm trying to use in my own work. Ideally, I don't think we should tell test frameworks how to order tests, but should give indicators of true dependencies and priorities, letting the framework decide how to run the tests most appropriately.

    <header>Re: How to prioritize test cases and run using specific prioroty?</header>
    <body>Both options are useful, and TestNG also supports explicit priorities, so you can specify the ordering either by: Overall, I find that depending on groups is more flexible: you don't say that b() depends on a() but that it depends on the group "init", so that any method that belongs to the group init will always be run before b(). It's much more flexible when you want to add methods down the line. -- Cédric</body>

    <body>Ok, a long shot, there are other libraries with @Test annotations, could it be that simply the wrong @Test annotation is imported? That would the kind of thing that could bite me with some unattentive import completion. (The imports are usually folded in eclipse). I have never experienced any debugger issues myself with eclipse so it doesn't seem highly likely (though I don't uses the debugger much). I also believe that the tests are never run for some reason. Put some sysouts in the tests just to make sure they are actually run and then take it from there is what I would do. /J ----------------------------------------------------- Joakim Ohlrogge Agical AB Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN Mobile: +46-708-754004 Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com Twitter: @johlrogge E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...</body>

    <header>Not knowing the tests in advance when providing a test runner</header>
    <body>Hi there, I'm writing a custom test runner that is not easily able to determine how many tests will be executed in advance. The runner extends ParentRunner and its getChildren method is called prior to tests being executed via runChild. Each test is also described via describeChild. During runChild execution, if I create child descriptions of each child as each unforeseeable test occurs, then I get "unrooted" output. My actual use-case is that I have a test runner executing a series of tests within an html file. I would have to parse the html and its associated JavaScript to determine how many tests will be run. This would be tricky. Is there a recommended means of reporting the results of tests that are not determinable in advance? Kind regards, Christopher</body>

    <header>Re: Not knowing the tests in advance when providing a test runner</header>
    <body>I've had this feature in the back of my head for some time.  The challenge is that some runners (Eclipse, for example) really want names of all the tests you're going to run before you run them.  One current possibility is to actually run the tests during the getChildren phase, and then just report the results during the runChild phase.  That likely delays any output until all tests have run.  Will that work for you? The alternative is an extended listener framework.  Which test runner are you using? tests will be executed in advance. tests being executed via runChild. Each test is also described via describeChild. each unforeseeable test occurs, then I get "unrooted" output. within an html file. I would have to parse the html and its associated JavaScript to determine how many tests will be run. This would be tricky. determinable in advance?</body>

    <header>Re: Not knowing the tests in advance when providing a test runner</header>
    <body>Thanks for the reply. I've now worked around the issue by having the leaf tests consolidate their findings into the master test in a textual manner. A master test is represented by the URL of the page describing all of the tests. JUnit knows about the URLs to invoke in advance. I think what would have been nice here is to fire results as being children of the description originally provided (the master test in my scenario). Having them reported as unrooted isn't technically correct as they are children of a description provided already. Thanks.</body>

    <body>what have you set your JUNIT_HOME environment variable to? When you change to INSTALL_DIR is that the name of your directory? Shouldn't that be an absolute path? I generally do not use the CLASS_PATH environmnet variable, I simply do this: java -cp junit.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore org.junit.tests.AllTests (Or actually, I just run JUnit via Mave,Ant, Eclipse, Gradle, Sbt, Buildr, IntelliJ or some other IDE/Build tool I happen to be using for my current project so I pretty much never start the runner from the command line but if I would do that I would specify the CLASS_PATH on the command line. Windows used to have a pretty retareded limitation on a command line not being able to be more than 255 characters long so if you exceed that you may need to specify an environment variable) Don't know if this helps. JUnit is like any other java program, specify your classpath, point to your main class, provide the arguments for main and off you gol.

    <header>Re: jUnit Test case generator</header>
    <body>Hi Esko, It's not clear to me whether Kalyan wants to generate tests or test cases, or even whether you, he and I have the same meaning for those words. I will use "test case" to mean a set of data for an already existing parametrized test and "test" for the method itself, which has already been written by the developer in the normal way - that is using TDD. Using that terminology, I can see some benefit in generating additional test cases for the preexisting test, since there might be some situations that have been missed in course of writing them. I think such an approach would always be secondary to regular TDD - at least in my own work - but it could be useful. This is something like the effect one gets already from "surprising" combinations of Datapoints using Theories and it's easy to imagine a program that generated additional "surprises." Charlie</body>

    <body>This is a major release to which you should upgrade to. This release makes PODAM very fault-taulerant. PODAM will create a POJO no matter which constructor type you declared (public no-arg, private no-arg, public with args, non-public with args). The difference between 2.3.3 is that while before non-public, non- default constructors were not covered now they are; additionally while before in case of non JavaBean standard constuctors PODAM created an instance but did not populate its attributes, now it both creates an instance and populates its attributes.

    <header>Testing for Spring MVC Portlet</header>
    <body>Hi All, I've setup a project for portlet using Spring MVC Portlet application. Now I need to add testing capabilites using JUnit, my goal is so I don't need to deploy every time I make some changes e.g in the Controller. Thanks</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Testing for Spring MVC Portlet</header>
    <body>need to add testing capabilites using JUnit, my Controller. Whether using Spring 2.x or 3.x, unit testing MVC controllers shouldn't be that hard. This is a testament to the highly decoupled design of the Spring framework.  In Spring 3.x, they take non-intrusiveness even further by relying heavily on annotations and letting you use POJOs wherever possible. In general, you just need to write a JUnit test class that'll perform the responsibilities of the Spring container and provide test scaffolding for your controller's dependencies. Now, if you follow the principle of "design by contract" (also evident throughout the Spring framework) then your controller should be depending upon interfaces, not concrete classes. If so, then personally I prefer mocking those dependency interfaces at test time (using a convenient mocking framework such as Mockito). To a large extent you can still mock concrete classes but using actual dependencies usually introduces transitive dependencies which just makes your test scaffolding more complicated or bloated. As a general example, take a 2.x SimpleFormController that calls an EJB to update an entity. 1. Mock the EJB interface 2. Instantiate the controller 3. Supply the mock to the controller 4. Mock the request &amp;amp; response parameters 5. Call doSubmitAction() 6. Verify that the proper ModelAndView are returned 7. Verify that the mock EJB's update method was called with the proper parameters Like I said, Spring 2.5.x and above simplifies the above greatly by letting you call your controller methods directly with the actual parameters they'll need (you don't have to mock the request or response interfaces). Without specifics as to your controllers, forms and views then this is as much as I can give you. Hope this helps! - alistair --</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Testing for Spring MVC Portlet</header>
    <body>For controllers in particular, you should have no trouble simply instantiating the controller in a JUnit test, invoking its handleRequest() method (or whatever they call it these days--I'm offline so I can't check) and checking the content of the ModelAndView object that it returns. If you need to run your container to run your controller method, then you've broken the principle of context independence: you've made your controller depend on the container, rather than the other way around. If your controller depends on something from the container, or from Spring, then I recommend changing the controller to depend on an interface that that thing can implement. If you pass that dependency in through your controller's constructor, then you'll easy be able to use method stubs or expectations to check that your controller interacts with its immediate dependencies correctly, and be able to run the tests entirely in memory. I hope this helps, and if you need to know more, I'm sure we'll help you. -- J. B. Rainsberger ::</body>

    <header>mock javax.naming.InitialContext</header>
    <body>Hello, in my source code, including following code: so i wonder, in my junit test case, how to mock the InitialContext to look up and return a mock service? Thanks.</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: mock javax.naming.InitialContext</header>
    <body>and return a mock service? The simplest thing I found that worked was to write a StubContext (implements Context) and a StubContextFactoryBuilder (implements InitialContextFactoryBuilder) that returns instances of my StubContext. Not quite a dynamic mock, but I suppose you can use the same techniques with a Mockito-synthesized mock Context. I wasn't interested in mocking the JNDI context per se, anyway. I just needed a convenient way for JNDI client code to be able to resolve names at test time. Anywayâin my test's setup method I call NamingManager.setInitialContextFactoryBuilder() passing it an instance of my StubContextFactoryBuilder(). I also added a check to hasInitialContextFactoryBuilder() to avoid an exception when setInitialContextFactoryBuilder() is called more than once. You're welcome to look at StubJndiContext.java on junit-rules for the code that packages up the above as a @Rule:  les/jndi/StubJndiContext.java Hope this helps! - alistair --</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: mock javax.naming.InitialContext</header>
    <body>I would wrap the context behind my own interface and stub/mock/whatever testdouble technique you prefer that. Then I would add just enough system level tests to make sure it works with a JNDI context in place and use my own interface in the rest of my code. The instance of my interface would be injected something like this: Then you don't have to worry about JNDI anywhere in our code except of course in the JNDI service implementation which would look something like the code you provided internally. When it comes to mocking frameworks, unless you are interested in verifying interactions then roll your own stubs. That way your stub code will be in one place and not spread out and duplicated all over your tests and become an unmaintainable mess of expectations that you don't really care about except as a way to make mocks return the proper values for invocations that happen to occur in your tests. If on the other hand you believe that interactions between roles are important to verify then pick a good mock framework like JMock and learn how to use it properly. I have not read the book yet but I hear good things about Growing Object Oriented systems. I would assume, given who wrote it, that you will find everything you need to understand about mock frameworks and how to use them properly and efficiently without making a mess. I hope this helps some.

    <body>I am running Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers. Version: Helios Service Release 1 Build id: 20100917-0705. I set breakpoints in static methods in a JUnit4 test, e.g. in setUpBeforeClass(), tearDownAfterClass(), etc. I also set breakpoints in non-static methods annotated with @Test and when I debug the test, only the breakpoints in the static methods are hit. None of breakpoints in the @Test methods are hit. I found a couple of posts, one suggested rebuilding Eclipse projects and another suggested using JVM option -XX:+UseParallelGC but neither one worked for me.

    <body>All, I've got good news and bad news.  The good news is that GitHub has released Issues 2.0, which, among other things, fixes the sorting options in the issues display, among other goodies.  The bad news is that they've not only removed the ability to vote on bugs, they've eliminated the ability to display or sort by existing votes.  As you may know, I was using votes as a way of prioritizing future development (and was getting excited about getting to the end of our recent round of red tape, so we could start closing more of them down!) I currently have a request in to github to at least let us know what the final count was.  Moving forward, it seems that the new interface can sort by comment count.

    <header>Re: Report "to implement" tests.</header>
    <body>Hi David, In NUnit 3.0, I'm using the following as a field of TestResult, to represent the overall outcome of the test. It was inspired by the Gallio folks. Perhaps it will give you some useful ideas. [Code is C#, obviously] TestStatus is an enumeration with values Inconclusive, Skipped, Passed and Failed. These are fixed but the string label can be used to tailor the particular result. The following ResultStates are predefined: ResultStates are displayed using the status plus label or just the status if no label as provided. For example: "Passed", "Skipped:Ignored", "Skipped:Explicit" The limitation of this approach is that users cannot define entirely new kinds of results as there are only four fixed statuses. My experience, however, is that folks generally only want \ to define new subcategories within the categories. I'm considering adding a third field, Severity, since some "skipped" results are as serious as outright errors at runtime. I'm not yet sure if it's needed. Charlie</body>

    <header>Re: Report "to implement" tests.</header>
    <body>Hi David, I usually see this concept called "pending" in other test frameworks. It is a useful concept, especially when testing in a BDD style. People like to sometimes "flesh out their ideas" by writing descriptive test names for which neither the test code nor the code under test as yet exists. I do support pending tests in ScalaTest, and when running through JUnit call them ignored tests. That's the closest thing to pending already understood by tools that integrate with JUnit. So if you add something called pending, you could still possibly report it as an ignored test. To see an example, look on line 80 of RunNotifierReporter:  est/junit/RunNotifierReporter.scala Basically I do this: // Closest thing we can do with pending is report an ignored test runNotifier.fireTestIgnored(Description.createSuiteDescription(testDescriptionNa\ me(suiteName, suiteClassName, testName))) So what you could do as a JUnit enhancement is for a pending test call fireTestIgnored with perhaps a subclass of Description called PendingDescription. So existing tools would still understand it is a Description, but newer versions could detect it is a PendingDescription and act accordingly. Or just add some state to Description that old tools would ignore and new ones could use to differentiate pending tests from ignored ones. Something like that would allow you to add the new functionality in a backwards compatible way. In ScalaTest, for example, I could later change the code above so it sends such a PendingDescription notification (though it would be a good long time before I did that because I wouldn't want to force people to upgrade their JUnit for a good while.)

    <header>How to log junit test run results to a database. Easy way to create a hook?</header>
    <body>Hi! I posted this question on stackoverflow. Below you can see the original link. We use junit for integration tests. The tests are being run in Eclipse and Jenkins. Now i would like to log all junit test run results to a database for easy reporting (i want to log test class / method name, environment, duration and success). I had thought about parsing the junit result xmls but to log it directly to a database sounds good to me, too. It sounds intrusive but also pretty elegant. Normally we just annotate a test method with the @Test annotation and voila, we have our junit test method. That means we have no additional framework around junit and i want to keep it that way! I fear that means that if i want to implement that kind of logging i will probably have to hack into junit. Has anybody done so and can give advice if that works nicely? Maybe you have an idea on how/where to place the hook in junit. Or are there easier approaches to my problem? Thanks! edit: To clarify, we already have junit test results of single test runs. You can get them out of eclipse (export junit result) or out of jenkins. Running our junit test suites in Jenkins also allows us to track test failure rates of test suites over time. It shows you a nice chart that tracks how many tests of passed over time. In each jenkins build you can see which tests passed, also in comparison to the last run. We need a bit more. We want to be able to analyse the performance (duration) of certain testcases over time, over multiple runs, maybe also how they behave differently in different environments. Extract trends.

    <header>Re: How to log junit test run results to a database. Easy way to create a hook?</header>
    <body>Personally I would prefer to parse the XMLs in order to keep another dependency (the log database) out of the way of the tests being run. If you don't want to do that, hacking the JUnit jar should not be necessary in any case.  If you can live with adding an annotation for a custom runner or a rule. I don't know if there is a way in recent JUnit versions to add global rules or your own default runner so that you don't have to annotate every test but that is perhaps something that can be added and contribute.

    <body>Dear all, I'm proud to announce that PODAM 1.0.0.RELEASE was released and that it is now available from Maven Central ( PODAM is a Java tool to auto-fill POJOs/JavaBeans with data. Although PODAM's default strategy is to assign random values, users can implement their own Data Provider Strategies to fill data. PODAM provides the following functionalities: - Auto-filling of simple/complex graphs of POJOs/JavaBeans with data (default strategy is random data but you can provide your own) - Inheritance (e.g. POJOs extending other [abstract] POJOs) - Immutable-like classes (e.g. no setters, all final fields and full constructor) - Singleton-like classes (e.g. private constructor, public static factory method) PODAM home page can be found here: PODAM source code can be downloaded from here:  PODAM community can be joined here: Bugs and RFEs can be filed here: JIRA account) It would be nice to hear feedback from you.</body>

    <body>Hi Joakim, I just released a snapshot that includes a new ScalaTest "shell" that was inspired primarily by your work on poju4s. A blog about it is here:  The snapshot works with Scala 2.8. You can download the snapshot release via the scala-tools.org Maven repository with: group id: org.scalatest artifact id: scalatest_2.8.1 version: 1.5-SNAPSHOT Or you can just grab the jar file from:  SHOT/scalatest_2.8.1-1.5-SNAPSHOT.jar I put the Scaladoc for this snapshot release up here:  I didn't do the dots (i.e., outputting one green dot for each passed test instead of the test name). It is something I could add later, but I wanted to see how users actually used this first. If they don't use it to run large suites, then probably dots aren't necessary. Also I don't yet offer a way to run JUnit and TestNG tests that aren't a JUnitSuite, JUnit3Suite, or TestNGSuite. Again I'm not sure people would want to do that, so I left it out and will listen for grumbling. It will be easy to add if that's actually something people want. Give it a try and let me know what you think. Thanks. Bill On Thu, Mar 17, 2011 at 1:33 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge -- Bill Venners Artima, Inc.</body>

    <header>Re: Sometimes my tests fail, sometimes not - why?!</header>
    <body>I have had several issues when working with a the filesystem from unit tests. In theory you cannot expect the tests to be run sequencially as in test A has always run before test B (someone may request to run just one of them by rightclicking on the test in eclipse for instance) so that is a bad assumption. I don't think that is your problem in this case though. I don't know about all the magic that goes on with the filesystem behind the scenes but especially on windows I have seen issues when files are occationaly not deleted properly. I don't remember how I solved it but I would look for things like wether the files are properly closed and flushed before you try to delete them (could be a race condition where the the write stream is almost always GC:ed and closed in that process but sometimes not) that would lock the file for deletion occationall (when the the output stream has not yet been GC:ed). Make sure everything is explicitly closed. It has happened that I think everything looks fine but I have problems anyway. That is when I start imagining that there the issue is related to pounding on the filesystem too fast...  I don't think that has ever been the case though but one gets paranoid. In general when I have to tests against the file system I tend to to the setup a bit in reverse. I use an empty target directory and recusrively delete every file in it both in my setUp (@Before) and my tearDown (@After). This way, in case a run gets interupted midway and the directory is left dirty it is cleaned prior to the next run. This is not a JUnit issue in any case. In general avoid using the filesystem from your tests will spare you lots of grief. Perhaps most of what you want to test could be done in memory with ByteArrayOutputStream/ByteArrayInputStream and only touch the filesystem in that last case when you know everything works, you just want to see that you can replace ByteArrayInput/OutputStream with FileInputOutputStream. A neat sideeffect by coding this way is that it's very simple to change sources/targets (like reading from any URL instead of the filesystem) or filtering (like GZipping everything that is written to the target) which is not as elegant to do if you pass around File objects. By all means make your API able to take a filename/File instance but make usre that the first thing you do with it is creat a FileInputStream/FileOutputStream and pass it on to the next method (using try finally of course). By running in memory you are also better prepared to run tests in prallell etc. No rock solid advice in here but hopefully something that helps some... ----------------------------------------------------- Joakim Ohlrogge Agical AB Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN Mobile: +46-708-754004 Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...</body>

    <body>Is there any need to share a 'static' directory across tests at all? May I suggest establishing a separate location for each test would ensure they don't ever clash, perhaps include the test name in the folder naming? If at some point in the future your tests are run in parallel, distinct testing folders would support this.

    <body>I have done similar tests, where I write a particular file to a directory and then did some processing on it. I never had a problem with this setup. And I did reuse the same directory location for all my tests. I did clean the directory in the @Before-method and in the @After-method (Using jakarta FileUtils). Standard JUnit does not spawn any threads, as far as I know. So the tests are run sequentially. Other runners could change this, of course. If your code spawns threads, that's a different matter of course. And from afar I would also suggest to check for files that where not properly closed. Greetings,</body>

    <body>Nils, Just to come in late.  It looks like the test failures were actually highlighting a threading problem in either your test or code, which you were able to fix, so that's a happy outcome, and you may not need the rest of this message. Like Joakim, I have found that on some platforms (older versions of Windows are foremost in my memory), it seems that deleting a file from Java sometime simply doesn't, and sometimes does, but only after a surprising delay.   One possibility is to use the TemporaryFolder rule in JUnit 4.7 and above.  This creates a new temporary folder for each test, and deletes it afterward.  Since each test automatically gets a different folder, you're protected against any filesystem oddities in deletion. Good luck,</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Sometimes my tests fail, sometimes not - why?!</header>
    <body>It seems from your later mails that you figured out the JUnit internals and eliminated the possibility of threading in JUnit. So, yes, as you know by now A ends before B starts with the standard runner. It seems like you ran into a race condition with the GC, the funny thing is that many resources are closed in the finalize method so it happens that an application that is sloppy with closing resources actually behaves properly most of the time since the GC collects the resources and implicitly closes them. Sometimes the GC is fast enough, sometimes not. When running unittests you generally pound the code quite fast so its way more likely that you run into this kind of problems in your tests than if you run the application under normal conditions. I'm happy you were able to solve your problem. Sounds like it was not a simple one to find. ----------------------------------------------------- Joakim Ohlrogge Agical AB Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN Mobile: +46-708-754004 Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...</body>

(There is no test-method that calls these methods - that is taken care of under-the-hood by BddRunner.) Please note that it is possible for individual enum-constants to override methods and this is what the constants OWNER_NULL and BALANCE_NULL do in order to verify that the null-argument results in the proper default value. values tested for each constructor parameter. Each test will pick exactly one enum-constant from each of its nested enum-classes. This means that Constructor_1 will produce four tests - one for each AccountId-constant. Constructor_2 produces 16 tests - one for each combination of OwnerName and AccountId, where the enum AccountId will be available since it is nested by the super-class! Thereafter Constructor_3 will produce one test for each possible combination of AccountId, OwnerName and Balance etc ... This will result in a total of 84 tests, which will be named like this: single thing in each enum-constant~ and no test-method.

    <header>Re: Is Reflection The best way of accessing private member variables and methods?</header>
    <body>There is an easier way: Don't access them at all. ;-) The default answer regarding privates and testing: You should not need to access private members during a test, since testing goes through the public interface. If there are too many functions, that are private, but should be tested, then maybe they belong into their own class an be public there. But if you do need to access private members, I don't know of any other way then to use reflection. Wait: In the back of my head I remember a project that had a feature that one can access privates just normally from tests. I don't remember the project, though... And I can't find a link in my bookmarks either. Anyone any ideas? Greetings,</body>

    <header>Re: Is Reflection The best way of accessing private member variables and methods?</header>
    <body>Joseph, Either using reflection, or using a framework that does the reflection for you. Before using tricks to access a private member, I will often take a moment to reflect if there's a change that will both: 1) Allow the functionality to be tested without needing private access, and 2) Improve the design overall. With practice, I find it surprisingly common that I can do both. However, it can cause friction if: 1) You're in a codebase where large, multi-responsibility classes are the norm, or 2) You're on a team where the responsibility for writing the tests is not joined, temporally or socially, to authorization to improve the design of the code under test.

    <header>Re: Is Reflection The best way of accessing private member variables and methods?</header>
    <body>Hi Malte, ScalaTest also has a PrivateMethodTester trait:  I agree private methods rarely need to be tested directly, but sometimes it is more practical to do so. An specific example is in ScalaTest I have a private method that parses command line arguments to the Runner application's main method into a nice data structure. This method is used by main only, so I stuck it in the same "class" (actually an object in Scala). To test that method through the public interface, I'd need to invoke main and figure out if arguments had their intended effect by capturing all kinds of side effects. That wasn't worth it to me, and that method really feels like a private helper method of the Runner class, not some general utility I'd factor out into its own class. Being marked private communicates something important about the programmer's intent to later readers of the code. So rather than make it package access or factor it out to make it more easily testable by giving it in my view a less appropriate design, I just tested it via PrivateMethodTester.

    <body>I think it's important to reduce the burden of TDD and having to worry about privates by trying to test them through public interfaces/wrappers is just not agile/ value-adding effort. Testing through a public method is in the direction of integration testing since the public methods will have a different interface, and/or perform side effects, not intended unit testing the private method. And I don't like the idea of changing production code just for testing. Put another way, I'd prefer to reflect on my domain problem/solution, and if I could, I'd prefer not to reflect at all =) P.S.

    <body>Ok, I think I finally get that the argument against testing private methods is a preference to push them down into finer grained classes where they are appropriately "public".  I put "public" in quotes because so far we have considered only the inward perspective, looking "in" toward their declarations. Next, looking outward, I'd like to hear how one prevents them from creeping into the public interface of the system as a whole, which was presumably the point of their being private in the first place.

    <body>The argument: "I don't like the idea of changing production code just for testing" would not rub me the wrong way if the changes generally introduced for testing would not have other benefits as well (hence, the changes are not just for testing at all). It would also not rub me the wrong way if it was not he case that code that is written in a TDD manner turns out to be testable pretty much by definition. Perhaps when I feel that I do something "just for testing" it is a good idea for me to reflect upon if there is some way that I can achieve the testability with other benefits as well. Perhaps now is not a good time to reflect so I write a note to myself to get back to the problem and reflect later. The whole testing private methods discussion would never rub me the wrong way either if I didn't feel that we chose to resort to technical voodoo in order to avoid changing how we generally approach problems and IMO are more or less guaranteed to miss out on an oportunity to learn. The "its not agile" argument always rubs me the wrong way because it's pointless. Frankly I don't care about being agile unless it works better than something else I would be doing. I do the things I do because I know no better way of doing them right now. If I could do less testing I would, since having lots of tests is also quite pointless in itself. It is the effects of having them that I am after. Or seemingly it is the effect of writing them that I am after. I write lots of tests because I know no better way of ensuring that my code has quality and of driving me to reflect daily about design that helps me improve as a programmer. If the point was lots of coverage and exercise every single method as a unit I would probably make all methods public... but it's not... By the way, I have come to find that the private keyword is pretty overrated :) Sorry for the rant... I just need to do that at least once every year :) Anyone is free to disagree and it may very well be because they are smarter or better programmers than I am. If there is anything worth reflecting on in what I wrote then it would be "don't follow the rules, go after the effects" /J ----------------------------------------------------- Joakim Ohlrogge Twitter: @johlrogge Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Is Reflection The best way of accessing private member variables</header>
    <body>I've generally found that it's nearly impossible to get "public" and "private" to mean everything I'd like them to mean: - Whether or not accessing the structure improperly is likely to cause other functionality to break. - Whether or not I am committing to document the structure. - Whether or not I am committing to maintain the structure in future versions. - Whether or not the structure should be accessible to structures in other packages. This is especially the case if you like (as I do) to use packages to group similar functionality, and not just as visibility barriers. So I generally find that, even before considering testability, it's worth having different ways of communicating to clients that not all "publics" are created equal.  JUnit uses "internal" and "experimental" packages to hint at these qualities.  On other projects, I've tried to do the opposite, having the classes I intend to be stable and published in packages that contain the name "api", leaving all others "use at your own risk".  Google encourages a @VisibleForTesting tag, although I prefer to have designs and viewabilities that make sense as outgrowths of a particular design philosophy without considering testing specifically. I believe that while it's important to allow clients that want the safest experience to easily find ways of doing so, it's also possible to make life too hard for clients who want to move forward at their own risk.  (for example,  le-diy-repair.ars I'm sure others have interesting takes on this as well, a preference to push them down into finer grained classes where they are appropriately "public".  I put "public" in quotes because so far we have considered only the inward perspective, looking "in" toward their declarations.  Next, looking outward, I'd like to hear how one prevents them from creeping into the public interface of the system as a whole, which was presumably the point of their being private in the first place.</body>

(Let us know if you were hoping for help on that, as well.)  However, if you want to easily collect all the errors from the various threads, and fail the test if any of the assertions from the various threads fail, take a look at ErrorCollector:  llector.java Good luck, now for each web service I have a test like this: parameters?

    <body>The ErrorCollector rule is interesting, in that assertThat(...) should be sufficient to add items without a change from Assert.assertThat(). How that would work is either to make Assert methods non-static and operate on an instance, or (assuming single test at a time execution), allow ErrorCollector to inject an ExceptionHandler strategy. The default strategy would be: The error handler approach would install the ErrorCollector rule instance as the handler before the test, and verify afterwards, and add to ErrorCollector.  llector.java</body>

    <header>Re: Mark failed assumptions as ignored?</header>
    <body>Hi Bill, Glad my poking around with this was somewhat inspiring. Technically I haven't done anything that can't already be done with ScalaTest and my hopes are that rather than spawning off a new framework, the good ideas are adopted in other frameworks and the bad ones die with this one. Right now I'm primarily interested in running tests and poking around in the results rather than easing the testwriting itself. I'm also curious where I can go with JUnit as a primary foundation, basically conforming to rather than just interfacing with JUnit. Mostly for fun. I decided to make it all public in case it would be interesting to anyone else and for reference when blogging etc. How I "solved" pending and pendingUntilFixed was to use an AssumptionFailed exception since it is the closest thing to an ignored exception in JUnit. Since the existing runners don't treat the assumption-errors as ignored I simply output "pending &amp;lt;reason&amp;gt;" messages on the console when being run. It would be better to have the tests marked as ignored in eclipse but works as a workaround. Quite early I got an idea about some primary goals when running from the REPL and the most important one was: minimize typing - completion is not always available in the REPL (from eclipse, intellij and to my surprise even emacs (though there must be some way to pass the tab along down to the repl?)) Examples of where this has led me: * Only one import * short package name even if it violates javas recommendations * package object with shortcuts to common stuff and a few implicits I really wanted scala tests easy executing of tests from the REPL. The JUnitCore approach is less elegant IMO and it seems like a System.exit in the the cores main shuts down the REPL. That could be worked around of course by instatiation JUnitCore and passing the classes to run. A problem here from a scala perspective is that Java's way to get a Class instance classOf[ClassName] (habit I guess). Long story short, I much prefer scalatests way and I think it's not strange that a language with a REPL inspires more thought in this department. My solution here was dynamic mixins (or static if one prefers). So with a simple "with Basics" you can run any JUnit compatible test from the REPL. Now came the issue with customizing the output. I decided to put that outside the TestCase completely. It feels like a runtime decision. This is when "run" changed to really mean "select" (but the method on interaction is still called run). Basically, the run method just returns a list of Callable[Result]-instances and the BriefReport calls the one by one and prints out the result. This way, the running and the reporting is nicely separated and which testing style you choose has no bearing on the output you see. The brief method could be paired with a verbose method if one wishes more verbose output. Now came the color/no color issue. Color feels like an aspect of reporting. This might be a case of golden hammer but to represent this aspect as a stackable trait felt quite nice. Especially when creating instances of a report: new Brief with Color. One could easily imagine expanding in this direction: new Brief with Color with Summary with SourceDump with StackTraceFiltering with LongRunningTestTopList ExecutionTimeStatistics ... The only problem (ok there are several probably by the obvious problem anyway) is keeping the default as elegant as ScalaTest's spec.execute hence the package object in the poju4s package that allows me to write brief(spec) instead. If I want to run just a few tests that can be done like this (here I assume I have already renamed the run-method to select): brief(spec.select('example1, 'example2)) The fun part comes when I add glob: biref(glob("package/*/*Spec")) or with an implicit: brief("package/*/*Spec"). I agree that named parameters also makes sense, or a combination: spec.execute(color=FunkyScheme, options=List[StackTraceFiltering, SourceDump, ExecutionTimeStatistics]) I also tought about some sort of parameter dsl: spec.select('example1, 'example2) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;: StackTraceFiltering &amp;gt;&amp;gt;: Color &amp;gt;&amp;gt;: SourceDump &amp;gt;&amp;gt;: StdOut (not sure that would work or that I would like it but... as long as we're tossing up ideas) As you say, when something fails what one really wants to see is which tests failed. That is a missing part from my output, just effectively managed to clear those pesky succeeding tests out of the way while still mantaining some feedback that they were actually run. I intend to address that as you suggested, list the failing pending and ignored tests in the summary. I also intend to let the run return some sort of Gist or Summary object that allows one to poke around a bit more in the result (after all it is a REPL so why shouldn't one be able to interact with the result?). Examples of what one could do "post"-running is to dump captured std-out, stacktraces, executiontimes etc, list all the names of all tests of a given status or what have you. I think the best is to leave the information sort of naked and then scalas excellent collection API can do it's magic of filtering, grouping and mapping to the users desire. Why not conveniently allow rerun just failed tests in this way? There is really no reason why these things need to be isolated to just JUnit, in fact it feels like my original idea is much less interesting then to actually explore running and reporting from the REPL in general. For now it is convenient to focus on just one framework but perhaps in the future the good parts can be distilled into a more framework agnostic run/report framework or the most sensible thing is to just leave the ideas out there with a liberal license so that the ones that work can be adopted by framework-vendors as they please... I'm not sure what is best yet but the license is chosen to not be an issue for this to happen :). Long story short: one import seems to be a good idea, separating running and reporting seems to be a good idea, and there seems to be some room for innovating when running tests from the REPL... Thanks for listening to my ramblings! It's so much fun to play with these things without the worries of actually maintaining it for years and years :) ----------------------------------------------------- Joakim Ohlrogge Agical AB Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN Mobile: +46-708-754004 Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...  more-scala-friendly/</body>

    <body>Hi Joakim, It is good to have experimental projects, because I don't want to put anything experimental into ScalaTest. If it turns out to be the wrong thing to do, I'd have to break code to take it out. I always deprecate and leave it in for a good long while, but even that's ultimately a code break, just a nicer way to do it. I did always have in mind I'd like to support use cases of doing things in the interpreter, but am not sure yet how people actually use it. I tend to flesh out working code one bit at a time, with little "tests" I guess you could call them. But they aren't formal tests. After I get it working I put it into the source and then write a more formal test for it. What I'll do initially is format the output of TDD traits, enable color by default when using execute(), provide a way to turn color off when using execute(), and add a summary at the end. That I'm sure about. Bill On Sat, Mar 12, 2011 at 5:07 AM, Joakim Ohlrogge &amp;lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...  more-scala-friendly/ -- Bill Venners Artima, Inc.</body>

    <body>Hi, As with many frameworks, JUnit has its' sweet spot. What JUnit does well is automate the testing. It is very widely supported by many frameworks that leverage it. For example, for Spring applications, there's the Spring Test Framework which is part of the Spring Framework, and also Unitils, which supports Spring, mocking and databases - see However, for your application, you're looking for something that is tuned towards automating UI tests. Selenium is probably the most widely used. We find Selenium to be very easy to create modular and powerful tests suites. We run it from within JUnit.

Even if you do, you don't need to override these methods if you just call the base class' implementation. Maybe ant messes with stdin.

    <body>If your goal is testing through the browser, I think that WebDriver is the current best of breed tool: as a matter of fact, Selenium is absorbing WebDriver in order to use WebDriver's superior API. However, there are advantages to also making sure that you have a way of testing the classes that don't need to know about your web stack in order to function.  There's also advantages to increasing the percentage of your code base that is web-stack-independent.  For those classes, JUnit should work swimmingly.

    <header>Unit Testing with Spring</header>
    <body>I'm working with a client who're using Spring extensively. When I look at their Unit Test code I realize that I'm looking at a heap of integration tests and not real Unit Tests. In part it seems to come from the autowiring of Spring. In addition I've been told that creating new contexts on the fly in Spring can (in their case) really slow the running of the unit tests. I realize that we can bypass Spring completely but the point was made that in that case we're testing without the Spring Security Context and other rules, which means we're not really testing how the code behaves in real life. I'm wondering if any one has good writing on Unit Testing with Spring so I can get my head wrapped around what it looks when its done well?

    <header>Re: Unit Testing with Spring</header>
    <body>Yes it's ironic that testing spring stuff is so painful given that testability is one of the selling points (but it seems that applies to the parts, not the wireing of the parts). The biggest issues I have had are: 1) Contexts are slow to load 2) Programatically replacing stuff in an already loaded conext is not straight forward 3) Having different xml-setups for testing and production soon becomes a nightmare. When it comes to 1 I have come to break the rule of test isolation. I basically load the context beforeClass or even as a *gasp* singleton to only be hit once by the load time. This makes it crucial to be careful about mutable state and side effects in the tests for obvious reasons. It is a bit like juggling with knives but reloading the context for each test is simply not practical. The funny part is that spring sort of encourages mutability by prefering setters over constructors. To some extent you can have a "global" parent context and programatically create child contexts on top of that but I have forgotten how but it's a problem that is solvable within a day or so. If you keep the parts immutable and involve an in memory DB running tests in transactions really help. When it comes to 2 it is difficult, not impossible but if you go with the global context approach it quickly becomes nasty. Again for obvious reasons... When it comes to 3 it sort of forces you to solve 2 and deal with the consequences in combination with 1. This is one of the reasons why people have started considering dependency injection to be evil. Guice however is a completely different story. Modules are lightning fast to load and while guice solves the same problem as spring it does it in a completely different way. Guice is more about defining the rules of wiring rather than the actual wiring and it makes a world of difference. I understand you're stuck with spring now and that guice is not really an option for you. I just mention that so that you see that the experience with dependency injection frameworks doesn't have to be very similar at all to the spring experience we you will later advice people to avoid DIP frameworks entirely when you really mean avoid Spring :) In contrast to spring guice is actually very helpful when unittesting and it becomes much easier to add and remove dependencies. In spring the philosophy is more to be explicit about stuff and that XML stuff... well, I rest my case. Long story short: loading times of contexts is the biggest issue IMO. My workaround for them is to break test isolation and load once, not many. To deal with that I try to eliminate or at least isolate side effects as much as possible. I can imagine that in an existing system that is not really the state of things... Spring has a lot of good stuff in it too like JDBCTemplates etc, I still use those but I wire manually, or if motivated with guice. I don't think, but hope, this helps some :) ----------------------------------------------------- Joakim Ohlrogge Agical AB Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN Mobile: +46-708-754004 Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...  -enough.html</body>

    <body>Joakim - thanks for the reply you confirm what I was thinking. As long as they test within a single context its all good. Basically that means that Mocking goes out the window because I will have to dirty the context and reload. In addition they claim (and I can't disprove) that an in memory DB isn't viable. As for Guice - no such luck. I'm here providing technical advice for a few days, I'm not going to overturn their use of Spring. Cedric - Junit isn't the problem. They're writing too many integration tests and not enough Unit Tests. Your tool may be good but its orthogonal to the problem at hand.

    <body>In one project we were using lots of batches from oracle to MySQL. By the nature of batching there were some DB-specific SQL going on, especially when it comes to "insert or update" logic in combination with jdbc-batch. The SQL was sort of the main part of the logic in this application so not testing it was not an option. Our solution here was to use DB deploy to update the schema to the latest version as part of the test run and run all tests within a transaction. Running "full integration" within transactions. Running within a transaction that was rolled back after the test was fairly fast even if the target DB was a local MySQL and not an in memory DB. And using DB deploy made it really easy to get a developer going. Basically install mysql once, create a DB and grant rights for a user. Then run the testsuite and everything was kept up to date automatically. We actually had some in memory DB tests stuff where we needed to test a lot of different combianations and we could do without DB-sepcific SQLs So my secret weapon here is DB Deploy that in all it's simplicity actually works wonders.

    <header>JUnitRunner that can execute methods in unloadable child classloaders?</header>
    <body>I have a JUnit class that I would NOT call a unit test. Each method connects to a database and allocates a lot of memory. If I run the entire test class in Eclipse, by the second test method it gets an OutOfMemory error. If I run each test method individually, however, I can successfully run all of the test methods. I've set Eclipse to run with just about the max -Xmx setting it can take without failing on startup (although that's probably irrelevant to this). I've set the -Xmx value in the run configurations for the class and individual methods as high as they will go without killing Eclipse (too high and I get an infinite number of "SWT handle" errors). I've scanned through all the relevant run configuration, project, and preference settings, and I don't see anything that will help me be able to run the entire test class, as opposed to running each test method manually. It occurred to me that perhaps this is something a custom JUnitRunner class might help with.  What if it could somehow set up a classloader hierarchy, where each test method is executed in a child classloader, which is unloaded at the end of the method?  I briefly looked at one JUnitRunner implementation, and it didn't look like this was possible, but I'll ask, just in case.</body>

    <header>Structure of junit.contrib</header>
    <body>All, As you may have heard, I'm planning to start a junit.contrib project. In this mail, I'll first review the reasons for such a project, and secondly, I have a proposal for its structure, and I'd like feedback. === BACKGROUND: REASONS FOR junit.contrib === JUnit has always officially strived to be "the intersection of all useful Java testing frameworks".  Thus, the goals for code that gets into the junit repository include that it should: 1) Minimize dependencies on external libraries or particular JDK versions beyond a widely-used minimum. 2) Be very unlikely to change API moving forward. 3) Emphasize opportunities for extension over the richness of core features. 4) Have potential usefulness to all Java developers, regardless of their application domain. 5) Match in style to the current JUnit codebase. Many people have made JUnit extensions that would be useful to a healthy portion of Java developers, but do not meet all of the above criteria.  For example, the extension may target a particular IDE, or data that is stored in a SQL database, or in XML, or it may be experimental, and likely to change API, or it may require an external dependency.  Also, as the popularity of non-Java languages on the JVM has grown, some people have made extensions to JUnit that make it easier to use JUnit's core functionality in ways idiomatic to those other languages. It has always been an option for developers of these extensions to publish them on their own repositories.  However, having a central clearing-house as an option for extension developers has some advantages, including discoverability, documentation, and dependency management. The goal is for junit.contrib (just started on  All Java classes in this project should be in packages prefixed with org.junit.contrib. Now, the === PROPOSAL === The root structure of the project will contain: / Thus, a folder for overall documentation, and then a folder per-language.  I haven't thought about how non-java language extensions should be organized. Under java, there should be a folder per "subproject" (names chosen, with apologies, by java/ Each subproject should be organized as its own maven project: java/brewmasters/ As potential users and contributors to such a repository, are there pitfalls in this organization that I should be aware of in advance?

    <header>Re: Progress on JUnit issues...</header>
    <body>[re-adding list] there are big and important enhancements to be made. Note that the release frequency and pace of enhancements are only loosely connected. testing tools, such as mocking frameworks, BDD tools, tools for integration/functional testing, etc. There are literally dozens of other tools which today provide some form of JUnit integration, usually in the form of base test classes or custom runners for use in @RunWith annotations. Some examples include jMock, Mockito, JMockit (my own tool), PowerMock, JBehave, Spock, Spring Test. just so another tool can integrate itself to the JUnit test execution process. For example, a user shouldn't have to add a specific rule to each test class, or to annotate potentially hundreds of test classes with @RunWith. Instead, better integration hooks should be provided in the form of test run listeners, combined with a mechanism to install such listeners transparently at startup (see issue 80). Would this help in all of the cases above?  I can see how it might help for JMockit, which uses a static API accessed through constructors.  However, other frameworks, like jMock, use a local container like a Mockery or Context to protect tests in different threads from each other, and so it makes sense to use something like Rules to provide both the test hook and access to the container, so a generic listener framework helps little there. I just wanted to be sure how broad you believe the applicability of issue 80 is. parameters in test methods (JMockit already does this, by modifying the JUnit implementation at runtime - not a clean solution, of course), and to obtain access to test class instances so that field injection can occur (this could be added into Description). only be able to provide the best user experience if integration can be made seamless. I've long been a fan of the principle (imported from Perl) that "All's fair if you predeclare".  I think that if using an extension requires more than one line per extended class, that's a place the framework can improve.  However, if users will give us that one line per class, whether as a Rule, @RunWith, or base class (in my current order of preference), it has a big pay-off for both the framework and the user. For example, it allows IDEs and continuous integration frameworks to run individual classes or methods or subsets without having to keep an eye on a global configuration.  It also gives people who land in the source code an easily-followable hint about what's going on. I'd be happy to see an example where these goals (subset running and local code understanding) can be met while not requiring even one line of per-class predeclaration.</body>

    <header>chain runners</header>
    <body>Hello, Is there a way to chain multiple runners? I was thinking of creating an issue for this, but wanted to ask first if I'm missing something. Here's the motivation: SWTBot includes a runner that automatically saves screenshots on failures. I also wrote a runner that works around Eclipse showing failed assumptions as passed tests. In order to use both, I made my own @MyRunWith annotation. So my test class looks a little like this: @MyRunWith(SWTBotJunit4ClassRunner.class) @RunWith(IgnoreFailedAssumptionRunner.class) ... IgnoreFailedAssumptionRunner is based on ideas from  nore/src/programmatically/speaking/dynamicignore/RuntimeIgnoreable.java gnore/src/programmatically/speaking/dynamicignore/RuntimeIgnoreable.java\  Now I'd like to use theories or parameterized tests in combination with both SWTBotJunit4ClassRunner and IgnoreFailedAssumptionRunner, but I can't see how to do this.

    <header>Re: Unit Testing best practices</header>
    <body>Hi Daniel I think you are right on track when you recognize that "validations on the input parameters, providing defaults if the parameters are not valid" will make "the number of testing methods" skyrocket quickly when you want to "test all variations of invalid input on all three constructors". During the past ten years I have spent some time thinking over similar problems myself and the fruit is a JUnit-extension for parameterized tests - CallbackParams couple of months ago. When using CallbackParams for your Account example - a "best practice" could be ... ... one test-class per constructor (similar to David's suggestion) ... one enum(!) per constructor parameter (e.g. enum AccountId / enum OwnerName / enum Balance) ... one enum-constant for each value you would like to test To demonstrate this I have made the class "TestAccount", which is committed to the svn-repo:  ts/src/test/java/org/callbackparams/demo/TestAccount.java?revision=18&amp;amp;view=marku\ p The test uses BddRunner (one of two JUnit-runner offered by CallbackParams) and has this general structure: @RunWith(Suite.class) TestAccount.Constructor_1.class, TestAccount.Constructor_2.class, Unlike traditional parameterized tests the parameter values are not primitive - instead they are enum constants, which each has one @Given-method - for setting up the constructor argument that the enum class concerns - and one @Then-method - for verifying the resulting account. (There is no test-method that calls these methods - that is taken care of under-the-hood by BddRunner.) Please note that it is possible for individual enum-constants to override methods and this is what the constants OWNER_NULL and BALANCE_NULL do in order to verify that the null-argument results in the proper default value. My test-example has four constants per enum, i.e. there are four different values tested for each constructor parameter. Each test will pick exactly one enum-constant from each of its nested enum-classes. This means that Constructor_1 will produce four tests - one for each AccountId-constant. Constructor_2 produces 16 tests - one for each combination of OwnerName and AccountId, where the enum AccountId will be available since it is nested by the super-class! Thereafter Constructor_3 will produce one test for each possible combination of AccountId, OwnerName and Balance etc ... This will result in a total of 84 tests, which will be named like this: Test-class TestAccount$Constructor_1$BDD$ (4 tests) Test-class TestAccount$Constructor_2$BDD$ (16 tests) Test-class TestAccount$Constructor_3$BDD$ - (64 tests) So instead of having "one single thing in each unit test" we now have ~one single thing in each enum-constant~ and no test-method. For the "all variations of invalid input on all three constructors"-thing - CallbackParams handles it by combining the enum-constants. I may be somewhat biased :-) but from how you describe your intentions I think CallbackParams is what fits your needs. For more information on BddRunner:  The annotation @ValidationFailure is used to annotate each enum-constant that is expected to cause an exception. It is part of a Rule-based pattern that is further described here:  Greetings /Henrik Kaipe the net and some attempts on my own, I still have doubts, hope this is a right place to ask. and balance. This class has three constructors: parameters, providing defaults if the parameters are not valid. constructors, for example: test. If I write my test as. practice to test all variations of input values ? multiple constructors and data sets in one unit testing class, or must I spread it into one class for each constructor and data array definition ?</body>

    <header>Sometimes my tests fail, sometimes not - why?!</header>
    <body>Hi there, i have written a simple backup tool and 10 tests. They all have the same structure: 1. Create some test files and directories in an directory called "source" 2. Start the backup process (to backup the files/dirs in "source" to a directory called "target") 3. Check whether all files in "source" exist also in "target" 4. Remove all files from the "source" and "target" directory so that the directories are empty for the next test. If i execute the whole test set ten times, i have 6-7 successes and 3-4 failures. The error messages say that files in the target directory could not be created or deleted (in the last step of the tests, see above) if there is a failure. One possibility i could think of is that the tests are not run sequentially, so they could have influence at each other. But as far as i know JUnit runs all tests in separate threads and those sequentially. Is that correct? Does anybody have any suggestions? I use eclipse helios, JUnit 4.8.1, Java 1.6 and AspectJ Best regards, Nils</body>

    <header>Mark failed assumptions as ignored?</header>
    <body>Hi I have not followed JUnit for a while. I have mostly been using ScalaTest and Midje. Today I felt that using JUnit with scala might not be the worst idea. I feel that the scala tools are lacking in... inderstanding of the TDD/BDD approach (which is just a feeling). Long story short, I want to do something like scalaTests pendingUntliFixed which basically makrs a failing test as ignored until it stops failing where pendingUntilFixed will start failing the test saying that "test was marked as pending but did not throw an exception"  (so that you will not accidentally leave pendingUntilFixed in for code tests that work. I realized that this is very easy to do in JUnit from scala. Something like this: The problem is that pending tests are marked as succeding when they fail. It would be cool if I could somehow mark them as Ignored instead. Is there some exception I could throe that would accomplish this? I sort of thought that AssmptionError would be logical to be displayed as ignored instead of succeeding hence the title.

    <body>Folks... I only ever test a private function when I'm attacking some legacy code. That desire to test is evidence for me of a Large Class smell.  Sometimes in a legacy world, a given class will have broken out the functionality poorly, and it can be dauntingly expensive to re-arrange the entire -- typically testless -- class. When I'm tdd'ing, I only ever create a private while refactoring from an adequately tested public. Cheers, Hill  Real Advise For Real Coaches</body>

    <header>Re: Testing a helper class with a factory method</header>
    <body>Doug, I've found that discussions about what constitutes a "unit test" vs a "developer test" can often be improved by focusing on the goals. If your current implementation is sufficient to catch the bugs you care about, and it runs fast enough in the situations you wish it did, then you're good to go.  There's several situations in which you might want to consider redesigning to provide more isolation and flexibility: 1) You want to hypothetically test situations which are difficult to simulate with a real database (for example, what if the initial connection works, but subsequent calls to the database time out?) 2) Connections to the database are slow enough that your personal development rhythm stalls. 3) The test database you want to use is not reliable enough, or is not available everywhere you wish you could run the tests. In those cases, you might consider using a test double for the database, to isolate the behavior of SQLHelper from the behavior, performance, and availability of the underlying database. Does that help? this.password, this.driver) "newInstance" which unless given a correct url and a valid driver will throw an exception.  So in providing this information it's making me think this is more an integration test rather than a unit test.  Am I off course here?</body>

    <header>Tooling feedback please: JUnit @Test, @RunWith etc annotations as meta-annotations proposal</header>
    <body>I'm currently pursuing a number of proposal to enhance the DRYness and clarity of JUnit based tests. One valuable improvement in this area would be to allow common annotations to be specified and documented in one place as meta-annotations. For example, the @Category annotation can be applied to classes or test methods to mark the suite or test as belonging to one or more categories. Without meta-annotations, you can end up with something like: @Category(SmokeTests.class, PerformanceTests.class) and @Test(timeout=100) @Category(PerformanceTests.class) or, for Spring users, you get: @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration("classpath:/repositoryMocks.xml, classpath:/service-context.xml") @TransactionConfiguration(defaultRollback=true) @Test(timeout=1000) @Transaction(readOnly=true) With meta-annotations: /** * Description of the general approach to service layer test and why these specific contexts are used */ @Documented @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.TYPE) @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration("classpath:/repositoryMocks.xml, classpath:/service-context.xml") @TransactionConfiguration(defaultRollback=true) /** * This is used to test user interactions where services can be running against read-only repository slaves... etc. * The default timeout is according to our quality of service requirements...etc. */ @Documented @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @ServiceLayerTests @ReadOnlyUserInteractionTest As shown, the ability to allow JUnit annotations to be specified as meta-annotations adds a big win to development teams working on large projects where common approaches and centralised documentation will benefit. With changes as proposed in  to recognise meta-annotations. For those of you who work on tools based on JUnit, it would be great to get some feedback on this, as you may be looking for the @Test etc annotations yourself, but not as meta-annotations. -- Neale Upstone Open Credo Ltd  Excellence in Enterprise Software Development Certified SpringSource Delivery Partner</body>

    <body>All, Over the last week or so, I've triaged almost 200 JUnit issues that have accumulated over the last year, closing about 80 truly invalid issues that were fixed, duplicates, or no longer made sense. I tagged the rest with: - regression bugs (9): there was an implementation of the feature that worked prior to the 4.9 beta (although potentially earlier than 4.8.x)) - nonregression bugs (15): it is likely the feature has always failed in the documented way. - features (~95): additions to the (implicit) spec, with implementations to provide the additions. Thanks to everyone who has been submitting problems, proposals, and patches.  I'm sorry that some of you have been waiting so long for a response. The next part of the development plan, in order: - Fix the regression bugs - Release a 4.9 beta 3 - Hopefully 4.9b3 can become the final release.  (I am not planning any nonregression bug fixes or new features to get into the 4.9 release.  We need to steer this ship back toward frequent releases.) - Create a github project for junit.contrib. - Go through the backlog of pull requests, to see which can be accepted as is, and which either need changes, or should be redirected into junit.contrib. - Work through non-regression bugs for further releases in the 4.9.x series - Choose a number of highly-rated feature requests to be the scope for 4.10, and begin (patch acceptance / implementation) I'm excited to see this project keep moving forward,</body>

    <body>David, There is a problem in parking feature requests for 4.9 in that 4.9 is a feature release and introduces API changes e.g. TestRule, which are subject to debate over API (e.g. the desire from the Spring point of view to have Object target in there to allow us to replace SpringJUnit4ClassRunner with a Rule). If TestRule is released as is in 4.9, then it's setting a very constrained direction which will be difficult to change in 4.10. -- Neale Upstone Open Credo Ltd  Excellence in Enterprise Software Development Certified SpringSource Delivery Partner</body>

    <header>Re: Progress on JUnit issues...</header>
    <body>Neale, Excellent point.  However, I think the Open/Closed Principle should guide us here.  TestRule is a distillation of a subset of MethodRule. That subset of MethodRule has already had dozens of uses in open source code accessible to Google Code Search, without need for enhancement.  I consider TestRule a fairly well-tested API addition. I'm looking forward to releasing 4.9 with TestRule as currently specified, and then, in the 4.10 cycle, figuring out new extension points that will have a similar bang-for-buck.  See, for example,  influenced by some of your feature suggestions.  I'm hoping it will go a long way toward solving the Spring extensibility problem among many others.

    <body>Not sure I'd describe Eclipse as having gone stale.  Is there anything on bugzilla for this feature? Last time I did something around this (which was adding support for did a patch.  The feature got added. I'm sure a decent patch would also be true of marking an assumption as ignored.  What's the score in CI systems?  I've not used assumptions there.  Do they too just register a failed assumption as a passed test?  more-scala-friendly/</body>

    <header>Re: Mark failed assumptions as ignored?</header>
    <body>Careless phrasing from my side. My apologies. My perception is that there has been a slowdown in the eclipse development when it comes to exciting surprises from version to version. I have not payed as close attention during the recent year or so as I used to and my focus have been more specifically on the scala support than anything else. I prefer Eclipse over other IDE's for java work. I guess I just don't get blown away by new stuff much lately. So "gone stale" could probably just mean "matured". On the other hand, assumptions have been around for a while... I don't know how CI-systems handle assumptions but I've had chance play with the JUnit runner enough lately to see that failed assumptions are reported as assumption-failures via the RunListener so there is no reason why they couldn't treat assumptions specifically (but I think that team city at least did not do that). I think with assumptions the situation is a little bit that support is not added because people in general don't use it much and people don't use it much because it's not well supported... (and maybe not well known... but what comes first..) /J On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 8:12 PM, Neale Upstone  more-scala-friendly/</body>

    <body>Hi Joakim, On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 3:18 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge ScalaTest to make writing JUnit tests in Scala more productive. And perhaps you're aware you can run ScalaTest tests in the Scala interpreter by invoking execute on them. So for example given this test: import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer import _root_.org.junit.Test import _root_.org.junit.Before You could run it in the interpreter like this (both ScalaTest and JUnit need to be on the classpath): user-64-9-237-191:scalatest-1.3 bv$ scala -cp scalatest-1.3.jar:junit-4.4.jar Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22). Type in expressions to have them evaluated. Type :help for more information. scala&amp;gt; :load HowSuite.scala Loading HowSuite.scala... import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer import _root_.org.junit.Test import _root_.org.junit.Before defined class HowSuite scala&amp;gt; (new HowSuite).execute() Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun Just create a new instance and call execute on it and it will run. (This is a JUnit 4 test class, so JUnit can run it jut fine. In this case you're asking ScalaTest to run it, though what ScalaTest does is turn around and ask JUnit to run it, capturing and displaying the results.) If you want to run just one of those tests you can specify it by name: scala&amp;gt; (new HowSuite).execute("verifyFun") Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun And you can pass in config map of configuration information to execute if you want. It works, but it is ugly. The output has two problems. One is that because I loaded the class with :load into the interpreter, instead of compiling it, I get very long names for the class name with lots of dollar signs. So one enhancement would be to drop everything to the left of the first dollar sign. I'm pretty sure I'm doing that somewhere else in ScalaTest, so I could do it here. The other annoyance is you get info on both TestStarting and TestSucceeded, two lines of info for each test. What I originally did was only format the output of BDD style test traits, because BDD was in part about output that looks like a spec, and TDD was not. But I've gotten clear feedback that people using the non-BDD traits would like pretty output too, so I've already decided to change that. So it should soon look something like: scala&amp;gt; (new HowSuite).execute() HowSuite - verifyEasy - verifyFun Another thing I did originally was not show color when you use execute(), because I wasn't sure how to let people turn color off, and I felt it was worse to force color on people whose terminals didn't support it than the other way around. But people really like color. It is pretty and makes it more readable. So what I'd like to do is figure out some way to let people configure color, full stack traces, and durations when using execute. Now that Scala has default params, that's probably the right way to do it. So color would be the default, and to turn it off you'd say: scala&amp;gt; (new HowSuite).execute(color = false) And lastly, your dots idea is interesting. Whenever I run with a standard out reporter, I get lots and lots and lots of green test names that passed. And what I really care about is the ones that failed. So I think it may make sense to add one more option to the standard out/err and file reporters that just shows one dot for each passed test. And then that could possibly be the default for execute, maybe. And lastly lastly, maybe execute should show a summary line at the end, like the runner does. As far as getting JUnit to do something like pending and pendingUntilFixed, that will be tough until JUnit can treat some kind of exception specially. Be nice to have a TestIgnoredException that gets reported as an ignored test in JUnit someday. Bill  more-scala-friendly/ -- Bill Venners Artima, Inc.</body>

    <header>Re: Need BeforeSuite and AfterSuite functionality</header>
    <body>Dean, Sorry this has gone on so long without a conclusion.  I think we may be working from different assumptions.  Let's see if an example helps. Given this code: @RunWith(Suite.class) Given the current implementation of JUnit, there will never be any instances of the class AbSuite created.  There will be three instances of A created, right before the execution of a1, a2, and a3, and likewise for B.  I believe that you are assuming that one instance of AbSuite gets created, and it should be possible to store data and execute methods against that instance.  I think that could be an elegant way to get what you want, although there are design issues to think through, to make sure that all the existing functionality makes sense in that world.  Would you be interested in opening a feature request to discuss that? In the meantime, here's a more complicated way to get what you want with today's codebase: @RunWith(WrappedSuite.class) This takes advantage of the fact that a new Runner is constructed each time AbTests is run, and hangs the behavior and data off that runner instance.  Will that work for now?  Good luck, write a record to the database.  Each instance will have its own uuid which will be stored in the record in the database and then stored in an instance variable for use by the AfterClass method.  The AfterClass method will update that same record referred to by the uuid.  If the BeforeClass is static I have to store the uuid in a static variable - which would result in the uuid being overwritten if multiple instances ran simultaneously.  AfterClass could update the wrong record because the uuid had changed.  I definitely don't want a static method if there is a chance the TestSuite could be executed simultaneously. in Before / After class methods, make those methods non-static and they can call a static method for the static functionality.  Forcing them to be static creates concurrency issues if more than one instance runs concurrently. static methods. TestSuite was created.  I don't know how JUnit creates its instances - I was just guessing.) end the collection of performance metrics.  I definitely don't want them called concurrently. AfterClass can just call static methods if static functionality is desired. not once per test.  It is possible (but not likely) that my test suite could be executed concurrently in the same JVM, so static methods could be a problem. suites.  The javadocs are confusing: class have been run." not clear what will happen with a suite. suite. @Test in the Suite itself.  It is not clear to me that AfterClass would be called in this case (a Suite with no @Test in it). need to implement is once per instance, not once for all instances.</body>

    <body>Marc, Yes, surely they can: ForkingVMTestRunner: additional runner ParameterizedRunner: additional runner NotYetImplemented: an additional annotation enabled by an additional Runner or additional Rule. assertEquals &amp;amp; IDE integration: an additional static assert method (when we change the built-in assertEquals, it breaks tests that have been running fine for years.  This tends to cause Bad Days for already over-worked people.  A separate static method is an easy way for people to opt-in to the new behavior) Most interesting is ParallelRunner.  From your description, this appears to be a Runner that exposes the work already latent in the ParallelComputer class and others.  It would be interesting if you had to make any changes to the existing classes in order to produce this new Runner without duplication.  Thanks, ? a runner executing the unit tests in a forked virtual machine allowing to test effect of command line JVM switches for instance - ParrallelRunner JUnit already contains nearly the whole code for that but not available as runner running tests in parallel - ParameterizedRunner a runner far more flexible than JUnit's Parameterized runner allowing to configure usage per method (a bit like TestNG) and for different types - @NotYetImplemented this is an annotation allowing to indicate that a unit test is expected to fail. A failure should be reported as success whereas a success should be reported as failure. This has proven to be far more interesting than @Ignore which is just a little better than removing a test: @NotYetImplemented allows to write tests for "accepted" bugs or future features and to get notified when they are fixed as side effect of other changes - assertEquals &amp;amp; IDE integration small improvement to throw ComparisonFailure not only for String comparison what allows IDE like Eclipse to better display differences between expected and actual result.</body>

Even better it would align the code to what is currently done for Strings. just make the anonymous RunnerScheduler in ParallelComputer.parallelize reusable and it's done. This was my last email on this subject. This is clear to me that you are not interested in what I propose. I'm not really surprised as it confirms the experience made by others in the past.

    <header>Re: Re: Misc improvements</header>
    <body>Marc, But Rules can be composed. Changing AssertionFailedException to AssertError as part of the upgrade from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4 internally to Google broke dozens of test suites.  People write custom assertion packages, and then write tests for those packages.  I'm quite sure that this change would have a similar effect, multiplied by a much wider user base.  It would be odd to me to assert both that this change is so useful, it's worth the potential breakage, but so useless, no one would be willing to change their static imports to use it. If we were to make this available in junit-contrib, we could see how wide its usage was, and then have data to add to the discussion, not just the force of our convictions. I'd welcome a patch to do this. Marc, I invited you to submit your ideas to the same process that everyone else's ideas are evaluated.  You responded that responsiveness in that arena was lacking.  I spent a long time thinking about that, and sent a long response entitled "JUnit issue responsiveness", where I tried to directly discuss the "experience made by others in the past", and my plans for improving it.  I have invited you to contribute to those plans.  I have, in total, spent several hours addressing these ideas of yours, at no cost to yourself, not even the time it would have taken you to copy and paste your ideas over to github. Every addition into the core JUnit jar has a cost, as well as a benefit, to future maintainers, extenders, and users.  At this point, I do not think that changing to a model in which someone mails five one-line ideas to a mailing list, and I simply say "sure, I'll accept all of those patches if you write them" would be beneficial to everyone involved.  Please, try to convince me otherwise, ideally over at the thread "JUnit issue responsiveness", so I can learn from your experiences. I'm sorry if this does not appear to you to be "interest".  I truly hope that you, or other interested users, can partner with me to take JUnit forward, and welcome your contributions in the future.</body>

But yes, this accomodation is not: We will build it all into JUnit. And that's ok for me (as a JUnit user). If that's the only acceptable answer for you, than I feel sorry, that we all can't benefit from your contributions. Kent Beck and David Saff work hard not to break existing usage of JUnit. That's a deliberate decision and it's quite reasonable, considering the large user base, that JUnit has. They also work hard to keep JUnit itself small (lean and mean), so it can be maintained and developed easily. They built lots of extension mechanisms to allow for the type of contributions, that you would like to make. If these extension mechanisms are not quite enough yet, then I would work to improve those in the JUnit core. (Combinable Runners might be one of those things, that are missing yet.)

    <header>Automatic parallel- (aka regression-) testing in JUnit</header>
    <body>Hi there, I hope this is the right group to ask. Terminology in the literature is a bit all over the place so please be patient and let me try to clarify. (I'm also coming from a different language.) What I'm about to describe could potentially be done continuously, but it is drifting away from Unit testing into Integration/Story testing that I would do e.g. every day, or every week. Say I have a method that outputs an object of type MyClass. I have a version of this method in production, and I know it outputs an acceptable object. When I have a release candidate, I would like to calculate the object with the new code and compare against the object calculated with the production code, ideally according to a user-defined tolerance for floats. Let's say I have an integration test which simply calculates the value and performs some intrinsic tests on the output. I would imagine that with some generic, recursive reflection and persistence it would be possible to extend JUnit so that I can just add one line to my integration test, so that 1. if the test is run in "integration mode", that line is ignored 2. if the test is run in "regression_base mode" against production, it persists the output value (expected) somewhere 3. if the test is run in "regression_compare" mode, it loads back the expected and automatically and generically compares it against the actual that I already have in memory at that point and this would work for an arbitrary object of an arbitrary type, without requiring the test writer to write anything else. Something like this running in. Do you think this can be achieved in Java? Perhaps something has already been done? Thank you</body>

    <body>Hi Julian, Let's say I have an integration test which simply calculates the value and I think so, though I haven't tried it. Here's an approach that occurs to me: - Declare the mode via a property on the command line. - Do assertions using objects rather than static methods. One asserter object does nothing. Another saves the actual result without comparing. The third compares actual to saved. - Use a factory to supply the appropriate asserter object, depending on the mode.

    <body>Thanks Dale, To be honest I'm not too concerned about how to implement the plumbing, but how to achieve the core bits, i.e. the generic comparison (ideally picking out floats that are to be compared according to the given tolerance) and the generic persistence of arbitrary objects.

And if you're going to do global side effects, you might as well make the method static. Yes, and also allowing users to never be sure that changes to instance methods in one method won't corrupt results in a different method.  If a user that is not an author of either framework is truly fascinated about the differences in design philosophies between the two frameworks, my guess is that they will create a thread with an appropriate title, so that those people just trying to get their work done can mute it and move on. I don't encourage it.  JUnit encourages people to think about ways to push their designs in tests in directions so that most of their tests do not require setup that is so expensive they have to wring their hands about how often it runs.  When that fails, JUnit allows users to easily separate the static state, which they _want_ to think about maintaining between tests, from the instant state, which they are glad to let the framework set up and teardown for them.</body>

    <header>JUnit issue responsiveness (was: Re: Re: Misc improvements)</header>
    <body>Marc, In your position, I'd be frustrated, too.  I'll respond to the direct situation on the original thread, but I wanted to talk here about the larger context. For those not aware of the context of Marc's comment, the highest-voted issue on github is now over a year old, and there are 140 open issues.  By reducing the time to resolve issues, we wouldn't lose the effort of motivated developers like Marc. Here's a first couple of steps. 1) For several years now, issue triage and patch acceptance has been one of several priorities that have competed for time during pair programming sessions between the developers.  One benefit was that the project didn't get away from either of us, and we were able to evaluate proposed changes from multiple perspectives.  I'm going to try taking solo point on these activities, with Kent as advisor.  Give me a couple months to get a routine going, and then let me know if the project seems like a more appealing place to contribute. 2) As part of this, I'll try to provide feedback within a week on new issues and patches.  This may mean that feature requests we are unlikely to incorporate will get closed quickly, rather than left open and abandoned.  Let me know if it starts feeling like too much pushback. While this will apply to new issues and patches, there's still a backlog to get through.  I can't estimate how quickly I'll be able to get through it, nor am I sure in advance whether I will prioritize the communication backlog above all new development activities.  If you've read this far, and would like to bump your issue or patch up in the queue with a reminder message, I should see it. JUnit will likely continue to grow more slowly than your average open source project.  This has had advantages in maintaining a coherent core of concepts and limited churn in the core.  There are things like reporting and data parsing that the core junit.jar file is unlikely to ever do, as it strives to be "the intersection of all useful test frameworks, not their union".  The Runners and Rules included in junit.jar have always been intended as examples and starting points for further extension outside of the core. I think there could be value in a bundling of JUnitUnion: the JUnit Core, plus a set of very useful and reusable extensions managed by people outside the core JUnit team.  I'd love suggestions on the technical and managerial ways such a super-package could be maintained and distributed. Thanks for sticking around.

    <body>Hi John, I doubt you'll want to add another dependency, but were you to use a ScalaTest Suite of some kind with an @RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner]) annotation on it, JUnit would ask ScalaTest to run those test classes. In ScalaTest, you could override the run method such that it would only run the class if it hadn't been run before. The good thing is it would solve your problem. The bad thing is you'd need to add the Scala jar and ScalaTest jar on your class path, and that may not be possible or desirable for you. Moreover, you'd need to write the runOnlyOnce test classes in Scala. Actually it occurs to me just now that you should be able to create a JUnit runner in Java that does what you want: just executing each test class only once. Then annotate your test classes with your own runner: @RunWith(RunOnlyOnceRunner.class). I think that should be a possible way to do what you want. If you want to try the ScalaTest way, let me know and I can help further. Bill -- Bill Venners Artima, Inc.</body>

There were a couple of minor snags with your attempt below, but with some minor tweaks, it seems to be working nicely. 1. [compile time issue] The @RunWith needs to fully qualify OnceOnlySuite (i.e., prefix it with 'All.') I decided to just make it a public top-level class since its use will not be tied to a particular suite. 2. [runtime issue] The collection (Set) has to be a instance field of OnceOnlySuite, not the anonymous inner RunnerBuilder(), since the latter's instances are ephemeral. John</body>

    <body>Hello David, thanks for your reply. I've managed to successfully implement the runner and get our existing tests working. I've packaged the extension up through maven and included it in our new projects. To get the tests in the new project executed, I need to create an almost empty class, like this @RunWith(QuercusRunner.class) Is there a way I can automatically execute a fake test with this runner in every project that includes my jar? So that users don't have to create such a dummy test. Like specifying it in META-INF/some-file so that JUnit picks it up automatically? Thanks a lot, Dominik that I'm able to include our test files in a maven build and let them be run through junit (and all the nice junit plugins for IDEs). of comparison line by line with the &amp;lt;compare&amp;gt; block. possible to run such tests with JUnit (by extending it?) or not. the project and junit would then pickup the files and run them as tests.</body>

Eclipse can run all tests in a package/directory, but has problems with suites, such that it executes the tests and the suites, executing the tests at least twice.

Before posting my question, I tried to create the suite of suites as David suggested, but I couldn't: JUnit gave me errors and did not execute the tests (maybe the @SuiteClasses annotation didn't behave as expected with suite of tests...

    <body>Extending TestCase is JUnit 3.x and is wrong for JUnit 4. Don't mix annotations (@Test, @Before, ...) which are JUnit 4 with extends TestCase, which is JUnit 3. It actually harms, since Runners get confused etc. Your Setup-Class doesn't need to be a test. You can write assertions in any class/method. It doesn't need to be an @Test-method. It needs to be called from an @Test-method or @Before method for JUnit to catch a failing assert, of course. You could also write a class with several @Before methods and subclass it. And you might want to look into JUnit Rules in JUnit &amp;gt;=4.8. That might solve you problem nicely. Enough food for thought? Any questions? Greetings,</body>

In your position, I'd also be frustrated. The idea was to guide people away from an improper usage of Rules. For example, calling Timeout.apply in the middle of a test method is so likely to be the wrong thing to do, that we wanted to make it difficult.  If there were some way for a rule to expose one interface to the framework, and another to test writers, that would be ideal. This seemed like the next-best solution. Can you go into more details about this case, and how hard it would be to adapt your code to use TestRule? as I don't add another rule to the test. silently ignored. This isn't what should be happening.  The ordering of multiple rules is undefined.  What this means is that if you have a Rule (whether TestRule or MethodRule) that sometimes or always blocks or interrupts the call to base.evaluate(), then it may prevent other rules from starting or completing. There's been recent discussion on a way to be explicit about the ordering of rule application.  If that would be helpful here, let me know. So, I now have 1 user (kcooney) on record for preferring the abstract superclass (because it prevents confusion and improper usage), and one (dgageot) on record preferring the interface (because it frees up the superclass slot).  If anyone else has opinions, please chime in by this time Monday, so we can make a decision and lock it in.  Thanks, `@ClassRule` sense implements `RunRules`</body>

    <body>That's true. And I do prefer 'cannot inherit sometimes' than 'cannot inherit ever'. Seems logical to me. Didn't realize that the benefit was hidden in the 'protected' keyword :-) We could check at runtime that the method is being called properly but that would be less elegant and could be tricky. The class I inherit from has dozens of methods. That's not the best use case of delegation. However, I ended up doing exactly that. Overall when I design code, I prefer interfaces over inheritance, but I Agree 100%. Thanks for the insights, David.</body>

    <header>Need BeforeSuite and AfterSuite functionality</header>
    <body>I have a test suite and need BeforeSuite and AfterSuite functionality. I probably could make BeforeClass and AfterClass work, but there is no @Test in the Suite itself.  It is not clear to me that AfterClass would be called in this case (a Suite with no @Test in it). BeforeClass and AfterClass are also static methods and the functionality I need to implement is once per instance, not once for all instances. It's unlikely that my test suite would ever be run more than once in the same JVM so I could probably make BeforeClass and AfterClass work - if AfterClass is guaranteed to be run after the Suite is finished. Is there a pattern in JUnit for BeforeSuite and AfterSuite functionality? Thanks.</body>

    <header>Re: Title: JUnit 4.9b2 (beta-)released</header>
    <body>I agree that design is a tradeoff. And I also often prefer interfaces over abstract classes. But I do not always use interfaces. Interfaces and abstract classes both have their place. It's hard to find simple rules to decide what to use where. I personally don't see having TestRule as an abstract class causing a burdon for competent developers. Since TestRule has only one method, it's very easy to use delegation to share code. You could have your Rule have many methods that delegate to another object, or your Rule could have a single accessor to get the delegate, or you could create the Rule by calling a method on another object. In any case, what we could use is data. Can someone give concrete cases were making TestRule an abstract class has caused problems? Let's get them out now, before 4.9 releases. -- Kevin</body>

    <body>Hello Dean, I'm not quite sure, I understand what you want. Putting @BeforeClass and @AfterClass into a suite will execute the @BeforeClass method once before the suite and the @AfterClass method once after the suite is done. in the Suite itself.  It is not clear to me that AfterClass would be called in this case (a Suite with no @Test in it). Suites don't containt @Test methods. Suites gather Tests suites, but don't contain tests themselves. @Test methods in a suite don't get executed, since a suite is not a test. need to implement is once per instance, not once for all instances. Here is what I don't quite understand: Once per instance of what? Do you mean once before every test-method that is executed and once after every test method that is executed? Or do you mean once before the suite and once after the suite? The pattern I know of is: @BeforeClass and @AfterClass in the Suite-class. If you want to execute once before every test method and once after every test method, you need @Before-methods and @After-methods in the tests. Or use JUnit 4.8 @Rule Greetings,</body>

    <header>Title: JUnit 4.9b2 (beta-)released</header>
    <body>Hello, everyone.  We're happy to announce the release of JUnit 4.9b2. This release's theme is Test-class and suite level Rules. More information linked from  and release notes below. Share and enjoy, and please try it out and give us feedback.  Thanks, Your friendly neighborhood JUnit maintainers ## Summary of Changes in version 4.9 [unreleased!] ## Release theme: Test-class and suite level Rules. ### ClassRule ### The `ClassRule` annotation extends the idea of method-level Rules, adding static fields that can affect the operation of a whole class.  Any subclass of `ParentRunner`, including the standard `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner` and `Suite` classes, will support `ClassRule`s. For example, here is a test suite that connects to a server once before all the test classes run, and disconnects after they are finished: @RunWith(Suite.class) @Rule @Override @Override ### TestRule ### In JUnit 4.9, fields that can be annotated with either `@Rule` or `@ClassRule` should be of type `TestRule`.  The old `MethodRule` type, which only made sense for method-level rules, will still work, but is deprecated. Most built-in Rules have been moved to the new type already, in a way that should be transparent to most users.  `TestWatchman` has been deprecated, and replaced by `TestWatcher`, which has the same functionality, but implements the new type. `TestRule` is an abstract base class, and its abstract `apply` method is protected.  In order to apply `TestRule`s to a `Statement`, use the `RunRules` class in `org.junit.rules` (thanks to `@kcooney`) ### LICENSE checked in ### The Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included in the source repository. ### Bug fixes ### - github#98: assumeTrue() does not work with expected exceptions - github#74: Categories + Parameterized - github#163: Bad comparison failure message when using assertEquals(String, String) ### Minor changes ### - Backed out unused folder "experimental-use-of-antunit", replaced by - Made MultipleFailureException public, to assist extension writers.</body>

    <header>accessing JUnit runner/suite objects at runtime (or... rule for a suite)</header>
    <body>I have created a custom JUnit 4.8 category (and an associated suite to run this category), as well as an associated annotation which must be set. I need to verify that for each class with the custom category, the custom annotation is set properly. I'm trying to find a way to do this in JUnit, without forcing all my test classes to have a common base-class. So far, the only way I can think of handling this is to create a Rule.  However, since a Rule does not seem to work with a Suite (and therefore Categories), I believe that would require a common base-class for all my tests, which is something I'm trying to avoid. It seems if I could access the JUnit objects directly-- either via a singleton/static API, or via fetching annotation objects, I could fetch my category, find its list of test classes, and iterate over them verifying the annotations. Has anyone tackled this before?  Any ideas? Thanks -Steve</body>

    <body>Hi Steve, singleton/static API, or via fetching annotation objects, I could fetch my category, find its list of test classes, and iterate over them verifying the annotations. It isn't clear to me whether you're trying to test your test classes, filter them, or something else. If you're trying to filter them, perhaps my Runtime Suite stuff would help:  and filter test classes and methods. (Sorry it's a Maven project. I hate myself.

    <body>Thanks Dale. Actually, I want to test my test class annotations. For example, I have a category called FailingTests.   I have created an annotation called BugNumber (with a string). I want to verify that all the tests annotated with category FailingTests must have a BugNumber annotation, and the BugNumber annotation must have a valid string value. For example, this would pass the test: @Category(FailingTests.class) @BugNumber("1234") @Test And this should failing the test check, because the BugNumber is not valid (missing in this case): @Category(FailingTests.class) @Test Based on the recent JUnit 4.9b2 release notes, it seems I might be able to use rules with suites in the near future.

    <header>How to make JUnit work with own test format</header>
    <body>Hi, I'm working on Quercus, a PHP implementation in Java. To test our implementation, we have a huge amount of tests. Each test is contained in a text file someName.qa which is a sort-of XML file. These tests are currently run through a self-made test-runner. I would like to replace this custom test-runner with a JUnit-extension, so that I'm able to include our test files in a maven build and let them be run through junit (and all the nice junit plugins for IDEs). our test layout currently looks like the following module/ module/module.xml &amp;lt;- a file containing ranges for test-sections module/0001.qa &amp;lt;- a single testcase Please tell me, if the following assumption is correct: I think to accomplish what I want, I need to create a special implementation of - org.junit.runners.Runner and/or of - org.junit.runners.model.TestClass A test basically looks like this: DOM loaded So we're running the content inside the &amp;lt;php..&amp;gt; block and do a string comparison line by line with the &amp;lt;compare&amp;gt; block. I know, thats not best practice, but currently I just need to know if it is possible to run such tests with JUnit (by extending it?) or not. The ideal (end-)scenario would be, that we just put our test files into the /src/test/qa folder of a maven module, add our junit-extension artifact to the project and junit would then pickup the files and run them as tests.

I am trying to understand ways to make open source projects profitable[2]. So far I thought only GPL with commercial licensing is an option, but the CPL trick is also cute. I have one question, however: I can imagine buying a commercial license is good for closed source projects. But how can a commercial license be suitable for an open source project like NetBeans? If we want to stay open source, we cannot have a commercial license on one of our libraries! We need to have an open source one. We need to let 3rd parties to take parts of our IDE and use them in an open source manner. I am sure we are not the first ones to have this problem, and you have some solution, right?

    <header>The story of the JUnit license</header>
    <body>All, Since the question about the JUnit license came up recently, I thought I'd clarify the story of why the license is the way it is. Pre-license For the first year or so of JUnit's existence we didn't have a license at all. The code was out there, people used it, nobody worried. CPL After a while it became clear that JUnit was going to be popular. At the same time IBM's lawyers discovered open source. Since Erich and I had been equally involved in the project from the first, we needed to have a license and it needed to be one that the IBM lawyers approved of. This was roughly the time that the CPL came out, I believe with IBM's support. We adopted the CPL, more or less by default. I want to be clear on this point. The CPL isn't a cunning trick or a political statement. It's just the license that made sense at the time. Commercial licenses About five years ago I began receiving questions from company lawyers about the CPL. They object to the patent provisions for reasons I cannot explain because I have never received an explanation that made sense to me. In these cases I offer to write a commercial license for JUnit with terms that meet their needs. Sometimes the inquirer purchases the license. Sometimes they don't. Re-licensing One of the options is to issue JUnit under a new license that no one would object to.  I don't have any plans to do this. The costs of the conversion are considerable, and would be paid by me. The benefits of the conversion would accrue to large corporations with big legal staffs. It doesn't make sense to me to spend my time for free to make their lives easier. From my perspective, if a company can afford the lawyers to object to the CPL, then they can afford a commercial license. The vast majority of users have no concerns with the current license. I suppose there is a fantasy scenario where Large Corp. decides to sponsor JUnit for a bazillion dollars a year and as part of the deal I change the license, but that doesn't seem likely at this point. Conclusion I can see that from the outside my position looks a bit like extortion: you (big company) don't want bad things to happen, you'd better pay up. From my perspective, though, my position makes sense. If you can pay to object, you can pay to make the objection go away. I have donated many thousands of hours of my time to my community. Should I donate more of my time so lawyers can sleep better at night and give up a source of revenue in the process? That's the part that doesn't make sense to me. I can see the conflict between the two perspectives but I don't have a resolution. Anyway, that's the story of the JUnit license. I'd be glad to engage in followup discussions here if folks have any questions or comments.</body>

    <header>Re: The story of the JUnit license</header>
    <body>Just an idea that popped up in my mind: Would it solve the problem if someone sponsored the move of JUnit to another licence, instead of bying a commercial license? As such this sponsor would invest in the community to make JUnit even more accessible to others. Greetings,</body>

    <body>Kent Beck wrote on 01/14/11 07:37 AM: the I offer If you don't understand why people object to the patent litigation clause, well, then you're like me a few days ago, or like most of the people who use JUnit - you've been completely fooled by the implications of the license.  Start here:  change-2 As I now understand it (IANAL), the CPL provides a huge disincentive to anyone who depends on JUnit to enforce their patent rights with a contributor to JUnit *for software completely unrelated to JUnit*.  CPL (and EPL) contains a similar patent retaliation clause limited to the licensed program (e.g., JUnit), but it's this broader clause in CPL that is problematic. As licensor, you might think this is a good thing. If you believe software patents are evil, you might think this is a good thing. As licensee, if you have a significant software patent portfolio, you should be concerned. Ask IBM if they're willing to use someone else's software under the terms of the CPL license. I fully understand why you would want to offer commercial licenses for JUnit, and why changes that reduce your ability to make money that way would not be attractive.

    <body>Very interesting, thanks for sharing the links!  ense-proliferation/ It has not come to my mind[1] that EPL1.0 supercedes CPL1.0! When I asked for "more modern license" I did not know how close I was. Proliferation of various open source licenses is bad and I am glad upgrading to EPL1.0 is allowed by CPL1.0. It can safe a lot of troubles. Now, when it is clear that EPL1.0 is the natural evolution step, I can offer some help. Kent mentioned that he has no capacity to change the license himself. I can help changing all the JUnit sources and create a patch. The rest would be just a matter of incorporating my changes into main source line and releasing binaries for under the new license...

    <body>As the text of an e-mail does not carry the facial expressions and tonality of the spoken word, I'm not sure if your sarcastic or not.  (Even though, I do have a reduced ability of this compared to others.) Assuming that you were serious.... I can not speak for the authors of the language, nor do I care to.  Yet, I've always been under the impression that to transfer a fork of an API under a new fresh license, a person/group would have to start without any of the original code.  I'm no lawyer, but to claim that a patch to a given set of source code could release without holding onto the original license might not be possible under the copy left provision. As a plea from myself, others may join in... Please don't make my life more troublesome by introducing a freshly grown JUnit-esque API, that some corporate manager like.  While as a developer, I will see some uniqueness that will make my code writing experience less enjoyable. But as The Dude would say to me...

    <body>I just wanted to reiterate what others have pointed out. Because the EPL has superseded the CPL as its new version, it is not necessary to seek the approval of past contributors. You can simply re-license the code under the EPL as other projects such as Mondrian and olap4j[1] have done. Obviously, the license is your decision. I just want to clarify that the burden of moving to the EPL is relatively low. See the second last paragraph of Section 7 of the CPL and EPL.

    <header>Re: Re: Unit testing a private method??</header>
    <body>Mike Forsberg wrote on 5.12.2010 2:17: For me too, the speed of running the tests is important. If it takes over 5-10 seconds to run all the tests, then I will hesitate to run them after every change, which in turn will lead to slower feedback and longer times in finding the reason for a failure: If I run the tests less often, I will make more changes between running tests, and the mistake could be in any of those changed lines. But if I run tests after every one-liner change and the tests break, there is a high probability that the mistake was on that one line and I will find it quickly. So I will have near-100% test coverage using unit tests, which I will run many times per minute; these tests must run at a speed of hundreds or thousands of tests per second. Then I also have a small set of end-to-end tests, which I use the verify the existence of features and that all the components have been plugged together correctly. P.S. When using Guice, I might have a unit test which creates the Guice Injector to check that the DI configuration doesn't contain such obvious errors which Guice's built-in checks will find. But I would not instantiate the SUT of my unit tests using Guice, because that's slow (on my C2Q6600 CPU about 5 ms to create the Injector), and because it would not put as much design pressure on my code (more on that later). Another reason is that by writing focused unit tests you can focus better on making that unit behave correctly in all corner cases (pun intended). For example, I was writing a small transactional in-memory database and had to introduce locking of multiple keys as an atomic group (my integration tests were sometimes failing due to a concurrency bug - so at integration level the bug was reproducable, but very non-deterministic), so I wrote a GroupLock [1] class which I could then use in the database. What do you think, could all the corner cases mentioned in [2] be covered reliably with integration tests for a multi-threaded system? In the same in-memory database there were also other low-level components which I test-drove using unit tests, because test-driving them using higher level tests would not have been possible with small steps. When I was test-driving the database class, at first I had all the values in a HashMap, but then when I started to implement transactions and multiversion concurrency control [3], I basically needed a versioned Map which remembers some of the previous values, until there are no active transactions which can read those old versions. This produced the five Revision* classes at [4], in total over 400 LOC, and I don't see how I could have test-driven those using only integration tests. So I grew those classes using the four Revision*Spec tests at [5]. [1]  t/orfjackal/dimdwarf/db/inmemory/GroupLock.java [2]  t/orfjackal/dimdwarf/db/inmemory/GroupLockSpec.java [3] [4]  t/orfjackal/dimdwarf/db/inmemory [5]  t/orfjackal/dimdwarf/db/inmemory Still one more reason why I write unit tests (in addition to end-to-end tests), is that writing unit tests is more painful [6]. To be able to test something in isolation, the code needs to be decoupled and cohesive, and it needs to avoid global state and many other traits of generally bad design [7]. When dealing with bad code, writing unit tests causes *more pain* than writing integration tests, which is a *good thing*, because it leads me to improve the design so that writing the tests will be easier. This in turn leads into better code and a more maintainable design. If I would write only integration tests, or even no tests, then I would be shutting my eyes to the problem points in the design and there would be no pressure to improve the design. P.S. In the Growing Object-Oriented Software book the authors say that also writing end-to-end tests puts design pressure on the system as a whole, which leads to for example introducing monitoring hooks into the system. These hooks in turn also happen to be useful for monitoring the system in production. [6]  [7]  -- Esko Luontola www.orfjackal.net</body>

Given that the description can tell you everything you want to know about the test method and test class, I'm guessing that rules would need to interact directly with targets only rarely.

    <header>Re: Why no target parameter on TestRule.apply()?</header>
    <body>Great question.  As usual, the docs are lagging the implementation a bit.  A couple reasons: 1) Most rules don't appear to use the target. 2) 4.9 introduces ClassRules, for which there is no target to supply. 3) Rules that need the target can easily ask for it at creation (see below). 4) There seemed to be some documentation benefit in being able to see which rules actually used the target. A (half-hypothetical) example of a rule that can use the target is a auto-mocker, which can be used thus, with "this" passed into the Rule's constructor: Hope that makes sense, and thanks for the blog post!</body>

Example: Now I am using the following code for Exception handling: Now, I have multiple classes using this try-catch teqhnique. So, is there a way to avoid this, i.e. can JUnit somehow detect when a certain type of Exception occurs, making it possible for me to perform exception handling before continuing as normal?

    <body>jogrimst, It depends.  With Rules in JUnit 4, you can hook up a Rule that will have a chance to handle any exceptions thrown by all test methods in a class, and you can add that Rule to each class with a single line. However, it looks like you might be hoping to restart the test method after the line that throws an exception.  If you're looking for that, I'm not aware of any Java package that has that capability. Good luck, exceptions named WebDriverException. entire test suite collection in a webapp? multiple Java classes (JUnit), is there any way to detect when certain Exceptions are thrown and then handle them in one single place? way to avoid this, i.e. can JUnit somehow detect when a certain type of Exception occurs, making it possible for me to perform exception handling before continuing as normal?</body>

    <header>More modern license?</header>
    <body>Hello JUnit guys. I know my post is going to sound silly, but I'll try anyway. We have new lawyers. Our new lawyers seem to be concerned about the JUnit license. True, JUnit's use of Common Public License is unique and sort of archaic. I don't know about any other (important) project using this license anymore. Right now we are holding our release and getting ready to remove JUnit from our standard installation. Silly, I know, JUnit is necessary part of any serious Java development, but there is not much we can do. Except to ask: Don't you want to relicense JUnit to some more commonly used license? EPL would be fine. At least I have not heard any complain about EPL from our new lawyers yet. Dual licensing to CPL &amp;amp; EPL probably too. Thanks for reading my post and sorry for bothering.

    <body>The maven directory structure is by far the most popular "standard" arrangement, and can be seen at  ry-layout.html This structure is used by a lot of non-maven projects too, simply because following a well known convention is better than making your own. An interesting side-effect of the maven structure is that the unit test resides in the same package as the class being tested. This permits the use of package-level protection for exposing "non-public" information to the test. I know this is generally frowned upon, but sometimes nice anyway. Personally I find the semantics of using "protected" so much more convoluted (that keyword communicates so many other things), so I find package level protection as nice alternative without all the feelings that come with "protected".

    <body>I agree with both of you. Except... I haven't heard anybody but raw beginners claim that private methods don't need testing. You are ignoring the most frequently stated issue with the testing of private methods. In the wild, when folks "need" to test a private method, it most usually means that they aren't looking carefully enough at the design of the class they are testing. I'd say that 9 times out of 10, the average developer should split the class rather than reach inside to test a private method. Charlie 2010/12/3 CÃ©dric Beust â &amp;lt;cedric@...&amp;gt;:</body>

    <body>Sorry, but Lasse seems to disagree with both Charlie and myself. He's saying that you should never test private methods directly, only indirectly through public methods. I find this angle puzzling, since as I said above, if you follow this reasoning, since all your code is already being tested indirectly by functional testing, why do unit testing at all? The main reason why I sometimes want to test private methods is not fear, as Lasse claims, but simply the fact that this functionality can break. Therefore, it deserves a test of its own. There are two extreme ways to test private methods, both bad: I tend to favor the middle ground approach, which is to relax the scope of the method so that tests can see it. Making it package protected and putting a comment ("/* for testing */") usually works, but if it doesn't, I don't have a problem with making this method public for testing. -- Cédric</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Unit testing a private method??</header>
    <body>It is scary to hear of code that may have broken functionality in a private method while the caller methods do not reveal the classes brokenness.  If a private method were performing incorrectly, yet all the functionality exposed at the protected level and above works correctly, one would have to ask, "What is the man behind the curtain really doing?". In a slightly different vain, if a developer were writing tests as sign posts to signify that an error has occurred, shouldn't that sign post be viewable at a higher then private level. Consider a public API that is tested thoroughly and is functionally correct.  Yet, there is a private method that still has a functional error. This should be a signal that the extra incorrect functionality is unreachable or unnecessary. In regards to... why do unit testing at all if everything is tested through functional testing. Personally, if I could get every scenario to run at the integration/functional level within the time I can run my unit tests, I'd only write unit tests to track down why the higher level tests are failing. In this amazing world, a unit test would only be needed to track down a bug since my brain is not big enough to hold the whole system in it's mind. However, once the bug is fixed, the unit test can grow stale.  As I'd be assured that every possible scenario is tested. For me, the reality is that customers don't care that - every method performs correctly - a given method supplies incorrect answers in certain conditions They only care that the result they need is correct when they need it. Since it is the customer that is paying me, I'd rather only care what they care about. Making a rough calculation that - The price of enough machines to run every integration/functional test within a reasonable amount of time is too much money. - I don't write perfect code, and I'd most likely need targeted tests that can run parts of the system in case there is a bug. - Since I know what I'm changing when I change it, I can keep a corresponding set of tests up-to-date with the code changes. It behooves me to keep some unit tests laying around. Then, since they are laying around and are up-to-date, why not run all the ones above the code that I'm changing.  And thus I keep a set of unit tests for each class.  Should I run all the unit test?  Nope, if their code was not touched, then they should still pass.  If it is the case that the tests might fail, then I might have bad architecture or class design. My two cents, Big Mike</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Unit testing a private method??</header>
    <body>That's a truth that too many engineers tend to forget about, and this is why in the grander scheme of things, functional tests are so much more important than unit tests. Here is the reality: unit tests are a comfort *for the developer*. Functional tests are a necessity *for the user*. Functional tests allow you to make sure that a functionality that you are shipping and that will be used by your consumers will work as expected. Unit tests give you no such guarantee. 100% unit tests might be passing and still, your application might be completely broken. This is the reason why if I'm pressed with time and I have to choose between writing a unit test or a functional test, I will choose to write a functional test 100% of the time. Then later, if I find some extra time, I'll try to write a few unit tests that will allow me to converge toward problems faster. Because that's all unit tests enable: faster pinpointing of a problem. If 100% of your tests are functional, you will still find the problem but it might take you a little longer. Not a big deal. It's unfortunate that unit tests have become such a high focus of attention lately (and another reason why TDD makes me uncomfortable). High emphasis on unit tests and on TDD is engineers trying to make their work easier. It's a laudable goal, but it should never come at the expense of the person whom you are working for: the customer. And the only tests that really matter to the customer are functional tests. -- Cédric</body>

    <body>2010/12/5 CÃ©dric Beust â &amp;lt;cedric@...&amp;gt;: I tend to try many different approaches to software development, since I plan to be doing it for decades to come, and don't want to get stuck in a local maximum.  I pay special attention to techniques that people I trust say good things about, but I haven't tried, or haven't been successful with.  At this point, I find that test-driven development, with the discipline of changing my design when writing the unit tests hurts, produces the highest-quality software at the highest speed.  I expect I'll continue to try variations on the formula and others. This isn't the first time that Cedric and I have discussed this particular point, so you can probably refer to previous mails on this list if I don't expand every thought here. - Most engineers and craftsmen consider it professional to have structures they use during design and construction that make their job easier, but might not obviously contribute to final quality from an outsider's perspective.  Home contractors might use scaffolding, temporary lighting, pencil marks on the walls, clamps.  As a customer, I do not begrudge these tools, saying "without that temporary lighting, you'll probably make more mistakes, and it might take you longer to find them and fix them, but eventually it will get done." - On being "pressed for time": I assume that a very experienced auto engineer can make a professional decision, when pressed for time, about whether to thoroughly test the airbags in my car using crash test dummies, or using a more isolated lab test.  I also really hope that if both are valuable, a very professional auto engineer makes sure there's time in the schedule for both, and doesn't spend a lot of time arguing with peers about which to drop in order to shorten the schedule. - No tests matter to the customer.  Working software matters to the customer.  What produces working software is a matter best investigated through history and experience. Thanks,</body>

    <header>Question about @Category and @SuiteClasses</header>
    <body>Hi there, Yesterday I was trying out the new features in junit 4.8.x and noticed that while Categories and SuiteClasses seem to be what I needed to group my tests into different "testing frameworks" I realized that the xml reports generated are not what I expected. The total number of tests I run is around 60k. They're currently grouped into "testing frameworks" like frontend tests, backend tests, rdbms, api, webservices, etc. The tests are run through ant and these frameworks are just filesets that include or exclude different file directories. This seems to work fine for us, as the reports generated are per-class, so we can quickly know which class a specific test case belongs to. The reason I wanted to define my "testing frameworks" using Categories or SuiteClasses is so that the group definition are closer to the java code and developers are more in control as opposed to having to manipulate the ant filesets. However, when creating a "Frontend" Suite all the test methods in the frontend test classes are shown in a single report, so I don't know if testMethodA belongs to com.frontend.ClassATest or com.frontend.ClassBTest. Is there a way to use Categories or SuiteClasses for my use case? Thanks!</body>

    <header>Re: Running in parallel with categories</header>
    <body>Yes that solution is supported already; you can force surefire to use the 4.7 provider and just run an explicitly coded suite as the build target using &amp;lt;includes&amp;gt; statements. To my (relatively limited knowledge) the missing functionality is really just to be able to pass in the category name as a string parameter, probably using the groups parameter which is implemented for testng ( Surefire already scans the entire classpath looking for tests, so I assume we'd be able to resolve the string to one or more java classes (possibly working backwards from @Category annotations we find when scanning the classpath). Then we could just dynamically create a test suite and send it in, doing something like the answer in this question:  -of-classes Would that be the way to go ?

So, there's two ways to fix what's going on: 1) If the number of elements read on each line of your testFile is going to be constant, you could explicitly name them in the constructor: 2) If it isn't, then you'll need to wrap the array in an array: In either case, you deserved a better error message.  Can you log a bug for that? On Fri, Oct 8, 2010 at 11:32 AM, beauchesne.david figure out how to fix it. Could someone point out where my problem lies?</body>

    <header>Running test with guaranteed method order -&amp;gt; cookbook/FAQ?</header>
    <body>Hello Although junit is designed to run the test methods in arbitrary order, e.g. for sorting often failing ones first or just to be safe that there are not dependencies, every now and then someone has a valid case where it could indeed be useful. One solution is offered in the API docs of Request.sortWith()Â¹ but the example seems only to work for standalone calls not for running the tests with @test annotations from an IDE or automated tool. For these cases it would be nice if you could write an example like the one below in the FAQ or the cookbook as it took me a while to figure out how to do it. bye tiaraki Â¹:  va.util.Comparator%29</body>

So, I'm not sure in how many test cases "callThisMethod(some arg)" is being used, but what I want is whenever "callThisMethod(some arg)" is called, then based on the condition in this method the rest of the asserts for this test should be executed or skipped. For example in  testcase1() when callThisMethod(some arg) is called and condition is not met I don't want to execute the remainign asserts in that test and instead go to next test. However if the condition is met I want to execute the asserts.

    <header>QuickCheck-style parameter suppliers for JUnit theories</header>
    <body>Hi JUnit, I'm intrigued by Haskell's QuickCheck tool for specifying properties that should hold for given functions and peppering the functions with lots of random values to see for which ones the property holds or doesn't. It occurs to me that JUnit theories are akin to such properties. But how to feed the theories lots of values to see the results? I decided to use a ParameterSupplier and annotations on the target parameter, e.g.: @ForAll would be marked @ParametersSuppliedBy(Generator.class), where Generator inspects the ParameterSignature it's given and spits back a list of PotentialAssignments each with a new random int as its value. I've begun to explore these ideas in a project of mine on GitHub:  your constructive feedback. Is this useful? The closest things to this I could find are JCheck ( which uses a custom test runner, and Functional Java's Reductio. The ParameterSupplier solution seems like the one that plays most nicely with JUnit. What a wonderful extension point ParameterSupplier turns out to be! Thanks,pholser</body>

    <header>Re: QuickCheck-style parameter suppliers for JUnit theories</header>
    <body>Paul, Love it in theory.  Can't wait for time to play with it.  How do you decide how many values to throw at the method?  Do you have some further favorite examples?</body>

    <header>Re: QuickCheck-style parameter suppliers for JUnit theories</header>
    <body>Hi David, thanks for the feedback. Currently @ForAll has a sampleSize() property with a default value of 100; this is how the corresponding ParameterSupplier decides how many values to produce. This is all rather embryonic -- not much to it right now but a @ForAll, controlling sample size, and the ability to produce values other than primitive/primitive-wrapper numerics from a source of randomness. I'm open to any suggestions for enhancement of this stuff. It's not (yet) as sexy as to seek out interesting inputs via JUnitFactory/Agitator, but we'll see where it goes. Thanks for making JUnit so easy to extend. --p</body>

    <header>Using the class constructor to create mock ups</header>
    <body>Hey everyone, I have sent some questions regarding how to test methods using whole OR-mapped classes in a bundle. I got some very useful tips. However, I looked again at the mock up proposal. My ORM classes provide a constructor which assigns every class field a variable. So I came to the point to use: new Course(2,5,0,null,null,null,null,roomList); This means I set every value I will not need for my test case to null. Is this also a way to create mock up objects? Because implementing real mock ups with a factory method and replacing its content like its proposed in a paper from IBM, seems a bit overloaded if I can use the constructor only. Am I on the right path? Best regards, Konrad Reiche</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Using the class constructor to create mock ups</header>
    <body>Konrad, In general, the idea of a mock object is to change the focus from the data stored in collaborator objects to their behavior.  Many people find this encourages designs that have many other useful properties. So, I think that few people would see using a concrete class's constructor with some values set to null to have the same advantages as a mock object.  Myself, I find that if I'm regularly using null in my tests, it means I have one class doing more than one thing, and I look to split it up.  Good luck,</body>

The situation is bad enough already with junit vs. junit-dep, let's not make it even more convoluted.

I'm thinking of test names, test descriptions and parametrised tests. Parametrised tests are a trivial matter in NUnit, in the NUnit GUI you can see each test case in the parametrised test and the input values for each case. JUnit doesn't have this, so I thought I'd compensate a little by writing the parameters to the JUnit window.  It's surprising how often you want to see details of your passing tests so you can compare them with the failing ones.  In order to be useful, and to get my colleagues to agree with me and hop on-board, it needs to be easy to read and require as little code massaging as possible.

    <header>what should I do first? upgrade to Java 6, or write unit tests?</header>
    <body>I've recently become responsible for a piece of software, that runs under java 1.4.2.  it has NO unit tests. I want to move it to Java 6, but the CTO of my company is thinking that we should write a unit test suite first, so that we can make sure the upgrade doesn't break anything. That's a nice idea, and I'm fully behind writing some unit tests.  I'm not sure that the plan is very practical, as I'd really like to start with a recent version of JUnit -like 4.8, and I can't use it with java 1.4.2 We do have a reasonable suite of integration tests (which are NOT unit tests), to ensure that the upgrade goes well. I was considering, rather than writing unit tests for java 1.4.2, and JUnit 3.8 and then potentially rewriting all of them to run under JUnit 4.8 after the upgrade, it would be better to upgrade the JVM first, rely on integration tests, and then write unit tests from scratch for JUnit 4.8.

I notice that a number of the issues you're tackling are mostly about IDE integration--I wonder if thinking about the interface you wish IDEs would talk to, and then getting at least one IDE to agree to it, would be a good approach.  I've tackled a few of your questions below--going deep on one of them, of your choice, might be the most productive way forward, rather than trying to hit all of them at once. There are advantages to the "declare everything before running anything" requirement from JUnit, but I agree that it also makes some things very difficult.  I'd love to see a standard way to address this within JUnit. In terms of IDE integration, JUnit just reports a tree of Descriptions, and results against them.  Runners are free to structure these trees however they wish.  Have you run into IDE limitations for displaying/interacting with these trees? That assumption is in the IDE's.  It's a useful one, but it's neither required nor assumed by JUnit itself. We've taken several stabs at this.  The biggest hurdle is how to extend the test-definition language: while many tests can be parallelized without cost, and test writers should not depend on order, they currently might depend on only test being written at the time. Test discovery seems to be yet another feature of a common IDE interface.</body>

    <body>Hi Esko, David, them is that is that you can make a progress bar that gives feedback to the user as the tests run. That's a really nice feature in GUI test runners that is lost if you can't count tests in advance. It would be possible to make the advance test count an optional feature, but then when tests can't be counted, you couldn't show a progress bar. And I think that would be a pretty big loss. The downside of the requirement is it becomes difficult to use the same token all the way down nested closures (like you use "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;" in Specsy). If you use a different character to denote leaf nodes, then  those leaf nodes (the tests) can be counted (and their names known, etc.) before they are run. That's what I do in ScalaTest. The other thing you can do is run all test code at construction time, and just store results to be reported later. I think that's what Eric Torreborre does in Specs, because he also uses the same "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;" or "in" token all the way down. This is a design tradeoff, and I think the world wants to keep their progress bar and can live with the above two approaches to nested closures in Scala test code. of nesting closures in test code. Several traits in ScalaTest do that, but the model I use in ScalaTest is that each leaf node is one test. The closures surrounding the leaf nodes are descriptions, not tests themselves. I would think you and Eric could  adopt that approach in Specs and Specsy without much trouble. Bill -- Bill Venners Artima, Inc.</body>

    <header>Re: Common Test Runner for JVM</header>
    <body>Yes. In addition to programming I do also interaction design, and usability is very important to me. My development process is to first design the UI and after that think about what is needed to implement it. Quite many times a good user interface affects all levels of the implementation. Yes, that's what I'm planning. As Linus Torvalds says, "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." My current plan is to implement a minimal set of features, create a UI and integrate it with IntelliJ IDEA. Then people can better see what this is all about, and can better decide whether it's something that they like. I will setup a dedicated mailing list and contact the major tool vendors after I have something working to show (right now I'm only gauging some interest on JUnit, scala-tools and simple-build-tool mailing lists). I've thought about that. It's possible to measure progress at least on the class level. And within a class, the completion of a class can be approximated as more tests are discovered. I'm also planning on making the tool remember statistics from previous test runs (and do some classloader caching of external libraries, to speed up the test runs), so after the first test run the tool will know quite accurately that how many tests there are and how long each of them takes to execute. I've also thought about some ways to detect which classes are covered by a test, which information can be used to run first the tests for the recently modified classes. So there might be some features similar to JUnit Max (I haven't used Max because it's not available on IntelliJ IDEA). It would be possible for me to detect the leaf nodes after the tests have been run, but I prefer the UI to show the correct mental model of what is happening during test runs. To illustrate, here is a partial version of one of Specsy's example specs with some println() debug statements. @RunWith(classOf[Specsy]) To execute that, Specsy needs to instantiate and run the class two times. The first test run will print: Stack() Stack(pushed last, pushed first) Stack(pushed first) The second test run will print: Stack() Stack(pushed last, pushed first) Stack() My vision is that the UI would visualize where one test ends and another begins. It would provide the same information as the following examples (but better visualized ;). Test run 1: Stack() Stack(pushed last, pushed first) Stack(pushed first) Test run 2: Stack() Stack(pushed last, pushed first) Stack() Then when I select "StackSpec" or "When objects have been pushed onto a stack" in the tree of tests shown by the UI, it would show both of those test runs, because those tests were included in both of them. But if I select "the object pushed last is popped first" then it will show only test run 1, and if I select "the object pushed first is popped last" it will show only test run 2. True. I would like to make that concept explicit, so that the testing framework could help the IDE with code navigation. I've been thinking whether to make parallelization enabled by default. From a usability point of view, I would prefer to "design for one user" (as advocated for example by Alan Cooper) and as such I'm tempted to write the test runner for programmers who write tests which don't depend on any global state (i.e. I would design it for myself :). For tests which cannot be executed safely in parallel, my plan is to make it possible to annotate the class with @LocallySequential or @GloballySequential. The first annotation would still allow running tests from other classes in parallel, but the second annotation would execute this one test class all alone. And build tools. One thing that I'm also trying to solve, is minor differences between running tests in the IDE vs. running them through a build tool. For example IntelliJ IDEA executes all tests in the project using the same classpath, but Maven uses the classpath of the module which contains the tests. If two modules use different versions of a library (I have one such project), then this difference might be important. Also I want to get rid of bugs such as  does not run Scala classes which are annotated with org.junit.runner.RunWith". Running tests is such an important feature, that I don't want it to have any bugs. -- Esko Luontola www.orfjackal.net</body>

    <header>Re: Common Test Runner for JVM</header>
    <body>Hi Esko, What you say you want here makes sense. My point is that it doesn't require nested tests. You can do it with nested descriptions. That's the approach I take in ScalaTest. In ScalaTest the test names for StackSpec two tests would be: When objects have been pushed onto a stack the object pushed last is popped first When objects have been pushed onto a stack the object pushed first is popped last But when you run it through ScalaTest's standard out reporter, for example, the output would look something like: StackSpec: When objects have been pushed onto a stack - the object pushed first is popped last - the object pushed first is popped last The output looks like a specification. The number of tests here is 2, not 3, because the outer closure is not a test with two tests inside it but a description clause with two tests inside it. You could write a reporter that shows these specification-style results as a tree that can have the various branches opened and closed, which is I think what you're really after. To me conceptually it is fuzzy to say you can nest a test inside another test. If an inner test fails, does that mean all the enclosing outer tests fail too? It isn't clear. The other thing I heard you mention as a deficiency in JUnit's runner is that tests need to have unique names. (I'm not sure that's true of JUnit but I'll take your work on it.) ScalaTest's runner does not require that tests have unique names, but Suite does. The reason is it allows you to run just one test by providing its name. So while I think the runner needn't have this requirement, I think it is useful to ask a suite of tests to run just one test, and a unique name requirement facilitates that.

    <body>I may be wrong, but it sounds like this project will be a JUnit "engine" geared specifically for IntelliJ. Is there any chance that the core functionality could be written in a way that other tools could leverage it's design.  It would be great if the project would be broken into a core with modules per IDE.  I think this paradigm would benifit the project in the following ways: -- Adoption may slow if every developer were forced into a specific IDE to gain access to this tool. -- Integration with common tools like Ant, Maven, and other CI tools might be harder if too much design is IntelliJ specific. -- I want to use it, but prefer eclipse for no other reason then, "I'm lazy". Sound like a great project, a refactoring of the @RunWith would be a nice-ity.  If you head the eclipse route, I'd be willing to give it a try and supply feed back. Big Mike</body>

    <body>Mike Forsberg wrote on 13.9.2010 22:39: My examples just relate to IntelliJ because that's my IDE of choise. CTR4J isn't meant to be IDE specific. It's meant to be something that every development tool can use. CTR4J will probably be organized into three modules: one with the API for testing frameworks (with a strong backwards compatibility policy), another with code for launching the test runs (for use in build tools and IDEs), and a reference UI for showing the test results (for use in IDEs or as a stand-alone application). Regarding the reference UI, there are a couple of options that I've thought about: One option is to provide a UI which could be embedded into the IDEs. IntelliJ and NetBeans use Swing, so they could use the same implementation, but Eclipse's SWT would require some rework. The IDE architectures are quite different, so it might be problematic to provide good integration for every IDE with just one UI implementation. Some IDEs might choose to use the reference UI implementation as just a reference and make their own UI (hopefully with improvements and without bugs). Another option is for CTR4J to have an external UI. The test runner will anyways run as a separate process (similar to Scala's compile server, fsc) which does things like classloader caching to speed up test runs (at least the classes of all libraries can be cached - maybe also module or package level caching of unmodified classes in large projects possible). It would be possible to have a UI which connects to the test runner server(s) running on the local machine and shows the results of current and recent test runs. This option would work also for test runs started by Ant, Maven etc. It would to some degree work also for IDEs, with the (quite serious) limitations that it would be in a different window as the IDE and code navigation from test results to source code would not work. Maybe implementing both options is the best option. One more thing: To speed up tool support, I'm planning on creating a JUnit adapter so that CTR4J can be launched using the tools' existing JUnit integration. This should be possible with a custom JUnit runner which starts CTR4J which in turn finds the tests and runs them (although it might be necessary for the user to manually tell CTR4J that which directory contains the compiled test classes).

    <header>JUnit Test Result Format" (XML): No evolution for years?</header>
    <body>Hi, the "junit result format" introduced by the ant project is a defacto standard to exchange test result data between test runners and build servers / IDE - not limited to java. Today it is used in many other programming languages (e.g. PHPUnit, etc.). The same is true for ant, which is not limited for using in a specific programming language, too. I saw a lot of discussions in the past years on how to extend the "old xml" to fit the current needs at the ant wiki:  I think it is time to start the evolution of the "junit result format" to came up with its ubliquitously. I think the "next version" of the "junit result format specification" should focus to be language generic to full fill its current role. The above wiki page should be splitted in things related to: 1) the xml evolution 2) the test runner* 3) the test result xml printer* 4) the result xml consumer (IDEs, build servers) *=of the unit test framework used for your favorit programming language Essential to have success on the big goal we should not try to create a complete new format. It must have a backward compatibility, which leads into extending the current version (add elements and attributes, but not removing old ones). At the moment there is no official DTD/Schema available for validation, so it is supposable that most apps are tolarant to new xml elements. Some goals outlined in the above proposials can not be reached that way (e.g. be streamable) - but going this way makes the software industry able to perform a soft migration to the new format. I personally would like to see a xml element (e.g. "notice") for skipped or incompleted (not jet fully implemented) test, which are in fact not "errors" and not "failure"(s).

    <body>I've personally ran into issues in the past where specific features in JUnit 4.x would fail to generate XML output using Ant's XMLJUnitResultFormatter, maybe due to the ant task's failure.  (I think I recall these issues related to the @Expected annotation, but it has been a while and quite a few revisions of both systems..) For those who are unaware, I believe that the system generating the xml under discussion is currently being produced by a specific formatter in the JUnit task in Ant.  Yes, it is very common to use this formatter, as many CI tools consume it as input for test status.  kdefs/optional/junit/XMLJUnitResultFormatter.java My questions are these, is JUnit responsible for this specification?

    <body>Hi Esko, thanks for the link. I see some similarities of your link and my link (to the wiki page). It would be nice if you can figure out what of your thoughts about improving the "output format" is currently NOT listed in the wiki page. Please add it to the page (create a login). "Nested tests" is a big thing that is not supported by the actual specification. Some result printer like PHPUnit creating "JUnit test result xml" can output nested tests (but that is in fact not a original JUnit test result xml). I do not know a single IDE that can display nested tests. With the next version of that "specification" i hope me can push the IDE developers a little bit - would be interesting to see what IDE wins the innovation race (first to the market). It would be nice if you start with the xml, because it is most important if you want to make the new features available to a wide range of "xml consumers" (build servers / IDEs). Apache License 2.0 is a good choice for the next version of the specification, too. To keep it compatible to the existing projects (license) that uses the JUnit actual format. A reference implementation of a: a) result printer b) result consumer would boost the acceptance of a new version of this specification. Hope to see you soon at that front. ;-) I will take care about the xml evolution and on keeping the discussion continuing. I think to enable the PHPUnit to fit to the new version of the specification can be done by me, too. Best regards Daniela Waranie</body>

    <body>Hi Mike, thanks for your post. It seams that the 'specification', that was introduced by the ant team, is not maintained anymore by the ant team. It seams that the 'specification' was a one time ejection of the ant team. I think (but iÂ´m not sure) that no one is responsable at the moment. I agree to David Saff that the JUnit team is not responsable for the 'specification'. I strongly want to move the 'unit test result format' to the next level. I think my next step should be to contact the ant team as they are the legal 'copyright owner' (in the open source meaning) of the XMLJUnitResultFormatter code. The XMLJUnitResultFormatter code (and related documents) are the only 'official source' of the 'specification'. I will ask them if the support my idea and how to continue.

I prefer to start step-by-step (feature-by-feature) and if we have a significant count of features we should release it as next version. The remaining feature request are then the job for the version 3 of that specification. I do not want the community to wait for 2 more years for release 2.0. So a combined workflow would be good. A good process can be to collect the ideas (for not more than 14 days). Then review and summarize it. And start a voting to collect what feature is most desired by the community. After voting we should define, how the xml should look like to handle that feature. This can happen while you are creating the reference implementation.

    <body>Hi Exko, process is clear, fine. Next good question is about, where should the discussion takes place, i agree. I am in contact which inventor of TestNG, CÃ©dric Beust. CÃ©deric is interested in this topic and he contacted me to tell me what he thinks about a new format/version. He agrees that the format should be maintained and it should be guarnateed that the format is maintained on its full life cycle. He stated that the JUnit team can be a good choice. I think that we will never get a guarantee. As you can see in the past, even a big player like the apache software foundation can not guarantee that each projects is maintained forever. I think the guarantee is not the point. When ever someone is interessed in bringing the project to the next step it can be done (event-driven evolution) ;-) Stefan Bodewig, one of the initial authors of the XMLJUnitResultFormater, contacts me to tell me his ideas, too. He stated that it should be developed on 'neutral ground' and should stay language-agnostic. At the moment it feels like a specification team come up around me. The team members comes / should come from the ant team and the JUnit team, and from many other projects and programming languages that uses the 'old format'. The more i think about it, it comes to my mind, that a 'neutral ground' looks like to be the best biological nutrient media to ensure that the next format version is language-agnostic. My thanks goes to: - the ant team for inventing the format - the JUnit team for not at least borrowing the inoffical name for the format (that does not realy have a name jet) - commonly called "JUnit format". It is aaske strategic decision to d the big player (apache ant / JUnit) to give its name to the xml project or to forc with a new name. To call the next version e.g. 'JUnit test result format 2.0' can be a good choice to be recognized. To become more language-agnostic a renaming to a different name can be better - but i am not sure. It depends on the community. Is the community conservative (name keeping) or progressive (renaming). I am not sure. I am a practitioner, so the format should at first fits your needs and the other things can be done by-the-way (maybe someone with experience in strategic desicions can point me here). At the moment it sounds good to rename it. I would call it TRUE format, where TRUE stands for "Test Results Universal Exchange" format - not at least because a lot assertions should become true to make the developer happy. Just my to cents. What does the community think: 1) Where to place the project? a) At a big player? b) Independent? 2) Keep the name or rename it? a) keep it (make the inofficial name an official name) b) rename it Best regards Daniela Waranie</body>

    <header>Fwd: Writing a test fixture for a set of many classes</header>
    <body>Hey everyone! I am currently developing a course scheduler for universites in Java. My team and me chose test driven development, espcially for the scheduler itself. I am using JUnit. For nearly every class there has to be JUnit test class. The database schema has become quiet big. Not everything is needed for the OR-mapped classes in the scheduler. In the end there are still 14 classes. As the scheduler has to be highly configurable, we need classes like: courses, lecturers, students, features, rooms, roomRequiredFeatures, timeSlot, lecturerPrefferredTimeSlots, and so on. I wanted to use the @Before annotations to create fixtures (instantiated test objects to test). These test objects reflect one example of a data set from the database. As a matter of fact, the 14 classess are not very detailed: maybe 3-4 fields. The problem arises as they are bound really tight to each other. THis results in 220 lines code of instanation in the @Before method which is way to much. A common way to deal with this is to write mockups, which simulate the test objects behaviour. But as the classes are very simple there is no way to simulate them. I am a little bit desperate because I have the feeling our design is flawed. Are there any suggesstions or course of actions for this case? I hope I made myself clear, Best regards!</body>

    <body>Konrad, I don't know enough about your design to critique it, yet, but I'm familiar with the things that can happen if you try to run all your tests against One Big Concrete Example, as you seem to be doing. Usually, in these cases, I recommend that a developer try to custom-build their data in each test, using only what they need.  For example, although a single lecturer, single class, and two rooms isn't enough to test every available case, it's probably enough to feed to a simple room-assignment test, etc. In this case, if I find myself making the same chain of calls over and over, I sometimes write convenient factory methods in my test class, so my tests can look like: 102: 20 seats")) Good luck,</body>

    <body>Konrad, Let's keep the discussion on the list, so others can contribute. It's just a plain old Java class that you write for yourself with the convenience methods you need. Yes and no.  In general, I've seen bad things happen if my tests call external methods that are designed for other purposes, but _happen_ to give me the data or behavior I need to set up the method I really want to test.  They tend to get changed later, to suit their intended purposes, leaving the tests broken and sad. However, if the "external" method in question is something you write for yourself, to kill what would otherwise be duplicated between the tests, or stuffed into a setUp method, I've seen few pitfalls. Some people seem to get a lot of mileage out of this, but it seems that the payoffs come when for some reason, CSV files are easier to edit or understand than data right there in the code.  I've heard three reasons for this: 1) The people writing the tests are different than the developers. (Fair enough, but JUnit's a celebration of developers testing their own code) 2) Data files are easier to change than code.  (I rarely find myself wanting to add a bunch of tests without changing _something_ about the test code or the code being tested, so this is an imaginary benefit for me.) 3) The code required to set up the data is convoluted (I consider that a challenge to make the code simpler). I consider trying to apply a generic data-parser to issues in test abstraction to be replacing one problem with two.  Others have taken different views.</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Another question about a JUnit test</header>
    <body>While I think that it can be useful to express certain other kinds of dependencies between tests, this seems to be of the worst kind. When one unit test creates state that is needed by another test, we have true dependency, something we generally try to avoid. Not good guidance for those getting started AFAIC. When what is being tested by a test is a prerequisite for certain other tests we have a dependency that may be worth noting. But that's another thing entirely.

    <header>Re: catch failure to take screenshot with selenium</header>
    <body>We implemented something similar, and in the end we wrote a custom runner, so we could be sure that every test that failed would generate a screenshot, before the @After/@AfterClass methods were called. We also had a bit of code wrapping our Selenium class, that would take a screenshot whenever any method threw an exception (and re-threw the exception).  So we got screenshots in mid test as well. - James</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Another question about a JUnit test</header>
    <body>Charlie, I'm not sure I see the difference between these two cases. When a test depends on another test, it's usually because it needs state created by that previous test. It's a very common need in integration testing, pretty easy to handle and no obvious reason why you should avoid it. Here's a relevant how Selenium relies on this kind of dependencies to create robust tests that don't need to recreate expensive states all the time. -- CÃ©dric On Thu, Aug 26, 2010 at 3:50 PM, Charlie Poole -- CÃ©dric</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Another question about a JUnit test</header>
    <body>Hi CÃ©dric, I distinguish three different sorts of dependency... 1. Test B depends on state created by Test A. 2. Tests A depends on some underlying functionality f1 and B depends on f1 plus some additonal functionality f2. In this situation, it's fairly common for folks to say that B depends on A, but it isn't strictly true. 3. Given that Test A failed, test B will not give any further useful information. In general, case 1 implies cases 2 and 3 and case 2 implies case 3, but not the reverse. A key difference between case 1 is seen if we run Test B by itself - assuming the code is correct of course. For case 1, B will fail but for cases 2 and 3 it will pass. In unit testing, we generally seek to avoid case 1. It's often needed in customer tests and in system testing in general. I was talking about unit testing and I think that's what the thread was about. "Integration" testing means different things to different people so I may agree with you on that count - or not. OTOH, case 2 and 3 exist in the wild and we can do nothing to avoid them. We can only decide whether to express them. As tool designers we can decide whether to allow them to be expressed. Unfortunately, I can't think of a way to allow expressing cases 2 and 3 without also permitting users to fall into the error (I think it's almost always an error in unit testing) of setting up case 1. Usually they do this because of a desire to (prematurely) optimize their tests. Charlie 2010/8/27 CÃ©dric Beust â &amp;lt;cedric@...&amp;gt;:</body>

    <body>Hello, Thanks for your replies. A custom runner seems a good way to go. But what about this: I copied most of the ExternalResource rule and added a catch to handle the errors. I moved the initialization of selenium to before(), the termination to after(), and I take the screenshot and rethrow the error on handleError(Throwable). It works for me, but I'm not sure if this is nice coding. I preferred the @After and @Before annotations.

Good luck,  I'm using a custom Test Runner which filters the tests and only runs the ones that have the custom Annotation.  The problem I'm having is that some classes have 0 tests with the custom Annotation.  When that happens, the class still shows up in the report but lists 0 tests.  I'd prefer to only have a report with the tests that had the special Annotation, ie the ones that actually ran.  Is there a way to exclude the others from the report?  I'm using Ant's junitreport task to generate the report.</body>

    <body>Without contradicting David, I'll say just the opposite :-) The order of execution of tests is not guaranteed. Period. If you'd like, I can go into the philosophy of this, but that's the specification. Now, there's specification and then there's implementation (this is where the "not contradicting" part kicks in). Until JUnit Max, all of the test runners I know of were implemented so that tests ran in declaration order. This is an artifact of implementation, though, and there's power in being able to re-order tests. Regards, Kent example below ( from the web ...): TestCalculatorSubtraction.class ?

    <body>This means that for some reason the Java VM that is running your unit tests exited before all tests finished.  The reason could be a crash in your VM (like an OutOfMemoryError) or something in your code calling System.exit - for example. It is not too likely that the problem is within Ant (Ant's user list would have been the better forum to ask this question, BTW) but rather within your tests.  1.7.1 may have fixed a bunch of things, and so has Ant 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 which have been released later. This may lead to all sorts of problems but shouldn't make your forked VM crash. I'd add a formatter that is pretty verbose ("plain" will do) and make sure the output goes to Ant's logging system as well as to a file.

    <header>Common Test Runner for JVM</header>
    <body>I'll soon start writing a new test runner - a common test runner for the JVM, codename CTR4J. It will provide a superset of JUnit's test runner's features, while at the same time overcoming some of JUnit's limitations and helping integration with development tools. I would like to hear your opinions on this project. MOTIVATION JUnit's test runner - especially the org.junit.runner.RunWith annotation - has been very successful in providing a common interface for running tests from multiple testing frameworks. If a testing framework provides a org.junit.runner.Runner implementation, every Java build tool and IDE will automatically support the framework. However with the rise of Scala testing frameworks (Specs, ScalaTest, Specsy - the last one being written by me), some limitations of JUnit's test runner are coming to the fore: - JUnit makes an implicit assumption that all tests are known before any test code is executed. For example IntelliJ IDEA calls Runner.getDescription() before calling Runner.run() and has problems if the descriptions change during test execution. But in the Scala testing frameworks, in order to achieve a concise syntax, test declarations are implemented as method calls in the class constructor, which means that at least some of the test code must be executed before it is known that what tests there are. - JUnit doesn't know the concept of nested tests. It knows the concept of suites containing suites, but not "test methods" which contain other "test methods". But at least Specs and Specsy allow organizing tests into unlimitedly nested closures. For them this limitation means that IDEs are not able to show the right mental model of what is really happening during test execution, which makes understanding test output harder. - There is an implicit assumption that test names are the same as method names, and that the tests are implemented as methods. For example in IntelliJ IDEA it's possible to navigate from the test results into test methods. But with the Scala frameworks this is not possible, because the test names to not correspond any method declaration (and a string search is not 100% reliable because the test name could be generated dynamically or there could be multiple tests with the same name; at least Specsy allows duplicate names). There are also some other limitations which affect all Java testing frameworks: - When a test prints something, IntelliJ IDEA collects what is printed to stdout and stderr, so that when you select a test in the test results, it will show only what that test printed. This is very useful for debugging with println-statements. But because there is no synchronization between the test runner and the IDE which reads the stdout/err, IDEA doesn't always associate what a test printed with the correct test, especially when the tests are very fast. - No built-in support for executing the tests in parallel. Third-party tools are needed for it. Possibly because of being faced with the above limitations, at least Specs, ScalaTest and TestNG have implemented their own test runners. This in turn means that the IDEs need to support each test runner individually, which results in varying levels of quality and features between the integration with different test runners. For example, at least some time ago, IDEA's Scala plugin did not support automatically finding all Specs tests in the project and executing them. There is also code duplication inside and between all IDEs, build tools and CI servers because they have had to write code to keep track of the test execution state, and that needs to be repeated for each test runner. THE PROJECT I'll soon start writing a test runner to solve the above mentioned limitations and to ease the integration with build tools, IDEs, CI servers etc. The license will be Apache License 2.0. I'm also thinking of making this not only open source, but also "open development", by screencasting similar to What the test runner will provide to testing frameworks, is a superset of the features provided by these JUnit classes: RunWith, Runner, Description, RunNotifier. The API will be a bit more generic and with new abstractions, in order to support for example nested tests. What the test runner will provide to IDEs, build tools and CI servers, is a library for launching the tests in a new VM instance, monitoring the test execution status, collecting the test results and what was printed to stdout/err etc. The tools just need to configure the classpath and choose which tests to run (e.g. using file name patters). I will also provide a reference implementation of an UI for running the tests, because running tests as part of the TDD cycle is too important a feature for its usability to be left in the hands of programmers without interaction design skills. What the test runner will provide to users, is running tests from all testing frameworks (which support this runner or JUnit's test runner) in one suite, running them in parallel on multiple CPU cores (I'll tackle parallelization over multiple machines as a separate project, probably as a commercial tool), integration with every development tool on the JVM (I intend to contact all tool vendors and gather requirements from them to ease the integration) and reliability (backwards compatiblity is very important to me, and I plan on making it possible for each tool vendor to write integration tests, which will be run as part of the test runner's development builds, to detect any breaking changes). So, I would like to ask for your opinion on this project. Here are some questions: - Do you find this useful? - If you had the possibility to rewrite JUnit's test runner, without having to think about backwards compatibility, what would you do differently? @RunWith's javadoc says: "We added this feature late in development. While it seems powerful we expect the runner API to change as we learn how people really use it. Some of the classes that are currently internal will likely be refined and become public." - What do you think would be a good name for the project? One suggestion is CTR4J (actually named similar to SLF4J) which is googleable, but perhaps not very pronounceable or memorable. - What would be a good name for the annotation which corresponds @RunWith? Its name needs to be different to be googleable and to make it easy to annotate a class with both JUnit's and this test runner's annotation. - Any other thoughts? -- Esko Luontola www.orfjackal.net</body>

    <header>JUnit in the Maven repository (was Re: Future of JUnit &amp;amp; Hamcrest)</header>
    <body>Hi, I use JUnit exclusively via Maven. From the Maven user's perspective, it would actually be for the best if *only* the junit-dep jar had ever been uploaded to the Maven repository - remember, Maven resolves dependencies, so when junit-dep is referenced, it will also pull in hamcrest-core 1.1. The issue is as follows: Maven will only put one version of any given groupId+artifactId on the classpath. Since junit is present both as junit:junit and junit:junit-dep, it's far too easy for a project that, say, depends on junit itself, and also uses jmock's junit4 integration (which declares a dependency on junit-dep) to end up with BOTH junit and junit-dep on its classpath.... potentially of different versions. Personally, I think there's a pretty solid rationale to decide to back-fill the missing junit-dep uploads, and decide to never upload any new versions of the junit jar with hamcrest, so that Maven users will gradually migrate to using a single Maven artifactId for JUnit.

    <header>Now comes Zephyr v3.0</header>
    <body>Hello Everyone, Zephyr has been a leader in comprehensive test management and now with Zephyr v3.0, Zephyr is changing the landscape by introducing quality intelligence to test management. We are pleased to inform you that Zephyr has come out with its new and enhanced version Zephyr v3.0 comprehensive test management. What's New in Zephyr v3.0? Custom reports generator: Zephyr's new custom report generator makes it simple for every team to be able to run any report they need. The new functionality builds on the existing out of the box functionality which comes with more than 16 drill down reports and metrics. Extensive API's: Zephyr's philosophy has always been to integrate with existing infrastructure and not force teams to rip one tool out to replace it with another. With the new extensive API's Zephyr further extends the capability of its platform to support the myriad needs of global software quality teams. The web services API's are fully documented at Enhanced productivity levels/Search Technology: Zephyr's test management solution promotes a new level of organization at the release, project, department and global level. With the 3.0 release, Zephyr debuts a new search technology that searches in the body of fields, not just in the title or subject field. Teams will achieve new levels of productivity Trend reporting: With Zephyr's new, first of its kind dynamic trend reports, teams now have the ability to look back at stages of former projects and quantify how long it took to complete the release. With this information in hand, the same teams will now able to plan accordingly for not only current releases, but also for future projects. Enhanced JIRA integration: Zephyr enhances its one of a kind 2-way JIRA integration by supporting JIRA custom fields. Teams have always been able to enter, search, change, report, analyze and close any defect in JIRA from within Zephyr through optimized testing desktops. With the new release, teams who have customized or plan to customize JIRA will also be able to leverage the robust functionality and achieve higher productivity and efficiencies. We'd love to hear your opinion about Zephyr v3.0 and will be glad to share more information with you. Online help is available at</body>

    <body>David, thanks for the explanations. Please, pick one of the many volunteers and work with him/her to automate deployment to Maven Central. This will literally save 1000's of wasted hours for devs around the globe. (As someone else already stated, there is zero practical chance of breaking someone's build when deploying a new release version.) Meanwhile I've deployed the latest release versions of junit/junit-dep to my own Maven repo: build that will continually build and deploy the latest (4.9) snapshots to this repo. Hopefully this will help some people who, like me, can't wait any longer for the latest JUnit versions to appear in Maven Central. The repo also hosts Hamcrest 1.2, another important (and related) lib that isn't available from Central. Cheers, Peter future JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest? with Hamcrest 1.2?</body>

    <body>Cedric, Good points. 1. I'm not used to the @BeforeClass. I will make that change, as it is a better fit. 2. The assigning of nulls is just to emphasize cleaning up after yourself. I agree that it's technically unnecessary. 3. Let me think about the parameterized thing. I think for eight values, with their descriptive names, it brings more value leaving them as they are, although I may change where they are defined. Thank you for you considered points.

    <header>Re: More example JUnit code</header>
    <body>Simon, Actually, I was wrong: using @BeforeClass will break your tests. Since JUnit reinstantiates a brand new class before each test method, only the first method will get the correct values for these fields. Subsequent methods will see null. Anyway, these values are constants, so they should be static final. Which solves the problem and also gets rid of @Before and @After. About the fields: what bothers me with this approach is that you're exposing a lot of fields to all your test methods and they only use a very small subset of these. In effect, fields are like global variables and they make it harder for someone coming to improve your class to understand exactly what fields are okay to modify and which tests need to be updated as well. I like to keep the data needed by each test method as local as possible to avoid this kind of problem. Parameterized tests help a lot with this kind of locality, and they turn out to be a great match for this particular problem. With all this in mind, here is my version (TestNG syntax, porting to JUnit is left as an exercise to the reader): result You can probably see how parameterized tests improve the locality of your tests and how adding values to extend the coverage is trivial. Also note that this is a great example of how misleading code coverage can be: you would get 100% test coverage if you only returned 1 data set in each data provider, but your tests would be very poor. Adding values to your data provider will do nothing for your code coverage but it will considerably improve the quality of your tests. -- CÃ©dric -- CÃ©dric</body>

    <header>Re: More example JUnit code</header>
    <body>Leaving aside the JUnit/TestNG specificity, you are simply saying that the reader needs to know what parameterized testing is in order to understand this code. Well, of course. What's the point in introducing this feature in JUnit 4 if you don't believe it's useful? Again, this is a textbook example of what parameterized testing is for. The test *is* the data, not the code. Making it possible to extract that data out of the code has a lot of value that you might not see as a programmer but that QA organizations everywhere absolutely love. I cannot tell you how many TestNG users (and JUnit too I bet) are using Excel spreadsheets to drive their tests thanks to data providers. The mental indirection is just "know the tool you are working with". The cost in violating DRY is a brittle code base. I'm pretty sure the code you posted would not pass code review where you work :-) -- Cédric</body>

I hope you actually can tell me.  I hope you have numbers, because that would be interesting.  Are you suggesting that Simon should be driving his tests of a rational number class with an Excel spreadsheet? I'll leave that up to the opinion of the reader. If you really want to go there, please show me a believeable change in the Fraction class that would have a high cost in Version B.  Don't Repeat Yourself is an important principle that needs to be rationally applied, not brandished like a talisman that precludes further discussion. That's an easily verifiable proposition.  I'll run it by a couple of my colleagues.  Let me know if there's anyone in particular you think I should ask.</body>

  <mail>
    <header>Re: More example JUnit code</header>
    <body>Again: if adding new test cases is more about adding data than it is about adding code, then your code is data driven and probably a good fit for parameterized testing. It's a pretty simple Litmus test, really. Suppose that after this, you implement a ComplexFraction class that implements fractions for complex numbers. Interestingly, your test code will *not* change. Multiplication testing will be the same for real and complex numbers: @Test What will change is the data that you will pass to this test method. Thanks to polymorphism, your code will be exactly the same but the data set will be completely different. This is one of the reasons why it makes sense to *extract* that data set out of the test logic. Hence parameterized testing. What if the Fraction constructor suddenly needs one more parameter? You'll find yourself having to replace all the new Fraction(1, 1) that litter your code. With a constant, it would be a one line change. Frankly, I'm puzzled I have to justify the importance of using constants. That sounds fun. Anyone on the Java readability will do. I hope they won't let me down :-) To be realistic, the test class should test the entire spectrum of operations that a fraction class would offer (reduce, multiply, divide, add, etc...) because hopefully, this would make you realize how much repetition your version actually generates, but I understand if you don't want to waste too much time on this. -- Cédric</body>

    <header>Re: More example JUnit code</header>
    <body>2010/8/23 CÃ©dric Beust â &amp;lt;cedric@...&amp;gt;: I can easily see that there are testing problems that justify the additional complexity of parameterized testing.  Can you see that there are testing problems that do not justify that complexity? Precisely the opposite.  Version B will involve a single change in the f() method, and Version A will require changes in all the new Fraction(1, 1) that litter _it's_ code, including all those constants. Review the actual code we're talking about. Again, constants are a tool, to be used in the right place.  If you can't think of a way that a tool can be overused, you're probably overusing it. Posted.  I'll let you know. For every operation, Version-B style coding will produce more than twice as much code as Version A.  There's no economy of scale to be had at all in Version B.  I agree that extending the example is a waste of time--it will produce no new answers.</body>

    <header>Re: More example JUnit code</header>
    <body>Cedric: I actually got that to work. I did have to declare the variables as static, but that didn't bother me. I might even declare them final and skip the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass completely. As for the rest of the discussion which I really wish I could follow during the day, but have to wait until I get home in the evening, I like the idea of trying the more test driven approach. Not totally convinced that'll work in this example, but worth a try. Also, I'm trying to get up to speed on the new Theories as they might fit some of the invariant nature of the mathematics involved with fractions. (I'm still stuck in a timewarp back at JUnit 4.0) (As an aside, this is why I teach JUnit using simple objects, because then the object is simple enough to fade into the background, leaving just the unit testing principles and approaches to be mentally wrangled.) David: on first inspection, I found your code to be very terse. This is a good thing in some situations, but this code was/is designed for teaching and that's why I created variables with names like oneHalf and threeFifths, so that the lines of code would read better. There's method to my madness! I like the concept of valuing more than just code coverage in our tests and the thought of domain coverage through well chosen test data is an appealing one. I'll give that some more thought. Thank you for a most interesting discussion. Simon -- simonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org</body>

    <body>task is to write test case without changing the source code. The provided solution may be an option provided I can change the source code. Please guide me to get through this test case. First, something you probably don't want to hear.  You've been asked to take code that hard-codes an assumption that it's being run inside a web container, and run it outside a web container.  You may want to talk to whoever's assigning this task (even if it's yourself), and see if the tradeoff of the extra work you'll have to do, and the design you won't be able to improve, is worth the benefit of not changing the source code. That said, you can probably hack something together using a custom classloader, and use that classloader to load your class.  Generalist Java forums may be your best source of information on how to do this.

    <header>jsystem parametrized and junit</header>
    <body>Hi, I am new with junit. I am trying, for a week, to solve a problem of junit and jsystem working simultaneously. I work with jsystem 5.5.4. The version of junits that comes with this jsystem is 4.4. I tried to make parameterized test in jsystem but I did not succeed. In parameterized test, only one constructor should exist. This constructor will take the parameters.  But for jsystem reflection I need an empty constructor. If  I have 2 constructors the Junit will fail in the function : getOnlyConstructor(). If I use only the parametric constructor it will failed in jsystem GUI because it can not build this class. Do anybody has an idea what can solve this problem? Can I upgrade the junit version for the jsystem or does the jsystem will have problems with the upgraded  junit. Thanks Lee</body>

    <body>Lee, In the current implementation of parameterized test, there's no meaning for a test object that is constructed without constructor parameters.  So you could remove the restriction, but I'm not sure whether it would allow your tests to run, or what they would do if you did.  Is JSystem open source?  I think that redirecting JSystem to use the JUnit running infrastructure would be the best win, since that would allow all JSystem users to use all JUnit classes, rather than hand-hacking individual class runners in JUnit to workaround JSystem's quirks. to me yet.... parametrized test?

    <header>Meaningful descriptions for parameterized test cases (patch submission)</header>
    <body>I'd like to get some feedback about a patch I 've submitted to  contain more information extracted from the parameters, test name, etc.  See also issue  #135 project. The reason for this change is that in my team, we have a problem that when using parameterized tests, JUnit reports do not display the parameters of the test case or even the test class, but rather cryptic [0], [1], [2] for each run of the fixture and methodName[0], methodName[1], etc. for the actual test case runs.  In order to understand what fails, we need to lookup the actual parameters in the sources, which is annoying. The new feature works by allowing one to specify fixtureDescription and testDescription patterns to the Parameters annotation. This has the benefit that the formatting is kept close to the data and the default values are chosen to be backwards compatible, so there is no impact to the users that choose not to specify the patterns. Check Javadoc for details.</body>

    <body>future JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest? Yes, having made this decision, we'll stick to it until convinced it's doing more harm than good. Unfortunately, the last time we looked at the typing changes in Hamcrest 1.2, we found that we couldn't automatically upgrade people without changing compiling tests into non-compiling tests, and, if I remember, in a few pathological cases, passing tests into failing tests.  We guessed that of people who used the hamcrest features bundled with JUnit, there were more that would be hurt by a version change than would be helped by it, so we've stayed here. Hamcrest 1.2? junit-dep has been up on github for every release.  Whoever has been putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn't been also putting up junit-dep?  I'm sorry to say that I'm very aware that a lot of people are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who'd been keeping the maven repos up-to-date until several months ago.  I've been reluctant to accept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor fully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in a way that broke all their tests.  This might be overly cautious of me.</body>

They have to manually select to use the new version that has just appeared in the repo, and this way if their tests start failing, they will know that they can either fix them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the previous version. I am considering of taking up on this task with pushing junit to the public Maven repo, but I have to first learn what is exactly the process for this (perhaps signing up at Apache as contributor, or smt).

    <header>Re: Re: Future of JUnit &amp;amp; Hamcrest</header>
    <body>You won't be able to push SNAPSHOT versions of anything on the main Maven repository. That's by design (and it's a good design decision). You can push these to a special snapshot repository and then ask your users to add three lines to their pom so that Maven will query that snapshot repository. That's a good middle ground solution that I've used a few times with TestNG. As for pushing to a Maven repository, it's quite straightforward now and you can now do it yourself (you no longer need to file a ticket and have someone from Maven do the push for you). You don't need to be a member of Apache either. Once you deploy to Nexus, it takes about an hour before it becomes available on Maven central. -- Cédric -- Cédric</body>

    <body>I am having a problem where the JUnit 4 runner isn't waiting for the @BeforeClass method to finish before running some of the tests contained within the class.  I am running the tests via a webservice which calls an EJB which calls JUnitCore.run(Class[])(I have also tried JUnitCore.run(Runner)).  I put a log statement at the end of the BeforeClass method and added a listener to the core to log when a test starts to figure this out.

The behavior you report is certainly not how JUnit is supposed to work. @BeforeClass methods are (I thought) guaranteed to be called before any tests in that class are called. Is it possible for you to put logging calls in the test itself as well to verify that this invariant is not holding? As far running all the tests in the same context, I'm afraid I can't help with that. Regards, Kent @BeforeClass method to finish before running some of the tests contained within the class.

    <header>JUnit tests stop working in Eclipse</header>
    <body>Symptoms:  a project in Eclipse 3.5, with which I have been successfully using a JUnit 4 test suite all along.  This morning suddenly when I run a test class with "Run as JUnit Test", Eclipse reports "No JUnit tests found". I can still run individual test methods normally.  The problem happens when I run the test class, and it happens with all test classes in the project, except one.  When I run the entire test directory tree, JUnit executes one of the classes in the middle of the directory tree normally, then stops with no other messages.  I can run that one test class normally.  I can't find any difference between the one that runs and the dozens that don't.  Other projects continue to run JUnit normally.  Eclipse clean, refresh, and validate does not help. Closing and opening the project does not help.  Deleting the project from disk and checking it out again from my Subversion repository does not help.  When I drop back to a revision from a few days back, all works correctly.  But I want to save and test my work since then. This sounds like Eclipse metadata got corrupted, and it sounds like the corrupted metadata gets saved to Subversion.  I haven't been able to identify an event or a change in my project that led to this problem. What metadata might be involved?  If I try deleting Eclipse metadata directories, what is safe to throw away? Thanks for any suggestions.</body>

    <header>JUnit mailing list etiquette</header>
    <body>Once again, it's time for a little reminder of some of the finer points of JUnit mailing list etiquette. This will be posted now and then; not often enough to be spam, but often enough to keep our newer members aware of how we conduct business around here. Dear members and readers of the JUnit mailing list, Around here, we love testing. Not only do we love testing, we love to discuss any and all aspects of testing, often with enthusiasm and passion. This is good. This is the reason that this mailing list exists. On top of all this, we are very keen to help others understand this strange affliction we have; medical name "testus infectus", better known as being test infected. We love to answer questions and help those new to the joy move further down the road towards test enlightenment. In the classic spirit of hospitality, our list is your list, our test cases are your test cases. Please make yourself at home and enjoy the journey. :-) That said, there are some things that we don't love, so sit tight and listen up. We don't love people who haven't, or won't, read the JUnit Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document, lovingly maintained by Mike Clark or the "Smart Questions" document written and maintained by Eric S. Raymond. Here are the links, go forth and read ...  We don't love people who think that we'll do their homework assignments for them. Back when I was a lad, we didn't have the Internet and we had to do our own homework assignments without the aid of all the knowledge and information that you have available to you today. (And yes, now that you ask, I did walk uphill both ways to school through the snow.) We don't love people who are incapable of using a search engine, but are yet somehow capable of signing up onto this mailing list so that they can ask questions that ten seconds of searching would reveal the answer to. Learn how to use a search engine. Around here, Google seems quite popular. Here's a link; learn to love it and use it.  We don't love job postings. We do love having jobs (or at least, we like the pay) and we do like to look at job postings, but we like to look at them in more logical places like job websites. So, please don't be upset when a moderator deletes your carefully worded prose describing yet another testing job. We don't love thread hijacking. That's when you start a different subject by replying to a previous conversation and not even changing the subject line. We like to discuss a variety of subjects, so please feel free to be inspired to ask side-questions during ongoing conversations. Just do so by starting a fresh thread with a unique subject line. Lastly, we don't love people who whine, moan and generally sound like petulant children after they've been told that they have violated one of the "laws of the land" around here. It's a big old Internet; feel free to take your questions and/or tantrums somewhere else if you don't like the way we do things around here.

    <header>Running Junit tests 'for dummies' tools/etc</header>
    <body>Hey all, I'm having a hard time searching for the right terms to describe what I am looking for, so posting a question here -- Environment: Java 5/6, mixed windows/linux environment (for use-case, assume all Windows desktops), Eclipse IDE for java developers, mix of junit 3.8/4.0 tests, and a LOT of already existing junit tests that include regression/database testing. Scenario: Junit tests already exist and do integration testing to the database backend, including direct SQL queries, hibernate/JPA queries, and stored procedure calls (MS SQL).  People who are non-java/non-junit are going to make changes to the database and stored procedures (for many different projects). Question: Is there an easy way for a non-java/non-junit person to, basically, one-click run unit tests to see if changes they made will cause issues to the existing regression/unit tests?  The ease-of-access and results is the key/critical part, as otherwise they will just keep asking development staff to run them and ask for feedback. Thanks for any tips/ideas/tooling! -dhartford</body>

Why not just run JUnit as a console application / Ant Build or alike? If you want, you can wrap it in a batch-file or something to make it even easier to start.

    <header>Re: Running Junit tests 'for dummies' tools/etc</header>
    <body>Thank you for your feedback.  The current system uses a Maven2 buildsystem. The current deficiency (not in junit, but tooling) is not from a developer running the unit tests, it's from a non-code-developer (i.e. a database person who works with (M$) tools like Query Analyzers/Enterprise managers) verifying their database changes did not impact the current junits without needing a code-developer to 'babysit' watching the unit tests. The CI server would be perfect...if the sql code changes were commited to source control at the same time the TEST database instance was updated, but no source control is committed to trigger the unit tests (i.e. database changes not in source control, or in a different source control system...and generally you try not to commit code until local unit tests pass).  I will think about this one more though as a talking point to move in that direction. Until then, the challenge is still the 'non-developer' to be able to invoke running the unit tests through a GUI they (a person familiar with M$ GUI screens) can run and understand.  Command-line/console approaches are difficult to get acceptance for external users who are used to their GUI screens :-(</body>

    <header>Re: @BeforeClass method for DBUnit Dataset creation</header>
    <body>That is a compelling story -- thanks for taking the time to tell it. We use a best practice that each test class must have its own independent test data set.  Right now we have only 8 test class and 8 test data sets.  But soon we'll have 50+ test classes and so we'll have 50+ test data sets.  Recall that Spring Test performs a rollback after every test method, so there are no dependencies between tests. In your experience, is one data set per test *class* good enough?  It's unclear from your narrative if you are suggesting one data set per test *method* or just avoiding/minimizing integration testing altogether in favor of unit testing. I have found these DAO integration tests to be extremely helpful, given all the subtleties and magic surrounding Spring and Hibernate.</body>

This allows you to run all of your many, many classes that contain test methods without having to do a ton of bookkeeping to maintain a Suite that explicitly lists these classes.  In this situation, @AfterClass annotations or annotating the Suite class just won't work, since there is no Suite class at all.

    <header>Organizing Tests - Documentation is Conflicting</header>
    <body>Okay, I've been browsing documentation for a while now, and there seems to be a large conflict where approaches have changed between versions. My understanding is that to create a test, I should be doing something along these lines: @Test To add setup and take down, I just make methods that are annotated with @Before and @After. Simple enough. Now, my understanding is that this setup was developed to replace the old practice of making classes that extend TestCase and overriding methods in there to get the same functionality. The one thing that I can't seem to find is how I should be grouping tests like these. Eclipse can run this class's tests for me, and that's all good, but how should I be grouping tests if I want to run all the tests in a project at the same time? I've looked at TestSuite and tried to get it working with classes that use annotations like this, but I can't seem to figure out how it should be done.</body>

    <header>Re: Re: Organizing Tests - Documentation is Conflicting</header>
    <body>Hi Debio, There are several ways of grouping your tests, including using suites. However, the simplest way if you're using Eclipse seems to be like this: 1. Have one folder in your project called "src" for your source code. 2. Have another folder (a sibling of "src") called "junit" or "test" or something like that. Nowadays I am calling mine "junit" because I've ended up with a variety of types of test code in my projects. 3. Under the "junit" folder organize your packages the same way as you would under "src", and keep your test classes and all other related classes here (such as mock classes). 4 In Eclipse, set up a new run configuration that runs all tests in the "junit" folder. This will allow you to execute all tests in your project. If you want to run all the classes in a specific package, you can setup run configurations to do that also. As for the Yahoo Groups things - I thought that at first too. But if you go back into the group there will be a link to Edit Membership, where you can add a new email address and switch where mail is sent to for this group. Good luck! -Dennis</body>

    <header>Re: @BeforeClass method for DBUnit Dataset creation</header>
    <body>Just like PostConstruct, you also have the PreDestroy annotation. Annotating a method with this will allow you to execute code before the respective bean is taken out of the context. More generaly, you could implement (if you don't already have) a Spring bean that is responsible with setting up the test, and then cleaning up when the tests are finished. Having this bean as a Spring singleton ensures that the bean will be created only once, and the initialization + destruction methods will also be called only once. Bogdan problem.  I still need to delete the test data after all the tests have run! The only way to do this is via @AfterClass which, again, forces all my DBUnit code to be static which doesn't work. created a non-static DBUnitHelper class and used Spring to instantiate one of these and inject it into the root class of my test classes.  The DBUnitHelper class uses your approach to ensure the data is only loaded once regardless of how many times it is asked to load it.  Deleting the data from an @AfterClass static method was also simple.  So for now, I am happy. is to do what unitils does and create a custom testexecutionlistener. a great way to load the data just once.  However, you are still left with the cleanup problem.... tests that a and guide than</body>

    <body>Why do we need to use JUnits? If we have to test any new class, we could create a new class, inside that class we could declare a main() method and call the function to be tested with the required arguments.

  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Why to use JUnits?</header>
    <body>Hi dk, Yes, it is possible to write your tests by adding a class with a main method which just calls the function you want to test. However, JUnit provides you with a lot of features which you would end up developing for yourself anyway. For example, you will have many of these "main" methods which will compare the two values (the value which you expect and the actual value from your function). JUnit provides assertEquals methods for you. JUnit also gives you the ability to organize your test cases into test classes and test suites. There are a lot of tools which also utilize JUnit. For example, JUnit is integrated into many popular Java IDEs and works with most continuous integration environments (such as CruiseControl). In other words, if you write all your tests in your own main method, you will probably find yourself, slowly "re-inventing" all the features of JUnit. As JUnit advances, you will be able to take advantage of the new features which the community provides. You also have access to the many other people who use JUnit and who have experience writing unit tests. Good luck, Dennis</body>

It seems much more friendly to use a @AfterSuite than to wire up shutdown hooks, implement a Runnable, etc. What do you think? Thanks, Adam say "Run as...

    <header>Re: Why to use JUnits?</header>
    <body>According to Java, there is only one main method allowed per class. Traditionally, I use more then one method in a given class.  If I were limited to only testing one method at a time, then I would miss a great many methods.  Plus, I have to change the main method to call a different method. However, - if I were to make a very complex main method, that called all of my methods... - - I'd have to maintain this complex main method. - - I'd have to add logic to make sure that all my tests execute, even if the first one threw an exception - if I were to provide arguments to the main method to determine which method to test... - -  I'd still have to call Java multiple times to test all my methods. - in both cases - - I'd have to write assertion logic, that displays expected and actual values, so I can determine what was wrong. Making main method's also corrupts the actual code with methods that are not needed for execution.  Using separate test classes allows for easy removal of test code from your deployment.  If every class is wired tightly to their test code, then how do you strip it out without modifying the code base. If your argument is, why use JUnit if it is just another java program that executes java code.  I see nothing prohibiting one from writing their own test harness...  I personally would want to stay away from such an endeavor, but feel free to try and succeed.  May your time on the project be enjoyable. Big Mike</body>

    <header>Re: Large, hierarchical, randomized test suites: how to not	run out of memory?</header>
    <body>Thanks again for your hints. I have a few problems with your suggestion. First of all, your code is slightly broken (I guess you were typing it off the top of your head). MethodRule.apply() must return a Statement, not void. A correct implementation seems to be the following (at least, that's what I came up with): @Rule @Override public Statement apply(final Statement base, FrameworkMethod method, Object @Override for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1000; i++) Another problem I have is that it turns out my @Before method is executed only once before running all 1000 tests, instead of once before each test. Finally, this approach flattens the test hierarchy. Instead of being able to consult the result of each run of the test method, if any of the runs fails, the whole test suite is interrupted, and the following tests are not run at all. I would like to be able to see the frequency of failure of the test method, and the various ways in which it fails.</body>

    <body>I've thought twice about your initial suggestion to use Theories and DataPoints. Conceptually, this is the functionality that I am looking for. But I don't want to have to instantiate all DataPoints at once. So, I figured out a simple hack: the DataPoints should be fake data points. The only thing that matters is their number. Then, the real (expensive) data points should be instantiated one by one in the @Before method. This looks like the following: @RunWith(Theories.class) @DataPoints @Before // Instantiate the random data points @After // Free resources @Theory // Run the test However, there are still 3 issues with this approach: 1) If TestClass contains multiple Theories, they are all run the same number of times (1000). I don't see how one could easily enforce a specific number of runs for each Theory. 2) JUnit still reports the method testMethod as one entity, instead of breaking it down into 1000 runs, and terminates after the very first failed run. I'd like to have a more detailed report. 3) I am struggling with what appears to be a bug in JUnit when testMethod takes in other (real) data points. Then, regardless of their types, JUnit attempts to feed them with elements of the "runs" array of DataPoints. For instance: @RunWith(Theories.class) @DataPoints @DataPoint @Theory This test fails because JUnit attempts to substitute "used" with runs[0]: org.junit.experimental.theories.internal.ParameterizedAssertionError: testMethod(runs[0], runs[0]) Why is JUnit doing this?

    <header>Re: Large, hierarchical, randomized test suites: how to not	run out of memory?</header>
    <body>In the meantime, I have been experimenting with TestNG, and I am sorry to report that it does a much better job than JUnit at solving my problem. Using TestNG's DataProvider functionality, I was able to quickly get everything I need (and that JUnit hasn't been able to deliver yet): 1) A DataProvider returns an Object[][] that gives, for each run of the test method, the sequence of input parameters for that method. So, to run a parameterless test method 1000 times, you just need to write: @DataProvider (name = "dataProvider") @Test (dataProvider = "dataProvider") // Run the test No need to use the same hack as with JUnit that requires test methods to take in an unused int, like I previously suggested. 2) Even better: if I wanted to pass the data points as inputs to the test method instead of creating them inside the @Before method, TestNG provides a way to create these data points one by one instead of all at once, hereby saving instead of an Object[][]. 3) TestNG reports the results of tests on a data point basis instead of on a method basis, and does not terminate the test method as soon as it fails on a particular data point. This functionality is not available (yet) in JUnit. 4) If there are multiple test methods, It is straightforward to specify the desired number of runs for each method: @DataProvider (name = "dataProvider") if (method.getName().equals("testMethodRequiringEvenMoreRuns"))) 5) Needless to say, TestNG works without bugs when the test method does take in parameters (contrary to JUnit). But you have to manually build the corresponding Object[][] in the DataProvider, while JUnit attempts to automate that for you (and currently fails to do so due to a bug). The only problem I have with TestNG at this point is that the Eclipse plugin is painfully slow and a bit buggy. But this is a problem with the plugin itself, not with TestNG. So, until JUnit meets my needs, I am going to go with TestNG. Thanks again for your support</body>

    <header>@BeforeClass method for DBUnit Dataset creation</header>
    <body>My DAO integration tests are taking a long time to run.  I am using Spring Test which automatically does a transaction rollback after each test method. However, I am also using DBUnit to load the exact same dataset before each test method via the @BeforeTransaction annotation. It has occured to me that I could save a lot of time if I load the DBUnit test data once per test class instead of once per test method. I've not used the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass methods before, but apparently they require the annotated method to be static and this is interfering with my normal use of Spring dependency injection that provides an application context, data source, and other things I need to load the correct data set. Anyone experience this before?  What's a good way to address this problem?</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: @BeforeClass method for DBUnit Dataset creation</header>
    <body>I would advise against that unless you were following the following guide lines.... - No test method (or called method) manipulates the data base. - The order of the test methods do not cause conflicts with each other with required data being there. Some things I'd try before doing the @BeforeClass - Only populate the data you need for a given set of tests.  (Don't populate the _whole_ database.) - Which of the DBUnit population features are you using... I think there is one that will revert to a known state, without the delete and insert.  This may save some time. - Try to use a non-commitable transaction for testing.  After all, one shouldn't need to test the commit functionality.  If that breaks more than just you will have problems. Hope I helped, Big Mike</body>

    <header>Re: @BeforeClass method for DBUnit Dataset creation</header>
    <body>Thanks for the help.  In my case, Spring Test does an automatic transaction rollback after every test method, so there are no dependencies between tests -- so thats not a problem.  Because of the rollback, it is also the case that they order of the test runs also doesn't matter.  The database is reset to a "known" state after each test method by the transactional rollback. I'd just like to load the data once rather than 50 times.  But the @BeforeClass requirement to be a static method makes it impossible to use.   Is there any trigger that can run after a class is initialized by Spring and before any test method is executed?</body>

    <header>Re: Re: @BeforeClass method for DBUnit Dataset creation</header>
    <body>The hack of a initalizationOccurred boolean is always an option. In other words... use a static field that is initially set to false.  Then when you come to your setup method, only do the update if the field is false.  Just remember to set the field to true once the update occurs.  This way, no matter which test runs first or even if a sub set of tests run, then the reset only occurs initially. There may be a better way to do this, but I like to fall back on this recipe.

    <header>Re: @BeforeClass method for DBUnit Dataset creation</header>
    <body>Let me tell you a story. In 2001 I worked on my first XP project at Toyota Canada in Toronto. We ran into exactly the same problem you describe here: we had several dozen tests, most of which inserted data in setUp() and rolled transactions back in tearDown(). Back then, of course, computers ran more slowly, so we were running at around 5-10 tests per second when we were lucky. We could see how when we added another 300 tests our test suite would take several minutes to run, and that just wasn't going to work. We decided to create a single test data set for the entire test suite, then used the tools of the time--DBUnit, in fact--to insert the data set at the start of the test run. For a few weeks, it worked great. Our test suite execution time dropped from minutes to tens of seconds which, back then, we could live with. Then something annoying happened. We added a new feature, which required putting data in a new table, which itself required adding a row to an old table to set up a foreign key relationship. We got the six new tests to run, but when we ran the entire suite just before checkin, 3 tests failed. We discovered that by adding a row to the parent table, we changed the expected result for three of our tests: they used to expect 6 rows, and now they needed to expect 7. We considered two options: split the test data into two sets, or change the expected results in the tests. We figured that the first option would slowly lead us back to loading test data for each test, so we chose the second option and changed the expected results. A couple of weeks later, it happened again. We added a feature that required putting data in a new table, which itself required adding rows to a few different existing tables to set up foreign key relationships. We got the eight new tests run, but when we ran the whole suite, 10 tests failed. We sighed, we checked what happened, and we updated the expected results on the old tests. A week later, it happened again. This time we had to change 26 tests. It took a day to do it accurately, because each "fix" required running an 8-minute test suite, and 26 times 8 is already over three hours. A week later, it happened again. This time we had to change 61 tests. It took three days. We saw where this was going. We split the test data back into sensible datasets, with each test loading the data it needed. Execution time increased, but maintenance time went to almost zero. We also figured out how to test more of the system without touching the database at all. Nowadays, when I work on such a project, only about 20-50 tests touch the database, and the rest run in memory. At today's machine speeds, I usually get 250-500 tests per second. In the ten seconds it takes for my mind to wander, I can run 15,000-30,000 tests. I can build a pretty good system for 15,000 tests. -- J. B. Rainsberger ::</body>

    <header>Re: @BeforeClass method for DBUnit Dataset creation</header>
    <body>I am totally good with hacks!  However, this one still leaves me with a problem. I still need to delete the test data after all the tests have run!  The only way to do this is via @AfterClass which, again, forces all my DBUnit code to be static which doesn't work. In the meantime, I implemented another approach that has seemed to work.   I created a non-static DBUnitHelper class and used Spring to instantiate one of these and inject it into the root class of my test classes.  The DBUnitHelper class uses your approach to ensure the data is only loaded once regardless of how many times it is asked to load it.  Deleting the data from an @AfterClass static method was also simple.  So for now, I am happy. For the record, an alternative (and better) approach I learned about elsewhere is to do what unitils does and create a custom testexecutionlistener. Also for the record, if you annotate a method with @PostConstruct -- it's also a great way to load the data just once.  However, you are still left with the cleanup problem.... Anyway hope all this helps somebody else!</body>

I'd like to see an annotation called @Suite.SuiteTests... where you can add just a specific test. In fact I'll add the issue on GitHub, please vote for it.

    <header>RE: How can we stop executing a test before execution in jUnit....</header>
    <body>This is the type of problem that the Rules package is meant to address. Essentially you would have an object that extends the MethodRule base class, and add that to your test case as a class field marked with the @Rule annotation.  Example: The org.junit.rules.TestWatchman would be a good base to subclass for your purposes.  Do keep in mind that Java will create a new instance of your class for each test run.  Expensive tasks like reading and parsing an Excel spreadsheet will add up quite quickly. Executing the tests through Ant is a no brainer.  Consult Ant related resources for examples.

    <header>Suggestion for new matchers</header>
    <body>Hello, My name is  Mykolas Mickus (in english its Michael). I've just graduated from Kaunas University of Technology (in Lithuania) where I have been studying IT for four years. I've been using Java for 3 years now. First of all I'd like to thank You and all JUnit team for the great testing framework which I've been using since version 4. What I especially like about the version 4 is hamcrest and matchers. They make my tests more readable (and fun) to write. However I've found that JUnit does not have property matchers which would be very usefull in my opinion. While using FlexUnit 4 (Adobe Flex and ActionScript 3 testing framework) I've got used to these property (or object) matchers and now think that similar matchers could be implemented and used in JUnit. Here is an example reasoning the necessity of this feature. Lets say we call 'sellItem()' method on instance of class 'Store'. Then we need to check if properties (migh be set/get pairs or public instance variables) like 'itemsInStock', 'currentStoreValue' or 'itemsSold' have been updated. Currently we could accomplish this in several ways with JUnit: 1) Use assertion methods: 2) With currently available matchers: 3) Creating another instance and comparing the two: The last example is limited because we must have 'equals()' implemented  in correct way and this assertion will *always* check same properties which, probably, means all of them. But what if wee need only a subset? Of course this issue can be addressed by the first two examples. However, things get complicated when we come to collections. The same class 'Store' probably holds a list of all items. Its difficult to check if there is an item with some specific properties values: Again, we need 'equals()' to be implemented correctly and we can't easily match agains a subset of all properties. Needless to say, many lines of code are required when we want to use 'hasItems()' to check even a few items in a collection. Now here is how one would make similar assertions with FlexUnit 4: (You can find more information regarding FlexUnit and property (object) matchers here:  I think this approach is better in many ways compared with those described above. Of course due to limitations of Java same example would be more verbose. Still I think that implementing these matchers for JUnit is worth a shot. And if Java 7 is released we could be able to use new features (like language level support for collections) to simplify the syntax (not sure if this is a correct term). Finally, I think implementing these matchers in Java is not very complicated. Having said that, I would be glad to do it myself. I think I have got enough knowledge and experience to be able to accoplish the task. To sum up with, I believe property matchers would be great addition to JUnit testing framework. I'm looking forward to hearing Your opinion about this proposal. Mykolas Mickus (Kaunas University of Technology graduate)</body>

    <header>Snapshot release junit4.9-SNAPSHOT-20100512-0041, aka SuiteBuilder, aka "Categories the right way"</header>
    <body>All, So Categories seemed to get some people excited ( couldn't help feeling that we'd gone about it the wrong way.  From the design perspective, why have a whole Runner just for filtering by category?  There are other things you can filter on.  And, there were some definitely hackish parts of the implementation.  And, it turns out, there were bugs in Categories, (such as  to elegantly fix with the current design.  And, (sorry, maven hopefuls), but we were anxious to get back into the meat of the code. So, the first 4.9 snapshot is up today, with a new way of specifying suites, called SuiteBuilder.  SuiteBuilder allows for flexible specification of where to find the classes containing tests, and how to filter the resulting runners. This suite class lists the explicit test classes to consider running, and then filters it down to only those tests or classes annotated with `@Category(Yes.class)`: @RunWith(SuiteBuilder.class) @Classes @RunnerFilter We hope to soon include other implementations for the @Classes annotation, including a classpath-searching test gatherer.  Other implementations for @RunnerFilter also make sense (if you look close, you'll see that RunnerFilter implementations can also re-order runners, as well as selecting them). Please have fun, and let us know how it works for you.  Thanks,</body>

    <header>Maven Surefire and newer junit features</header>
    <body>Most of you are probably not aware of this, so I thought I'd just let you know: maven-surefire plugin has 2 different junit-4 providers, and the most modern one is normally only used to run parallel tests. This provider uses JUnitCore to run the tests and should (probably) support most of the "modern" junit features. The "thing" is that the JunitCore provider can be activated even for non-parallel tests by adding the following to your configuration: This will force the use of the new provider in serial mode, which is fine if you just want to get access to more modern junit features. Please note that right now you need to use 2.6-SNAPSHOT of surefire to get the latest version of the JunitCore provider.  Which is really the reason I'm writing this: I'm about to release a bug-fix release of surefire (which will probably be called 2.5.1). I do not personally have time to test all the "new" junit features with the new provider, but if anyone here has time/interest in this I can get it included in the official surefire documentation.</body>

    <body>great new direction. kind of thing, but maybe that will grow on me (a more traditional Builder pattern strikes me as less surprising), but that is nitpicking. We talked a lot about this.  Configuration from objects grabbed from annotated fields or methods has already been done incidentally at several points throughout the codebase (i.e. @Parameters, @DataPoints, @Rule).  We realized that this new runner would represent a commitment to the idea that this was a worthwhile design pattern, but found it less surprising _within the context of junit_ than the alternatives. If you have a sketch of a different design, I'd be happy to discuss it. substantial flexibility and power while keeping things simple. Thanks!</body>

    <body>I do realize that this is not a new concept in JUnit. I think my first reaction just stems from the Builder word. I hear Builder, I expect a fluid interface. That doesn't really mean very much (as I said this was nitpicking) except that if others have that reaction, well then it is surprising, for whatever importance that carries. BTW, I didn't really love it with @Rule either (although I think for @Parameters and @DataPoints it's more justified), but it didn't go against the grain of my expectations the same way Builder did. In terms of an alternative design, here is what comes to mind (although I obviously have not spent the time thinking about this that you have): @RunWith(DynamicRunner.class) Of course you could imagine the RunnerBuilder folding in all the other three annotations by using a DynamicRunner whenever you needed them, but I'm less sure about that. great new direction. kind of thing, but maybe that will grow on me (a more traditional Builder pattern strikes me as less surprising), but that is nitpicking. substantial flexibility and power while keeping things simple.</body>

    <header>RE: Real World JUnit (first time poster)</header>
    <body>The best place to start is that you and your team need to make the following commitments: *         You will stick with it for at least 30 days (you should start seeing benefits by then) *         Make room with your estimates and schedule to write the unit tests *         Everyone has the responsibility to keep the tests passing-your build needs to fail if the tests fail *         Try to make quick running tests Without the above commitments, TDD gets tossed out.  In the very beginning it may seem like a lot of extra work for very little benefit, but stick with it anyway.  It takes time to see how TDD is affecting how you approach writing code and the time saved by not having to step through the code with a debugger as often.  If you don't make room in your schedule to write the unit tests, your schedule will be off, everyone will feel behind the 8-ball, and what they are not familiar with won't get done.  Sometimes everything passes until you check in your code.  When everyone makes their (at least daily) check-ins, it helps to do a check-out and rerun the tests-just in case.  Lastly, if the tests take a long time to run, it becomes painful to run them.  If it's painful to run them, they don't get run and you lose all your benefits. As to a real world example, I've got a few.  When I first started doing TDD, it was with an open source framework I was building.  I started out dutifully writing the test, watching it fail, and doing the simplest thing that could possibly work.  Essentially I used "triangulation" to get to a set of tests that forced the code to work the way I wanted it. It seemed counterintuitive at first, even a bit awkward.  But I was willing to keep at it.  I noticed that the code I was writing was a bit different from what I used to write.  Essentially, by thinking about how I was going to test the code before I wrote the code I was intentionally making the tests easy to write.  By extension, the code I was writing was simpler and easier to comprehend.  As I progressed with writing the framework, there were a few tests that I wrote thinking I had to write something to satisfy the case, but the code already handled that case. I left the tests there to make sure the functionality didn't regress after refactoring the code.  I noticed that I was much more confident in refactoring my code regularly, and made it a point to incorporate that into the way I work.  What was the simplest thing one day isn't so simple after you've made a series of changes.  I also noticed that I was spending a lot less time in the debugger.  In fact, the only time I needed to open it up was when someone reported a difficult to reproduce bug.  Once I discovered what was happening, I added a new test case to reproduce the problem as closely as I could to the cause.  Once I got the expected failure, I was able to make the change with more confidence. My first experience introducing TDD to a team taught me a few things. First, not everyone knows how to write good tests.  The book Pragmatic Unit Testing: in Java with JUnit is a good resource with how to approach writing unit tests.  All it's examples are JUnit 3 examples, but the principles still apply no matter what your unit testing framework is. Basically, the unit tests need to be as simple as possible.  The setup, execution, and assertions need to be clear.  Adding too much to the setup will cause the tests to be harder to understand, and make them take longer to run.  Your team really needs someone to coach in writing good unit tests.  On my team, that was me.  There will likely be someone on the team that needs to know that unit tests require an assertion-they cannot rely on manual inspection.  Unit tests are not just a way to run code, they are a way to verify the code is correct.  That doesn't mean the person is stupid, they just aren't experienced with unit tests. It's a brand new idea for them.  There will likely be someone else who tries to lump multiple separate tests into one test case.  They need to be taught how to test only one thing at a time.  Lastly, with people writing unit tests with differing levels of experience, we can run into performance problems in the unit test suite.  A common area where this problem occurs is when you test anything that requires a network connection such as database access and web services.  It requires a little more creativity to solve these problems, but it can be done.  I solved the remote service problem by stubbing it out and creating a mock implementation to generate all the test conditions without requiring network services.  The database can be more of a problem, particularly because writing cross database queries can be very hard.  Sometimes it helps to separate out the database tests into a separate suite.  As long as the remainder of the unit tests run quickly, you can reserve running the database tests for the official build and the other unit tests as part of your daily work. That's a summary of the highlights with instituting TDD on a project. As people learn how to write better tests, they also end up writing better code.  The expectations, results, and error conditions are thought out much better.  It can also bring to light when different approaches are used by different people.  By changing the unit tests, you can get everyone on the same page.  You'll find some corners that just can't be tested without resorting to extraordinary lengths. Typically, these are exceptions that the Java API forces you to catch even though there is no way in your code to make those exceptions be thrown.  Examples include catching unsupported algorithm exceptions when you are using encryption algorithms installed on everyone's machine, or using a character set that exists on every instance of Java for your streams.  For those, don't worry about testing it.  It's just not worth hacking the JVM installation to force these errors.  As long as you remain consistent with your error handling techniques and you (at the very least) log the exceptions you can be pretty confident in that code.

    <header>How do I set the testcase name dynamically with using junit4?</header>
    <body>Hi, experts We're using the junit 3.8.1 currently, and we're planning to move to junit4, but we meet a question that we want to address. Imagine we have a test, and it has four test cases: And we have a boolean type which presents whether the test is transactional or not, and we want either transactional or non-transactional needs to run under testA, testB, testC. To do that, we add a suite() method, and add the tests with different transactional configuration, so that it can run actually 6 test cases. But here comes another question, how can we distinguish the failures, because there are actually 3 test cases in the test? Luckily Junit3.8.1 can set the test case name dynamically through setName, so we can do this: So when we run the test, we will get the test case name as following: With these information, we can easily figure out which test fails. But the setName() method doesn't work in Junit4, since I don't need to extend from TestCase any longer. I know I can use the Parameterized to do the same thing, but there is no way to set the customerized test case name, so what I get is: Which doesn't make sense to figure out in which mode the test fails, and the worse is that we use the test case name to create a directory to save the failed test results, but now it's hard to do that in junit4. So is there anyway to support dynamically naming a test case? Thanks and regards! Tao</body>

    <body>I think asking candidates to do TDD in an interview is a waste of time. You have about forty-five minutes to find out how good that candidate is and if you ask her to solve a problem and to begin by writing tests the TDD way, you'll waste fifteen minutes seeing code that tests for easy cases, nulls and exceptions.  Not exactly enlightening. I prefer to focus on coding problems and possibly mentioning tests and hearing what they have to say about it.  It's also perfectly okay with me if all they talk about is "automated" tests and not TDD, I don't think that TDD is a requirement to write good tests, nor does it tell me much about how good that candidate is. -- Cédric -- Cédric</body>

    <body>It depends what you're looking for. If you want to know whether your candidate can actually do TDD (as claimed on their resume), then there's only one good way to find out.

    <body>TDD is not rocket science.  If a candidate manages to solve complex programming problems during the interview and they have never heard of TDD before, it will be easy for them to learn if you are imposing this at your company (a mistake in my opinion, but that's a separate topic). As for your remark about incremental development, all the examples I have seen of TDD when you start from scratch begin by testing trivial cases.  It will take at least a half hour before the candidate starts writing code that's actually complex, which is why I think it's a waste of time in an interview. -- Cédric</body>

    <body>I agree with Cedric that TDD isn't necessary at an interview.    If I think about the biggest benefits of writing unit tests, they are: 1) Make sure the code works (quality) 2) Make sure the code stays working (regression/maintenance) Neither of these are critical on an interview.  Clearly #2 doesn't matter.  It's an exercise that will never make it to production, let alone be maintained. #1 is more interesting.  On first glance, one would think the code needs to work at an interview.  While that's nice, I don't view that as the most important thing when I am interviewing.  I am more interested in seeing how the candidate thinks, looks up information, reacts to errors, whether he/she seems comfortable with basic Java idioms. In my opinion, more organizations should have candidates writing code on a computer as part of the interview.  This is still rarer than I would like.</body>

    <body>Mike, Three thoughts: 1) Did any of these interviews provide an actual execution environment with which to run your tests?  Without the possibility of learning new things from the execution of the tests, I can imagine changing the way I'd apply a test-driven mindset.   (I've yet to give or receive an interview that actually used a computer.) 2) For a while, I would give interviews where I'd describe a set of requirements for a system design, and then ask the candidate to write a test for a core component in the system, without implementing it first.  I found that only a few absolute superstars could make headway--interestingly, these were split about 50/50 between those who had at least tried TDD, and just incredibly intelligent  people able to get their heads around a problem no matter how it was presented. 3) On the other hand, I've noticed that applicants who end up writing buggy implementations in interviews often do so because they stop with a solution that works on a single example, and have a hard time thinking of ways it could break on other types of input.  I'd like to think that every professional developer finds ways to get continuously TDD does that for me. interviews.</body>

    <header>Re: When it matters most, don't forget your tests.</header>
    <body>Thank you to all those that responded. I agree that if a candidate spends all their time on the simple error cases then they don't understand TDD. I think a pair programming environment would be ideal for an interview. Maybe actually have the candidate solve an actual problem you're solving. This may sound like it may take a lot of time, but I'd rather be part of a team that can spend 1-2 hours writing code in an interview, then waste that time on soft silks.  If the candidate complains that it's not their IDE/editor of choice, that should send up a flag. Granted this is my ideal environment. What about a 2 stage interview? One where they write the tests for a already existing piece of code (maybe to increase the codes functionality), then another where they try and write code to get the tests to pass.

    <header>Re: Test runtime scenario using junit</header>
    <body>Hello Ananth, Just to give my 2cents on this problem, I would suggest looking at a solution that also involves some distributed cache (like ehCache or perhaps Terracotta). The general idea is to have the code on the VmWare side populated once, and then stored in this distributed cache. Then you can start your JUnit tests, and they simply start their own cache, which is configured to work distributed and connect to the already running cache of VmWare-related objects. Then the objects that you created with VmWare will also be available for the unit tests. The connection in JUnit can be performed in a Rule or in the BeforeClass methods. Cheers, Bogdan</body>

    <body>To the OP, I think you forgot TDD because you're human. Hard to cure, but perfectly understandable :-) To all, if you expect developers to use TDD in their work, it makes perfect sense to ask them to demonstrate it in an interview. There are a wide range of TDD skills (working on TDD screencasts at the moment continually reminds both how much I know and how very much I don't). If you are pressed for time, you might be able to get some good information by asking them to list the tests they would write for a given problem instead of actually coding. Regards, Kent</body>

    <header>RE: When it matters most, don't forget your tests.</header>
    <body>I've been silent on this for a while, but I did want to chime in.  If you require TDD in your project, you should resign yourself to the fact that you will have to train the prospects on what you mean by that and what level of testing you require even under deadline.  The sad truth is that many projects claim to be "agile" only so they can throw away the most fundamental engineering practices (like CM, much less testing). The later a project is, the more they will look to throw away what they really feel are unnecessary practices, or barriers to progress. Fundamental CM and project management will work with the client to adjust scope or deadline, but we won't go there for the moment. What I've found as a result of this phenomenon is that the vast majority of people I interview have no concept of unit testing, much less TDD. That doesn't mean that the people are bad resources.  It just means that unit testing hasn't saved their bacon yet, and they haven't been required to stick to it long enough for that to happen.  What that means is that I have to build time into my schedule to teach how unit testing works, and how TDD works.  I'll relax the requirement for the tests to be written first for these folks, as long as the tests get written. Part of the training progress is showing them where they are either writing too much code, or not enough tests. I tend to focus on the more critical aspects of troubleshooting skills, and determining if their claimed skills are just paper thin.  After that I check their willingness to do TDD.  My assumption is that I'm going to have to teach them.  Running these engineering tests are only necessary when you are dealing with junior positions. -----Original Message----- From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Kent Beck Sent: Monday, May 03, 2010 7:59 PM To: junit@yahoogroups.com Subject: Re: [junit] When it matters most, don't forget your tests.

And then once they have that, we ask them to tell us how they'd unit test what they just wrote. It's a rare individual that says, "Damn, now I realize I should have written the unit test FIRST!"  And out of probably 100 candidates in the past few years of this approach, not a single candidate has ever actually written a JUnit/NUnit/whatever test case first.

    <body>None of my university classes covered version control.  It wasn't until I got my first job that I even heard of the concept. Similarly (and bringing this a little more back on topic) none of my university classes covered unit testing, either.  But that was long before TDD and the whole "test infected" thing. As far as I know, none of my university professors (both undergrad and graduate) had any clue about version control or unit testing, especially automated unit testing.  I just always chalked that up to them having a completely academic background, with no real world professional software engineering experience.  An important part of the first 5 years of my career was understanding the difference between how professors wanted things done and how things are done in the industry.  Nobody told me in college that they would be such different worlds.

Groups of 8 people worked together to add features to an application. The application could only be submitted through CVS. The application had to have tests that passed and teams that didn't do them or had them broken were penalised. The application had to have a documentation of the new functionality in terms of use cases which mapped into tests, at the time we used a tool called objecteering (I thinkl). And teams that didn't do it were penalised. At that time neither me nor most of my colleagues understood the value of all this, but now I'm happy that I had that first experience. Nuno</body>

    <header>String concatenation is costly - WAS: Disabling test code generation globally?</header>
    <body>Hi, yes, String concatenation is known to be a serious performance lack. And it also blows up the size of the compiled code without use. At least for code to be transmitted over the Internet (e.g. by Java Web Start or in Applets) this should be avoided too. Java does conditional compilation if the condition is final. Without conditional compilation there is no other way than commenting out the hundreds of assertions manually - not really realistic. This keeps me from using standard test frameworks in my own projects. In my own logger I have such a global boolean flag to disable test code generation. But this also can not stop those message String concatenations because these are done before passing the resulting String to the internally disabled assertTrue(message, ok) method. Would it be technically impossible to solve this through an annotation like e.g. @EnableTestCodeGeneration? Annotations are recognized at compile time. tomte</body>

    <header>Re: Class-level @Rule</header>
    <body>Max, I really don't think that is true. MethodRule allows you to do things based on the specific test name, and intercept and even replace the running of a test. Consider ExpectedException. You really could not do anything like that in a @Before or @After method. You would have to do it inside your test and use an execute around pattern to handle the exception. For your use case it is a drop more boilerplate than a rule, but all you would do is define a @Before method in a common superclass or in your @Before call a class that encapsulates the functionality. Yes you have to wrap the call in a method rather than defining a field, but Java is kind of verbose already. method? should be MethodRule, but that would require all the rules out there to change. reduces the chances that tests are independent.

    <body>Your point concerning ExpectedException is valid, but arguing that method rules are even more useful than class rules does not say anything about class rules being unuseful. "Java is verbose already" is not a good reason to make things even more unnecessarily verbose. You say I should write: I want to write: Personally, I think the second is self-evidently greatly advantageous. * Much less boilerplate in each test using the common code. * Don't need to repeat yourself nearly as much. * No risk of forgetting the teardown.

    <header>Re: String concatenation is costly - WAS: Disabling test code generation globally?</header>
    <body>Hi tomte, indeed, if you have a multitude of such operations, the difference in the generated compiled code can be of some importance. However, since we are talking here about unit tests, these are parts of your project that are not packaged and deployed with your binaries. Unit tests are executed, and if passed ok they are then ignored, when the final package is created. Therefore, I think the concern for this difference in the compiled code is not justified. Moreover, I don't think it is possible to make the compiler ommit parts of the code based on annotations. At most you can benefit of the smart features of the compiler that, as you said, eliminates the parts of the code that cannot be reached because of some final condition. So you could technically define a multitude of final constants, like some switches, that can enable/disable parts of the unit tests. But I repeat: I think the effort is not justified. We are talking here about unit tests, which are not deployed on client's system.

Do you mean you prefer performance over correctness? That sends up a bunch of red flags: - your own logger -- nothing else is good enough, you have to write your own? - disable test code -- do you mix test code and production code? - you're worried about test performance but didn't profile?

    <header>Re: Class-level @Rule</header>
    <body>Thankyou, this I can usefully do. Alistair Israel's patch is a straightforward propagation of the existing concepts of MethodRules to class level. Daniel Brolund's patch picks the terminology of "TestCaseRule" for this feature, which I find less appropriate than "ClassRule" given that tests can be ordinary classes now rather than inheriting from junit.framework.TestCase. It also goes considerably further, extending the concept of rules beyond classes, to suites, and adding the concept of propagating rules from suites to individual classes and methods. In the parts where the two overlap, I believe Alistair Israel's to be slightly superior in the minor details: * Passes an org.junit.runners.model.TestClass to its class-level * Validates that ClassRule fields must be static. In other respects, it seems to me that Daniel Brolund's work is close to being a superset of Alistair Israel's. Therefore, I propose that what should happen is: * Review/merge Alistair Israel's work, and declare issue 29 fixed. * Invite Daniel Brolund to tweak his extended work to be based upon Thanks, Max.</body>

    <header>Re: Class-level @Rule</header>
    <body>Hi Max, I guess my question is other than the syntactical sugar, what does a class level rule gain for you? I would expect it to be something more than a way of avoiding that kind of boilerplate. As an example of the kind of thing I think a class rule would enable, is that it might allow the rule to dynamically pass values to the test class's constructor based on some dynamic criteria (say a souped up version of Parameterized) or perhaps change the runner that will run the tests, or dynamically disable certain tests (say based on the OS the test is running on). Something that is not possible with an @BeforeClass or @AfterClass annotation. But that is just my imagination. I'm curious if there are real use cases like that.</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Re: Class-level @Rule</header>
    <body>I just explained that in my previous reply. When the boilerplate that is avoided is so excessive, the syntactic sugar itself becomes a valuable feature. No. Test class instantiation occurs per-method, not per-class, thus class-level is not where it can be changed. No. The Runner is what invokes the rules, so rules can't change the runner. A class rule could skip an entire class of tests, if you wanted it to. The ability to package a common class-level setup/teardown behaviour and re-use it in many places is what rules provide over embedded before/after methods. That's very useful by itself, and they don't have to do anything more to justify their existence. Max.</body>

    <header>About @DataPoint and @ Theory</header>
    <body>Hi, the usage of @DataPoint and @Theory. and i hope my test framework can handle each compatible @DataPoint for the @Theory test as the independent test to run. I hope everyone of this kind test can generate their own "Assertion Success" or "Assertion Fail". For example: @DataPoint @DataPoint @DataPoint @Theory assertEquals("Two strings are not matched!", "Test in our test framework. But it fails. matter how many compatible @DataPoint parameters there are. And it will fail the test once an Assertion Fail generate, then, stop here and ignore the left @DataPoint parameters. result, we don't want the test to stop by only one fail result, we want to see all results by one time run. requirement, I think it will provide more convenience for every tester.

    <header>Re: Class-level @Rule</header>
    <body>I really don't perceive that as excessive boilerplate. YMMV. Test instantiation is yes, but I would expect a ClassRule to provide a hook into the instance generation process (although for the whole class, not each case at a time). Just like the ExpectedException rule intercepts the Statement and replaces it with its own, a ClassRule can intercept the Runner and replace it with its own (possibly). Hmm, I guess we have to agree to disagree on that one.</body>

    <header>Test runtime scenario using junit</header>
    <body>Hi, Is it possible to test a runtime scenario using junit? For instance, similar to attaching an eclipse debugger to a running process, attach a junit test suite to an already running JVM? The reason why I have this doubt is because, I am making changes to a small part of a huge code base, but in order to test the small code change a lot of other objects have to be populated before invoking the test method. Also, attaching to a running process similar to eclipse debugger, would help me simulate run time scenarios and check if expected exceptions are thrown by the method being tested by Junit. Please get back to me if my question is not clear. Thank you Regards Ananth</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Test runtime scenario using junit</header>
    <body>Ananth, Needing to change a small area in a large, tangled codebase is an all-too-familiar problem.  If you haven't already read Michael Feather's Working Effectively With Legacy Code, you'll likely get a lot out of it.  The short version is: for every hour that you spend writing tests that have to work around these large dependencies, if you can find at least another hour to improve the design of the tested code to reduce those dependencies, the second hour will very often pay itself off fairly quickly. That said, can you help me understand the scenario you have in mind? Especially, are the objects that need to be populated somehow globally accessible, or do you need to somehow pass them into the JUnit test? Thanks, to attaching an eclipse debugger to a running process, attach a junit test suite to an already running JVM? part of a huge code base, but in order to test the small code change a lot of other objects have to be populated before invoking the test method. Also, attaching to a running process similar to eclipse debugger, would help me simulate run time scenarios and check if expected exceptions are thrown by the method being tested by Junit.</body>

    <header>Best way to do "assertNotEquals()"?</header>
    <body>I must be missing something simple, but why is there no "assertNotEquals()" in JUnit?  There is "assertNotSame()", but that's not quite the same thing.  I guess "assertFalse(expected.equals(actual))" is about the best I can do.</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: Best way to do "assertNotEquals()"?</header>
    <body>The challenge with assertions is figuring out which ones need to be in org.junit.Assert and which can reasonably be left out. There are potentially thousands of possible assertions that make sense in various domains, but we can't include them all. If we only provide fail(), that's not enough. AssertNotEquals() fell below the line. Matchers provide a nice clean way to add variations to assertions without cluttering the core of JUnit. I hope people take more advantage of customer matchers in the future. Regards, Kent</body>

    <header>Re: Test runtime scenario using junit</header>
    <body>Hi David, Thanks for the reply. To answer your question, I need to somehow pass the objects into the Junit test to call the method. Let me explain the scenario better. My problem is not that i am unable to test the small code change. I would be able to write testmethods only to exercise that part of the code. But in order to simulate a run time scenario, i need hav a lot of objects populated already. The kind of environment i need to simulate before calling the test method, is something like this. I need to have a VmwareESX host to be registered in my application database, and identify what are the VMs installed on that machine and and trigger an operation on those VMs to move from one host to another. This kind of scenario is very difficult to populate on objects. I was looking at a way to do those operations manually on my running application, and attach the Junit test class to the already running process where i will already have the environment. I can use my application to do those set up operations before i trigger the junit test case. This is very similar to how we can attach an eclipse debugger to a running windows service and point to a source code to debug. The parameters eclipse would take for that (remote debugging) are ip address and port number. Is there anything similar available with Junit framework? Hope i have not confused you even more :) Regards Ananth -- Regards Ananth</body>

    <body>This may be better in a blog post, which I will hopefully get to... but I'd like to pose two questions to the group first.  Let's call it research. I've just completed a set of interviews and looking back on the coding questions.  I realized that I never followed my test first mantra that I perform at home. First question, to those giving the interview... Would you ever suggest/remind a candidate of TDD style in his/her code? Second question, why on earth does a candidate, like myself, forget to write tests and incrementally improve their code?  Do this show a lack of software development maturity? As a community reminder, and to myself.... don't forget TDD style on interviews.</body>

  <mail>
    <header>Re: When it matters most, don't forget your tests.</header>
    <body>Hi Mike, I think it's interesting that under the "heat" of an interview, TDD practices get dumped. The same seems to happen to many developers under the heat of a challenging deadline. When I interviewed candidates in the past, I pay close attention to if they mention TDD or automated unit testing. If they don't mention it themselves, I ask. That is because I believe it is one of most important (perhaps THE most important) development skills. I also ask a lot of questions regarding test case identification. It has been a long time since I was on an interview which asked me to write code. However, the last interview I was on, I was presented with a code sample and asked what was wrong with it. It was a single function, spanning three printed pages, with a "bug" somewhere in it. I told the interviewer that the problem was there were no unit tests, and the code was not clearly written - after fixing those two things, the bug should be obvious. It's easy to forget these things during an interview. Developer interviews that I have seen tend to focus on specific developer experiences, such as familiarity with specific languages or technologies, or knowledge of a certain domain. It is easy for the interviewer and candidate to get lost in these details and forget good practices. I think this focus is generally a mistake. I think the focus should be on demonstrating experience with good development practices, good design, testing, well-written code, along with a desire to learn and grow as a developer on a team.

    <header>Re: Chain tests, and share information accross several tests</header>
    <body>Hi Yves, For JUnit it is an anti-pattern to do so. JUnit doesn't guarantee any order of test execution. So JUnit is free to execute your tests in reverse order, if it so chooses. JUnit is optimized for small unit level tests and wants the tests to be decoupled, so they can be executed in part or in any order. So you use JUnit in an uncommon way for an uncommon task, at least as JUnit is concerned. BTW: JUnit stops execution of a test-method on the first error. It then continues with the next test in the suite. You might want to take a look at TestNG. There you can do more in terms of ordering tests. And besides, you might need to think about what is a test for you and how do you program that with JUnit or alike. It might be better to actually build one test method in JUnit that also corresponds to one of your tests, so you align the continue/stop behaviour of junit with what suites your needs.

    <header>Re: Chain tests, and share information accross several tests</header>
    <body>Yves, Tests are intended to be isolated and self-sufficient in JUnit. This enables the tests to become more valuable by executing in parallel, sorting by likelihood of failure, and creating false negative results less often just because someone changed the order of declaration in a file. So the short answer is that no, JUnit doesn't support the kind of ordering you are talking about. I'm sure you could make it work, but you'd be going against the grain of the design. In my experience the best way to express sequence is with adjacent lines of code: Underneath I could implement these with Command objects or whatever was most appropriate.

Something like: [test step 1] --&amp;gt; [test step 2] --&amp;gt; [test step 3] and so on... AND we will be able to test several workflow branches in parallel, that's interesting.

I am looking for an switch / option / assertion? to switch off test code generation globally, for instance the String concatenations shown above should be suppressed. For assertTrue( "...", ok) no code should be compiled at all. Also calls to data intensive tests, maybe residing in special test classes and having costly setups, should be suppressed. Any ideas?

    <header>RE: Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories</header>
    <body>My initial post had to do with performance due to the complexity of collecting the datapoints multiple times.  The solution I suggested was to have the class collect the datapoints once, and then copy the datapoints as needed. So it looks as if the patch may solve that part of the issue.  I'll have to look into the strategies as they are listed.  I hope we are not introducing an interface or base class that would be required for the data classes to implement.  That would cause problems with using Theories to test interface contracts. ________________________________ From: junit@yahoogroups.com on behalf of Brett Daniel Sent: Fri 3/12/2010 6:44 PM To: junit@yahoogroups.com Cc: Shin Hwei Tan; Sang Y Baik Subject: Re: [junit] Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories The undergrads I am advising recently pushed a patch that addresses the issue of mutable data points.  The patch allows developers to define "copy strategies" that duplicate marked data points before every theory execution. In this way, every execution receives a pristine data point, which removes the problems caused when a theory mutates data points. This is orthogonal to datapoint (re)creation, but I think copy strategies may help address the bug that Berin found. The patch creates a new, optional "copyStrategy" parameter for the @DataPoint and @DataPoints annotations. If the developer wants to copy data points, he or she sets the parameter to a class implementing a new CopyStrategy interface. Here is an example: @RunWith(Theories.class) @DataPoint(copyStrategy = MutableWithCopyStrategy.class) @Theory @Theory In the current implementation of JUnit, the second theory may fail because the first theory mutates the datapoint. With a copy strategy enabled, both theories receive a new value. Strategies can do almost anything: clone the data point, call a factory method, or--as in the following implementation--instantaiate a new object with a copy constructor. There are several benefits to this implementation. First, the new parameter is completely optional; if it is omitted, the theory runner behaves as it always has. Second, it doesn't require modifying the data point's class (for example, to add a copy constructor or clone method). Most importantly, it makes it clear to the tester that without a copy strategy one theory execution can impact another. I have CC'd the two students in this email.

However, I see two drawbacks in addition to those you mention.  First, one would need to include the copy invocation in every @DataPoint method that used createdOnce. In contrast, annotating the @DataPoint itself would provide all consumers with pristine values.  Second, the solution fails when using @DataPoints with a theory that takes multiple parameters: The code above fails because a and b can be aliases for the same object. It may of course be desirable to run a theory on identical instances, but in that case, the user could make that behavior explicit in another theory. David wrote... ... Do I understand correctly that you are suggesting pulling the PotentialAssignment array out of the internal Theory runner and making it available to developers? I seem to remember that Sang and Shin Hwei experimented with modifications to the PotentialAssignment and ParameterSupplier classes, but they can describe what they did better than I. David wrote... ... I like the idea of allowing data sources that produce things on-demand rather than in a pre-constructed array of values. This gets back to a brief discussion you and I had a long time ago about having the @DataPoints annotation return Iterable&amp;lt;DataPointType&amp;gt;. That would make things like the following possible: I don't know if it is better to overload @DataPoints or define new @DataPointSupplier/@DataPointSource annotations. Berin wrote... Absolutely not. That is one of the benefits of defining copy strategies in the @DataPoint annotations: the data point classes themselves remain unchaged. Berin wrote... Sang and Shin Hwei implemented several copy strategies, including one that uses clone, but they did not include them in the patch in an effort to reduce its size and complexity.

    <header>RE: Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories</header>
    <body>would be much better than arrays for @Datapoints.  That would avoid the toArray(new Mutable[collection.size()]) I would have to create and reduce the number of objects in the garbage collector.  I guess that would put me on your side with that particular approach.  BTW, arrays are iterable...  I do create data dynamically for testing theories, particularly if I am testing interface contracts. Regarding extracting the parameters interface, I'm not suggesting making that an API available outside the core.  I'm suggesting a little DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) to have a class that is responsible for collecting the raw data points (calling the @DataPoint and @DataPoints once), and copying them as necessary to satisfy the parameter sets on the individual tests.  That same approach can theorhetically feed parameterized tests.  The long and short of it is that I am suggesting the change for code maintenance reasons.  That would also make my feature enhancement to track each parameter set as a separate test (@Theory(runDiscretely=true)) a bit easier to implement. I think it would be reasonable to include the CloneableStrategy along with the solution.  That way, you have custom copy strategies, a cloning copy strategy, and I guess the default would be an identity strategy (i.e. not copying at all). With your code example and the current implementation, if the datapoints are defined in the @DataPoints method then you have a fresh instance of each data point--even when the values are identical.  That's due to the bug that I mentioned.  The @DataPoints is called the first time, and for each data point, it is called again to make the combinations.  Using an identity copy strategy (i.e. not copying) will introduce problems with mutable data types. ________________________________ From: junit@yahoogroups.com on behalf of Brett Daniel Sent: Mon 3/15/2010 1:56 PM To: junit@yahoogroups.com Subject: Re: [junit] Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories David, Berin, and Mike, Thank you very much for the great comments.

    <header>RE: Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories</header>
    <body>David, Berin, Mike and Brett, Thanks for all the helpful comments. Regarding the default CloneStrategy, Sang and I started with the following strategies: 1. Strategy for Collection Class 2. Using the clone() method for DataPoint(s) that implements Cloneable 3. Using Interfaces of DataPoint(s) 4. Using the copy constructor of the DataPoint(s) class 5. Using the copy constructor of the super class of the DataPoint. Below is the method that contains the CloneableStrategy: When we implemented the above default strategies, we had a hard time in deciding which strategy should be used first. I think the same problem will occur if both copy constructor and cloning are available. In that case, I think the user should be able to chose the desired strategy. Berin mentioned the performance issue within the method getCopyStrategyInvokedObject. I agree that creating a new instance for every object will have a significant impact on performance. I will discuss it with Sang and try to fix the problem. To: junit@yahoogroups.com; junit@yahoogroups.com From: berin.loritsch@...

That same approach can theorhetically feed parameterized tests.  The long and short of it is that I am suggesting the change for code maintenance reasons.  That would also make my feature enhancement to track each parameter set as a separate test (@Theory(runDiscretely=true)) a bit easier to implement. I think it would be reasonable to include the CloneableStrategy along with the solution.  That way, you have custom copy strategies, a cloning copy strategy, and I guess the default would be an identity strategy (i.e. not copying at all). With your code example and the current implementation, if the datapoints are defined in the @DataPoints method then you have a fresh instance of each data point--even when the values are identical.  That's due to the bug that I mentioned.  The @DataPoints is called the first time, and for each data point, it is called again to make the combinations.  Using an identity copy strategy (i.e. not copying) will introduce problems with mutable data types. ________________________________ From: junit@yahoogroups.com on behalf of Brett Daniel Sent: Mon 3/15/2010 1:56 PM To: junit@yahoogroups.com Subject: Re: [junit] Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories David, Berin, and Mike, Thank you very much for the great comments. I have asked Shin Hwei and Sang to provide their thoughts, but until then, here are my answers to your specific questions (SH&amp;amp;S will correct me if I get anything wrong). David wrote... intractable You are correct that copying within a @Datapoint method would create a new data point as needed and would probably be a good workaround for Berin's bug. However, I see two drawbacks in addition to those you mention. First, one would need to include the copy invocation in every @DataPoint method that used createdOnce. In contrast, annotating the @DataPoint itself would provide all consumers with pristine values. Second, the solution fails when using @DataPoints with a theory that takes multiple parameters: new Mutable(), @DataPoints() new Mutable(createdOnce[0]), new Mutable(createdOnce[1]) @Theory The code above fails because a and b can be aliases for the same object. It may of course be desirable to run a theory on identical instances, but in that case, the user could make that behavior explicit in another theory. David wrote... ... Do I understand correctly that you are suggesting pulling the PotentialAssignment array out of the internal Theory runner and making it available to developers? I seem to remember that Sang and Shin Hwei experimented with modifications to the PotentialAssignment and ParameterSupplier classes, but they can describe what they did better than I.

    <header>RE: JUnitBenchmarks (application of @Rule)</header>
    <body>Iâm not going to argue at all about the benchmark comments.  Essentially we are in agreement.  Since most of my tests (currently only self tests) are less than a ms, very minor differences in timing can affect the speed of the tests to a very large degree.  For example, running my own tests within the Maven infrastructure has provided a variance between 2ms and 9ms to run the entire suite of tests.  That variance depends on whether the garbage collector is running during testing or not. The goal of the library isnât so much to work miracles as it is to make it easier to do this type of testing. For QoS testing, letâs say you have a suite of tests that simply verify correctness.  For a simple system, that can be enough.  However, you may discover race conditions and deadlocks in parallel code in a production environment.  The idea is to run all those correctness tests over and over until the system passes with a high enough degree of certainty or you introduce a failure.  In addition to ensuring correctness under load, the test framework will allow you to ensure that all the responses are within a certain timeout threshold. At least that is the end goal.  Another short win would be when there are a mix of short and long running tests.  Unless you have a suite of many long running tests, running the tests in parallel will allow you to shorten the clock time of testing.  Shorter clock times mean quicker turn around for testing.  That in turn encourages the tests to be run more frequently. Thereâs a lot to be worked out as of yet.  My âHoly Grailâ, so to speak, is to have the executing tests behave as if it were running single threaded from the perspective of the test writer.  That is my real end goal.  QoS testing would be a nice and easy win along with the project.

    <header>Re: Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories</header>
    <body>The undergrads I am advising recently pushed a patch that addresses the issue of mutable data points.  The patch allows developers to define "copy strategies" that duplicate marked data points before every theory execution. In this way, every execution receives a pristine data point, which removes the problems caused when a theory mutates data points. This is orthogonal to datapoint (re)creation, but I think copy strategies may help address the bug that Berin found. The patch creates a new, optional "copyStrategy" parameter for the @DataPoint and @DataPoints annotations. If the developer wants to copy data points, he or she sets the parameter to a class implementing a new CopyStrategy interface. Here is an example: In the current implementation of JUnit, the second theory may fail because the first theory mutates the datapoint. With a copy strategy enabled, both theories receive a new value. Strategies can do almost anything: clone the data point, call a factory method, or--as in the following implementation--instantaiate a new object with a copy constructor. There are several benefits to this implementation. First, the new parameter is completely optional; if it is omitted, the theory runner behaves as it always has. Second, it doesn't require modifying the data point's class (for example, to add a copy constructor or clone method). Most importantly, it makes it clear to the tester that without a copy strategy one theory execution can impact another. I have CC'd the two students in this email. Please direct any questions to them. Brett</body>

Just to be clear, do you agree the below would work with the current implementation of Theories?  It's four lines more of boilerplate, but not totally intractable, in my humble opinion: @RunWith(Theories.class) I think though, that requiring both the field and the method to be there in the class could restrict the ability to share data and concepts.  What would you think of allowing fields or methods to return PontentialAssignment, the type of named references to data values used in the Theories runner?  Then we could have: @RunWith(Theories.class) Here, I'm guessing about the typing on PotentialAssignment and the name of the DataPointSource annotation, but perhaps the idea is clear?</body>

    <header>Re: Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories</header>
    <body>After further thought, the ParameterSupplier class is even better for this kind of thing: Thus: @RunWith(Theories.class) This would allow a supplier to supply zero, one, or many inputs to a parameter signature.  Here's a supplier for all ints from -10 to 10: @DataSupplier public static OneTypeSupplier&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; ints = Here's one that supplies null for any type that can take them: @DataSupplier public static ParameterSupplier nullsEverywhere = And something crazy and experimental that will keep pumping out values until half a second has passed: @DataSupplier public static ParameterSupplier timeLimited = (This one would require the return type from ParameterSupplier#getValueSources to be Iterable, which I think would be a good idea anyway) And one that combines many other suppliers, for easy sharing 'twixt test classes: @DataSupplier public static ParameterSupplier combined = new Thus, in another class: This begins to approach the "Rule" threshhold for triggering a lot of very plausible ideas with only small changes to interface and implementation.

    <header>[RT] JUnit Core, Parallelism, Documentation</header>
    <body>RT = Random Thought.  It's a habit I picked up from Stefano Mazzocchi when I used to work with him on the Cocoon project.  Essentially, it's a structured brain dump based on observations of the internals of a project (as such it is longer than most posts).  My apologies if this is not the forum for this. == Code Maintenance Thoughts == I've been going through some of the JUnit Core to add some JavaDocs (it's in my forked copy if you want me to do a Push request), and made a few observations.  I can definitely see how JUnit has begun to evolve over the years, and as is natural with a couple missteps along the way. It's hard to get rid of those missteps because some people may have extended them.  Some of the classes have been deprecated with the promise that they would be removed in the next revision (as of 4.4) and they are still there.  I'm not saying that the current solution is a misstep, just that it is hard to separate the past ones from the current preferred solution. Part of managing a codebase like this includes separating the public and private API.  Some of that has been done with the "internal" package. There is no reason to worry about deprecating classes and methods in the internal package because they are not part of the public API.  But I did notice that when some classes got moved, the old class in full was kept in the original location.  A low maintenance way of performing a move like that makes use of inheritance.  Essentially the newer class is moved so there is one maintenance location, and the deprecated class extends the newer class.  Kind of like how the JUnit4 runner provides a preferred alias to the BlockJUnit4Runner class. Part of the core includes a nice little callback interface (the RunListener).  I imagine that a number of integrations make good use of this little class.  However, with the implementation as it is currently written, the RunListener can affect the run performance and parallelism available.  Essentially, the act of calling a method is a synchronous function.  That means a poorly written runner can detrimentally affect the performance of JUnit.  The one that is included with JUnit is pretty tame, doing the absolute minimum it has to do to track the test progress.  However, if your tests execute slower in an IDE than with JUnit alone, it's probably the RunListener slowing things down. == Parallelism Thoughts == Some of the architectural decisions in JUnit's core definitely reflect the synchronous nature that the tests were designed to be written.  I don't think there is going to be an easy solution to that problem, unless you stick to a test class per thread model.  More on that a bit latter. When designing for parallel execution of tests (the ParallelComputer hints at this), you usually don't want an unbounded number of threads to be executed in the system.  A fairly common approach to taming the thread/work apportioning beast is to use queues and worker threads. Essentially, each test (including the set up and tear down parts) gets pushed on to the queue, while the executor pops it off on the other side in another process.  Essentially the relationship to executors to work queues depends on whatever rules you've set up.  For JUnit a simple mapping of executors to the number of processors (cores) or some multiple of that would be sufficient.  This model is closer to how JMS works without all the quality of service overhead.  As the executor runs the test, it sends notification objects to the notification queue. Using one line of ASCII art, the process looks like this: Classes/Suite ==&amp;gt; Executor ==&amp;gt; Notifier Each "==&amp;gt;" represents a queue.  The notification mechanism then becomes more like Swing events.  We could even cheat and use an Java 5 enum for the types of events.  This provides the same interface for all the events, and the convenience of an enum for determining the type of event.  If we take this approach a step further, if we substitute a PriorityQueue for the first queue, we get a way to prefer some tests over others (e.g. using categories as a priority mechanism).  Collecting the results in a separate thread than they are being executed protects the execution of tests from poorly written listeners. We could go to a very fine level of detail (i.e. each individual test) if it weren't for the class setup/tear down methods.  Those kind of tests would force some sort of ordering.  It's not entirely impossible, but does require more care. Such an approach may be over-engineering things a bit, and for short runs of a couple hundred tests that takes less than a second to run definitely overkill.  However for larger projects with much larger execution times, it may be a way to short circuit the execution a bit. Essentially the win here would be the ability to execute tests while they are still being parsed and prepared.  That can help with things like Theories where collecting a large number of DataPoints can have a profound impact on the time it takes to run. It would be pretty easy to ensure that no more than n+2 threads are used in a system, where n = Runtime.availableProcessors().</body>

    <header>Re: [RT] JUnit Core, Parallelism, Documentation</header>
    <body>Hi Berin, interesting ideas. A small warning at the beginning: I don't know enough about JUnits inner workings, really. Changing JUnit to execute tests in parallel is an interesting, but somewhat dangerous idea. Sequential is easier to reason about and easier to get right. I sure don't want to get my tests wrong! It's easy enough to get my programms wrong... I don't think we can change the default to multi-threaded. This would lead to all kind of trouble. Since tests that can be executed in parallel need to be programmed that way. So it would have to be an option. This requires some thinking, how the two approaches might be mixed. I agree that class level paralellization is probaby a good start. Though I don't see a real problem with @Before and @After with regard to parallel execution, only with @BeforeClass and @AfterClass setup. The real problem has more to do with the user supplied code. If I think about my test suite now, that uses Spring, I don't know for sure what would happen, would I execute all the tests in parallel. I suspect all kinds of oddeties would occour... Greetings,</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>RE: [RT] JUnit Core, Parallelism, Documentation</header>
    <body>Right.  I wouldn't necessarily suggest making parallel execution the default, and your observation is the same as mine. Spring code is threadsafe, or at least designed to work in a heavily threaded environment like serving up web pages.  There are ways of enforcing a perceived order, even if the actual order is different. That's basically how Tomcat and Apache operate with the non-blocking IO.

A small warning at the beginning: I don't know enough about JUnits inner workings, really. Changing JUnit to execute tests in parallel is an interesting, but somewhat dangerous idea. Sequential is easier to reason about and easier to get right. I sure don't want to get my tests wrong! It's easy enough to get my programms wrong... I don't think we can change the default to multi-threaded. This would lead to all kind of trouble. Since tests that can be executed in parallel need to be programmed that way. So it would have to be an option. This requires some thinking, how the two approaches might be mixed. I agree that class level paralellization is probaby a good start. Though I don't see a real problem with @Before and @After with regard to parallel execution, only with @BeforeClass and @AfterClass setup. The real problem has more to do with the user supplied code. If I think about my test suite now, that uses Spring, I don't know for sure what would happen, would I execute all the tests in parallel. I suspect all kinds of oddeties would occour...

    <body>That's not what I meant. I know that Spring itself is thread safe, but since Spring uses mostly singletons, my spring beans have to be thread safe. And if I execute n tests in parallel in any random order and they all execute on the same object (singleton spring bean), this might result in problems. Maybe that's just part of a good test, because my beans need to be thread safe anyhow. But maybe not. Greetings,</body>

    <header>Spring in JUnit (was RE: [RT] JUnit Core, Parallelism, Documentation)</header>
    <body>That brings up a good point about Spring.  I personally would prefer not to set up a Spring environment in my code for the purpose of testing, but Spring has so many goodies that add to the desired function of what you are writing you can't do otherwise. For example, the Spring/Hibernate integration is a pretty common solution for most folks.  The problem is that ThreadSafe bound transaction manager.  Maybe I just need to know how to configure the transaction manager to always roll back the transaction at the end of a test, but essentially this combination forces you down the road of performing integration tests when all you want to do is perform unit tests.  There's a really good video out there on why "Integration Tests are a Scam", which describes in pretty simple terms the problem of this approach. I really am not a fan of frameworks that don't let you do perform simple unit testing.  At the same time these frameworks are very useful and help solve problems more quickly.

With regard to deprecation, we've definitely begun to feel the weight of the old code, but have indeed felt that it's not clear whether being very aggressive would be in the best interests of users: thanks to the fact that many users of tools like Eclipse and Maven have their JUnit version automatically updated without explicit intervention, it's easy to be the cause of breaking something that's been working for years.

I've mentioned to Kent that we should do a codesearch.google.com smackdown, and start kicking the least-used public method or class "off the island" with each release. As you mention, I think that the biggest obstacle to real parallelism is an replacement or enhancement of the BeforeClass/AfterClass idiom that is well-defined outside of a single-threaded execution.  As two examples, (1) it's not well-defined whether a BeforeClass method should be able to be run more than once per test suite execution, (2) it's not well-defined whether one class can correctly start before another class's AfterClass method has been called.

    <body>Just for the record; Spring's SpringJUnit4ClassRunner is not thread safe without the patch in (vote please!). We use stub-wired spring tests for running unit tests of gui-layer controls, which is a really nice way to avoid 10 tons of mocks and/or redundant construction of "hard to construct" classes. We also use spring in our selenium tests. So there are different use cases that may have value with spring; we run all of these tests concurrently. Judging by this discussion it seems to me like documentation on the concurrency features probably needs to be created/updated, since the visibility of these features seem to be limited. I am also not sure if the design is final in any real way. As for the design; I think the current implementation allows a "ParalellComputer" to choose between a "queue of tasks" approach or any other solution. I think this is a real benefit; I can easily see scenarios where an external source actually wants to control the allocation of threading resources to a given test runner ( a concurrent multi-module maven build would be one such case, where an external scheduler would prioritize different modules)  ith.html Kristian ti., 02.03.2010 kl. 08.31 -0500, skrev Loritsch, Berin C.:</body>

    <header>RE: [RT] JUnit Core, Parallelism, Documentation</header>
    <body>Well, getting to the core, it is not very clear what is the _internal_ API and what is the _external_ API.  For something like JUnit there are actually two external APIs to worry about: *         The API for Test Writers *         The API for IDE/tool writers The JavaDocs do have to be very clear on what is likely to change, and what is meant to be stable.  This approach allows you to clean up cruft over time. The first misstep I saw was the move from using the Description object to build the tree of tests to using a Plan to build the tree of tests. The addChild() and getChildren() methods of the Description object are deprecated, yet JUnit creates the Plan from the description object.  I believe that the new direction of using a Plan instead of a hierarchy of descriptions is the correct one from a conceptual standpoint. The API for testers is pretty well understood, and I would be very resistant to arbitrarily changing that.  I think most people would be as well. What is less understood is where JUnit is designed to integrate with IDEs and tool vendors.  How much of the Computer/Plan/Filtering/Ordering do we want to expose?  What are we confident with?  The rest, as they say, making sure our internals work with that spec.  None of the internals should rely on deprecated features.  Anything in the "internal" package should be considered, by definition, internal.  That means anything in there that is deprecated should be free to be removed. At least, this is how I've evolved libraries before (I've worked on a few Apache projects in the past).

Perhaps it's a bad smell in design, but capturing end-of-all-tests event would be very helpful for applications like this one (to generate summaries, charts, etc.).

    <header>RE: JUnitBenchmarks (application of @Rule)</header>
    <body>I started a new project to flesh out my ideas from the RT I posted last week that might fit this solution well.  In essence, the project I started is intended for QoS testing (Quality of Service) which I define as correctness under duress.  I havenât gotten very far, but at least Iâve gotten it to the place where it can run its own tests and the result events are processed in a separate thread. On a minor side note, when the bulk of your tests are short and do not involve a lot of objects, you can see as much as 100% speed gains.  Essentially, by short I mean less than a millisecond in duration.  The speed gains are achieved by not penalizing the tests while you write to the console.  In more substantive tests you will not see as much of a speed gain. Essentially the QoS testing framework will have some hooks to specify numbers of runs, parameters, etc.  My hope is that at the very least there can be a symbiotic relationship between the projects.  I think it would be really cool for the two to even merge one day.  However, testing for benchmarks and quality of service is a little different from regular unit testing. Also note: for more accurate test timing, use the System.nanoTime().  Most JVM implementations only increment the system clock every 10ms.  Thatâs fine enough for telling the time, but when your individual tests are typically faster than 10ms that lack of granularity can hurt. I would be very interested in what kind of needs you may have.

    <header>Thoughts on Suites in modern testing</header>
    <body>When JUnit first started out, there really wasn't any way to collect all the tests without writing a Suite.  Now Ant, Maven, and other build tools collect all the test classes and execute them.  Essentially, the usefulness of test Suites has been greatly diminished.  The problem that the build tools answered quite nicely was the fact that manually maintaining the test suites can be a problem.  People routinely forget to add test classes to the test suites, and it's not a question of laziness.  It's just a question of it being that "one more thing" to remember that is so easily overlooked. The Categories test runner provides a nice extension to Suites that give them some value again.  However, I'd like to make use of them without explicitly listing all the classes included in the suite.  Essentially, I'd either like the Categories test runner to collect all the test classes itself and apply the category filters, or have that built into the main JUnit runner.  Adding support for a class collector is possible, and may even be preferable in today's testing. Currently some projects keep unit tests, slow tests, and installation tests in separate directory structures so that Ant or whatever build tool they choose can run them separately.  Categories will allow these projects to clearly mark the tests, possibly even assigning multiple categories to the tests.  This provides great flexibility in how things are run. Of course, this includes corresponding support in ANT to execute the proper categories, or at the very least call the Categories test suites we've set up.  Since JUnit takes care of collecting the classes for us, it makes leveraging that support as simple as calling a single test case which all the build tools already support.

    <header>RE: C unit testing framework?</header>
    <body>Hi David, Is there any obstacle to using a C++ framework to test the C code? If all testing is on a desktop platform, I'd guess not, but if you need to run tests on an embedded platform it would depend on what cross-compilers are available. Assuming you can use a C++ framework, my own current favorites are CPPUnitLite for apps with an embedded component and Google test for desktop apps. CPPUnitLite is also a good choice if you expect to modify the framework, because it's small - and expects you to modify it. BTW, I think the differences between JUnit and any C/C++ framework are much bigger than the differences between the individual frameworks, so the team will have a lot to unlearn/learn no matter what the choice.

    <body>When writing tests, one verifies expected behavior by writing assertions. Assertions are method calls, (e.g. assertTrue, assertEquals, and many others explained in against values produced by the test.  They throw AssertionFailedError when a particular condition is not met. The exception you got shows that the following assertion failed: There are three arguments to this assertEquals assertion. First, the string is a message that is printed when the assertion fails. The messages are usually used to help with debugging by describing what an assertion does in a human-readable way.  The second argument is the expected value and the third is the actual value. In your example, the arguments are backward. It is most common for the expected side to be a literal (in this case a String) and the actual side to be the result of the computation that you want to test. Back to your error. When assertEqual fails, it shows the string values of the expected and actual sides to again aid in debugging. Therefore, the exception you got is telling you that the getVariable method returned null when it should have instead returned the string "Going to the first state!-auction". The test has failed and you need to start debugging to find out why.

    <header>RE: Re: SureFire Plugin: "parallel" attribute</header>
    <body>I assume you have one or two @Test(timeout=1050) in your code? Each timeout test spawns another thread in which the actual test is performed.  The timing is maintained in the current thread that is executing the other tests in the class.  One of the caveats with running testing in parallel is that the actual time spent within the thread is longer than if the tests were run sequentially.  That's because you are utilizing more of your computer's resources at once.  It could very well be that if your timeout tests were barely passing before, it is enough of a difference to cause you problems now.

Would I be safe to download this and add it to our internal maven repo?  Also, Just out of curiosity, what happens thread count wise when you aren't using ConfigurableParallelComputer, does it literally fire up a thread per test? D/ I'm not too worried about my tests, as they all run on isolated data sets. We are still build them up... I think the thing you're missing is that maven surefire 2.5 works with JUST junit 4.7+ or a *combination* of junit 4.7+ /and/ ConfigurableParallelComputer. When using surefire with junit /alone/ it does not support threadCount. You will need to use the /combination/ to restrict threadCount. Since you're a selenium user you WILL need to limit threads, which means you *cannot* get by with just junit 4.7+, but you *will* need ConfigurableParallelComputer. I will update the surefire docs to be a bit clearer on this restriction. I know at least three selenium projects that are doing exactly what you want. Most run with parallel=classes and a thread restriction, since this allows a smooth number of concurrent tests, something that is good for your grid. My current firefox runs went from 45 minutes single thread to 8 minutes concurrent, so there's definitely a huge upside. This does not mean it's a simple task, since most selenium test suites are not written with concurrency support in mind. Quite frankly, if you think getting surefire/junit to work is hard you can rest assured that the worst part is still ahead of you.</body>

    <header>@DataPoints called several times for Theories</header>
    <body>I created a set of theories to verify the equals(), hashCode() relationship.  While I had the equals and reciprocal equals working properly, I was surprised at the unintended hashCode collisions I had in my code.  More importantly I was surprised at how often the @DataPoints method was called to set up the tests.  It was called no less than 61 times for 60 discrete data points.  That seems a bit excessive to me. I set up a bunch of data with the assumption that it was set up once, and then the contents were copied as needed.  Essentially the expensive set up work is done 61 times, accounting for a large portion of the 37 seconds it takes to run all my tests.  If the @DataPoints method is only called once, and the values are copied as necessary, then the implementation would be much faster.</body>

    <header>RE: Re: SureFire Plugin: "parallel" attribute</header>
    <body>Something is serializing your traffic. We do this on /windows/ rc's with firefox. I do it every day using just maven + rc + firefox on my local machine. Browser windows are exploding all over the place. I am almost certain your problem lies within your junit+selenium fixture. Please make sure that you need to have one instance of the Selenium object PER THREAD within the junit fixtures, and you must do thread-based browser instance management within your code. While not exactly rocket science, it's not the kind of code you write without any well-defined use-case. Since you only managed to get running with threads or so yesterday I wouldn't be expecting this code to be ready today ;) You *could* make multiple bindings of the surefire mojo in maven and fork multiple executions, still using the same scheme. Our "critical" chain is about 10 minutes long and involves unit tests, concurrent integration tests and concurrent selenium tests on firefox. The thing is that we have a quite long build chain, with a short critical chain. Getting Selenium tests to run 24/7 stable on 3 browser families is pretty darn close to an art form. So if you mash 30-40 minutes "linear time" testing with 3-4 browsers into one huge build, you'll simply never get a green build. IE is mostly going to be linear time anyway. But I would advise you to keep your ambitions low regarding running everything as one big pile. If you decompose into per-browser modules, you can just let your CI server build these in parallel instead. And all the browser that support it run multi-threaded within the builds. If you use maven profiles you can suppress most non-selenium related stuff in the builds running selenium tests. Kristian</body>

    <body>Berin, Charlie may already have said it all better than I can, so I'll try a brief summary. Parameterized tests are an answer key: a = 3, b =  4 =&amp;gt; foo(a,b) = 5 a = 5, b = 12 =&amp;gt; foo(a,b) = 13 a = 0, b =  4 =&amp;gt; foo(a,b) = 4 Theories are a universal truth: a^2 + b^2 = foo(a,b)^2 Sometimes answer keys are easier to write than universal truths.  If you are using parameterized tests as a way to supply examples to a universal truth, please log a bug about why it was hard to do with Theories.  :-)  Thanks, On Fri, Feb 12, 2010 at 2:12 PM, Loritsch, Berin C.</body>

    <header>Vote for Discrete Theories</header>
    <body>A while back I posted some changes I would like to see to make using Theories to test interface contracts more useful.  Essentially, this includes recording each run of the theory as a separate test.  I've prepared a patch to make it possible, and to get it applied I need your support.  The way it works is that you mark the theory you want to be recorded separately like this: @DataPoints @Theory(runDiscretely=true) If you have 6 data points, your test results will have 6 tests recorded like this: myTheory[1] = passed myTheory[2] = passed myTheory[3] = failed myTheory[5] = passed myTheory[8] = failed myTheory[13] = passed The advantage of this approach is that each failure is recorded separately.  When you are evaluating a number of implementations of the interface, you can find all the failures in one pass instead of fixing one failure to reveal another. Additionally, the value in the square brackets can be customized with the toString() method of your objects under test.  The test names are built with String.valueOf() on the data point value (handles null as well).  This works well when you dynamically build the data points in a method like the example I provided above.  Without this solution, the only clue is in the exception thrown which gives you the name of the @DataPoints method (fibonnacciSeries) and the index ([2]) with the first failure above.  The patch I have does not remove this functionality, so you have both solutions available.  The discrete test name includes the String value of the object and the exception thrown gives you the name of the data point and index (if applicable). If you believe that this will be helpful, vote for the issue at the beginning of the email.  If you want to try it out, you can get it from github here:</body>

    <body>Berin, When a theory mutates data points, it might be beneficial to recreate the data point for every theory invocation. Doing so prevents one theory execution from affecting others. I wrote about this issue in the following weblog post: You are correct, though, that copying would avoid some of the overhead in calling datapoint methods. It is interesting you mention this idea, because I am currently overseeing two students who for their senior thesis project are implementing framework for copying datapoints.

    <body>Yes, a method of the same as the variable is declared public. eg, Will result in a public method foo() So I suppose BlockJUnit4ClassRunner#rules, ruleFields, createRules,  could be overriden to use FrameworkMethod. While that would not require classpath hack I'm currently using to override BlockJUnit4ClassRunner, it would still require putting a @RunWith annotation on every test, no? It would be so much nicer if junit could be configurable without having to pollute all the tests with this implementation detail. Having said that I'm not sure on what approach would be appropriate and lightweight to extend/modify the internals of junit in this way.

    <header>Re: @DataPoints called several times for Theories</header>
    <body>I agree with your prognosis, about fresh data points for testing the theories. That is precisely why I proposed reading them once, and cloning them (making a copy) as needed for each theory.  With that approach we even get the protection from mutated data points when you use the @DataPoint to mark a static field. Cloning is a much quicker operation, does not execute any constructors.  It merely copies the contents of the object memory verbatim. With the current implementation, if you are not prepared for the combinatorial affect of 60 data points combined with 60 data points for each theory there is a major disconnect.  The majority of the overhead in this particular scenario has to do with creating objects (with the additional overhead of doing it by reflection). When I created only one instance of each class instead of two, the performance was twice as fast (i.e. 37 seconds down to about 16 seconds). Essentially the number of times your @DataPoints method is called depends on the number of parameters in your @Theory and how many theories you have. Essentially the formula for my theory (ha, ha) of the execution is like this: N^(p-1) + 1 where: N is the number of data points returned by the method p is the number of parameters and the + 1 represents the run where the data point is read the first time So for 60 data points it is run 61 times for two parameters.  With three parameters it would be called 3601 times.  I have to verify with three parameters.  The theory is called N^p times for sure and that is expected. With the above formula, the mapping of number of calls to parameters for 60 data points would be: 1 -&amp;gt; 2 (I know this is wrong which gives me doubts on the formula) 2 -&amp;gt; 61 3 -&amp;gt; 3601 3 -&amp;gt; 216001 Essentially when the Assignments class needs to make the combinations, it will collect the data points initially for each theory.  It then calls the data points again for each existing data point it collected from the first read. With a third parameter it would take all those combinations again, to add all the permutations for the next round. I might be wrong and the real formula would be like this: N^0 + N^1 ... + N^(p-1) If this is the correct formula, then if you have 60 data points the number of times the method is called would map to the number of parameters like this: 1 -&amp;gt; 1 2 -&amp;gt; 61 3 -&amp;gt; 3661 4 -&amp;gt; 219661</body>

    <header>Putting all your JUnit tests in separate Eclipse project?</header>
    <body>Hi, Has anyone out there tried moving all of your JUnit test cases into a separate Eclipse project, rather than keeping them within your main project? I couldn't find any info on this option when I searched on google for "junit separate eclipse project" and "junit different eclipse project". I looked through the JUnit FAQ, and found this:  ...which describes having parallel source folders within the same project -- one for main code, and one for test code. But nothing found about having separate projects. I see the following advantages in having a separate Eclipse project for the JUnit tests: 1) The ability to set your project-specific settings for your test project to something other than what is set for the main project. Not all project settings are available in the runtime configs (such as builder configurations), and so moving the test code to a separate project would allow for setting whatever test-specific project settings are desired. The main project can be added as a project dependency of the test project, and so the parallel source dirs design can still exist and the test project can continue to access all of the main project's code. 2) Reduced risk in having your main code accidentally depend on a test (not likely to happen, but possible with single project). 3) Reduced risk in accidentally shipping test-specific jars with your production code. 4) The freedom to add any version of a lib that you need for your tests. For example, let's say that your main code depends on google-collections-0.9.jar. And your tests can benefit from some new method introduced in a new version -- google-collection-1.0.jar. So, you'd like to use v1.0 with your test code but don't want to touch the main code's libs. If you have a separate test project, then that's not a problem -- you just add v1.0 to the test project's lib dir. But if you have a single main project that includes your test code, then your either stuck with v0.9 -- or you'll have to use a custom classloader to load your entire test code (and the test-specific libs) so that you can load v1.0 and not v0.9. I'd say that the separate-project-option would do well when needing test-specific project settings and with dealing with transitive dependencies. For the disadvantages of having a separate project, I can't think of any besides: 1) Having one more project to maintain. Is that really a disadvantage, though? Maybe. Can you list any other disadvantages? Maybe a more fundamental question is: Should an eclipse project that contains your production code (and jars used by your production code at runtime) also contain non-production code (eg, test code and test-specific jars) or should non-production code+artifacts be placed in a separate Eclipse project while still maintaining a parallel dir structure for tests? I welcome all your thoughts! Thank you. Cheers, Will</body>

    <header>Re: Putting all your JUnit tests in separate Eclipse project?</header>
    <body>Hi, Will. Since you said you welcome our thoughts, let me share/compare to how we do it.. We use Maven, and m2eclipse. Maven, by convention, locates 'production' source code under "src/main/java" and test source code under "src/test/java". m2eclipse then sets up two separate source paths under the same Eclipse project. 1) The ability to set your project-specific settings for your test project to something other than what is set for the main project. As you know, run-time configuration can be configured per test/suite under Eclipse. Using Maven, you can specify some run-time configuration that'll only get applied when running (all) unit tests. I'm not sure why you'd need separate build configuration, except for your point #4: libraries only needed for unit tests, which I'll get to below. 2) Reduced risk in having your main code accidentally depend on a test (not likely to happen, but possible with single project). When Maven to perform the final build, the 'compile' phase executes before the 'compile tests' phase; If any production code has hard dependencies on test code then the compile will fail. Eclipse won't raise any errors at all, though; so we need to depend on the Maven build to catch this situation. 3) Reduced risk in accidentally shipping test-specific jars with your production code. Again, like in #2 by using the Maven build we cleanly separate the production code from test code. 4) The freedom to add any version of a lib that you need for your tests. To a large extent, Maven lets you use a separate build classpath for tests and production code. You can certainly specify libraries with only "test scope". You can even use different test resources (e.g., configuration .properties or .XML files, test data/fixtures) which are all invisible to the production code. However, I'm unsure of how it'll work if you use a different or newer version of the same dependency in your test scope. The Maven-Eclipse project certainly doesn't complainâbut again, I suspect Maven will (properly) fail to compile if your test code which was written against the old library is broken by the new test library. Overall, Maven+Eclipse is not 100% ideal compared to what you seem to want to accomplish using separate projects. It does, however, let us separate test code and production code with relative ease, without having to manage two separate projects. The best part is how the whole compile, test, package, distribute and deploy cycle can be configured/managed using a single tool, which can even be run in an automated fashion (within a continuous integration system). Using Eclipse alone, with two separate projects, you'd have to manually run tests in the test project, before building the main project (or write your own script to do so), and so on by hand. Hope this helps. - alistair --</body>

    <header>When to use parameterized tests vs. theories?</header>
    <body>I know I'm a little slow on the uptake, but I'm asking these questions so that I can formulate how I'm going to mentor my team to make the most of their testing investment. There is a certain amount of overlap between parameterized tests and but they provide a little more control over how things get matched up. Of course, theories allow for much more robust data sets by combining all the data points in every way.  This can provide an order of magnitude more tests automatically, but care has to be taken.  For example, the number of actual tests run is D^P where D is the number of data points and P is the number of parameters on any given theory.  This can generate a lot of tests quickly, and the "runDiscretely" option I hacked together for theories would definitely not be a preferable. I now know that assumptions are filtering devices for theories, so it does not mark the test as failed.  Essentially, the reason that an assumption is marked as passing for the theory is that the assumption successfully filtered out that data combination.  I get that now, but I probably will use that feature very sparingly. The question I have is what problem was the reason parameterized tests supposed to solve, and how is that different than the problem that theories are supposed to solve?</body>

    <header>Re: When to use parameterized tests vs. theories?</header>
    <body>If my understanding is correct, there is definitely an overlap between parameterized tests and theories. Theories generate a set of tuples representing the combination of a data set, while parameterized can return... well, any data set.  From that angle, theories are a subset of parameterized tests, and as such, might have been better off implemented as a utility function rather than a full fledged feature. -- Cedric -- ***Cédric *</body>

  <mail>
    <header>Re: When to use parameterized tests vs. theories?</header>
    <body>My basic understanding of the _practical_ difference between them is that parameterized tests have more restrictions on how the data is set up.  For example, parameterized tests have an array of arrays, each internal array is a set of parameters to apply to the test.  Essentially, there is more onus on the test writer to know what parameters are important to test, and how they are supposed to relate. Theories have much less restrictions on the data, and instead force the test writer to focus on the function of the theory independent of the data.  That's a good thing IMO. My guess is that parameterized tests came first, and because of the limitations it forced on the test writer theories came later.  That is only a guess. In some ways I would like to pair the expected result with the passed in parameter, but that solution requires a parameterized test.  In most applications, I care more about the behavior of a class implementing an interface, or something of that nature. What I'm missing here is what is the _philosophical_ difference?</body>

    <header>Re: Putting all your JUnit tests in separate Eclipse project?</header>
    <body>My cheap two cents... I really like the parallel source-test code convention. Could you explain "project-specific settings for your test project" a little more.  When I test, I want to be able to configure the environment of my code as much as possible.  My test code creates many different situations for my code under test.  This way I know that my code under test can perform in different scenarios.  To enable this ability, I like to limit my configuration, so my code under test is as nimble as possible.  It should work under many configurations and not depend "too much" on resource files, project configurations, the weather, a specific server... I think number 2 &amp;amp; 3 are the same.  Where I work, we are leaning towards shipping the test code in our distributable.  It is an option to install, which shows the confidence we have in our code base.  All the tests pass, and you know what's under test will work.  I've seen some companies required to show coverage analysis along with the tests to prove the code is exercised before it is installed. We are lucky that our customer is internal. For reason number 4...  If I had to maintain two sets of libraries, I'd have problems figuring out which version of a jar I'm using.  Especially when my test code calls into my code under test with one of the shared jars.  (Is this the "jar hell" many speak of?)  If one follows the apache version number conventions... there are problems with changing the x and y numbers in a x.y.z version scheme between projects. Why should the test code have additional functionality that the code under test can't.  Is the test code performing the same work as the production code.  I like to limit my test code to set up, tear down, and assertions logic.  If I'm doing something that the code under test should do, I wonder why it is so hard to test.  (In those cases maybe I wrote a bad API for myself.) Basically, when it comes down to it... I'm lazy and hate having to set up two environments.  I already pull my hair out when ant and eclipse function differently because someone, &amp;lt;cough "myself"/&amp;gt; forgets to make the classpaths match.</body>

    <header>Re: Maven SureFire - parallel attribute</header>
    <body>The "Computer" architecture in Junit 4.7+ is open to extension, and the ConfigurableParallelComputer provides the ability to run with a limited number of threads, as well as more efficient thread handling than the junit 4.7+ "ParallelComputer". Especially users of multi-module maven builds will find the threading models in junit 4.7 ParallelComputer to be quite slow. There is a fairly decent unit test within lob/master/src/test/java/org/jdogma/junit/JUnitCorePerformanceTest.java#\ L83 behaviour of JunitCore combined with ConfigurableParallelComputer . I am not sure if the same kind of test exists for ParallelComputer within Junit, but his test case could easily be extended to cover that as well. Remember that both surefire and ConfigurableParallelComputer contain demultiplexing run listeners that make output appear in "correct order" (the one in ConfigurableParallelComputer being somewhat better than the one in Surefire ATM) I always found in my own testing that the problem with "methods" is that the run-time of the individual test methods is fairly small part of the entire test run-time (classloading and setup taking most of the time), and I have never been able to get much of a speed improvement out of "methods". "classes" is also usually a lot safer &amp;amp; easier to get running. I  am reasonably sure that "methods" works in the surefire-2.5+junit4.8.1+ConfigurableParallelComputer combination, but I'll definitiely accept surprises. Any specific issues should be filed either with ConfigurableParallelComputer at github or the apache surefire issue tracker.</body>

    <header>Re: SureFire Plugin: "parallel" attribute</header>
    <body>Cedric emailed me offline, about TestNG, but does JUnit work at all in parallel? I posted this to the maven list but didn't get an answer. Perhaps someone here can help? plugin docs? to run all your test methods in separate threads, except for methods that depend on each other, which will be run in the same thread in order to respect their order of execution. as controlled by threadCount. synchronously, however when I set parallel = classes, it runs the classes in parallel. I haven't been able to find good documentation for this anywhere.. Does anybody know of any good resources? or does it run the methods in parallel by class? i.e. 1 class at a time but all the methods in that class are parallel? I.E. I've read a little bit on ConfigurableParallelComputer but I'm not sure what it's all about..</body>

    <header>RE: Re: When to use parameterized tests vs. theories?</header>
    <body>Hi, Think of a test as a set of predicates that have to return true in order for the test to succeed. Think of a theory as two sets of predicates, one set having to return true in order for the theory to even be applicable and another set that works just as for tests. Now add data... Normal tests can either introduce data as parameters or internally. We call the former parameterized tests. We don't seem to have any special name for the latter. I use the term test case for the combination of a test (set of predicates) with a single set of parameters to which it is applied. In theory &amp;lt;g&amp;gt; Theories could also introduce data internally, but this doesn't seem very practical. So theories are parameterized in practice, if not by nature. This tends to make them look like parameterized tests when viewed from outside. And of course, the implementation of a parameterized test in an xUnit-style is typically a method with arguments. The implementation of a Theory is also a method with arguments. Again, this makes them look like the same thing - or as if a Theory is a specialization of a parameterized test. I don't think that's the case. Or at least I don't think it's the most useful way to view things. Dr. Who looks human, but he has two hearts. Those two sets of predicates at the heart of a Theory are what make it what it is. We could say - in either case - that the doctor/theory is a subset of humans/parameterized-tests, with the addition of some extra functionality, but this only makes sense at a very superficial level. Use parameterized tests if you have a set of examples you need to make work. Use Theories... well... if you have a theory that needs to be demonstrated. In some kinds of work, we start with a theory. In other kinds, we start with examples and have to work our way toward a mental model. IME, the former is more typical in implementing algorithms while the latter is more typical of business programming. Also IME, premature speculation about the underlying theory/model, rather than just listening to the customer, is a pretty common anti-pattern. Fair warning: what I know about Theories is based on my interpretation of some of David's papers and my efforts to implement it in NUnit, where it (a) works pretty well and (b) is poorly understood by most users. I'm generally familiar with how the JUnit implementation works, but I don't know all the intimate details. Charlie</body>

    <body>I think the thing you're missing is that maven surefire 2.5 works with JUST junit 4.7+ or a *combination* of  junit 4.7+ /and/ ConfigurableParallelComputer. When using surefire with junit /alone/ it does not support threadCount. You will need to use the /combination/ to restrict threadCount. Since you're a selenium user you WILL need to limit threads, which means you *cannot* get by with just junit 4.7+, but you *will* need ConfigurableParallelComputer. I will update the surefire docs to be a bit clearer on this restriction. I know at least three selenium projects that are doing exactly what you want. Most run with parallel=classes and a thread restriction, since this allows a smooth number of concurrent tests, something that is good for your grid. My current firefox runs went from 45 minutes single thread to 8 minutes concurrent, so there's definitely a huge upside.

    <body>Install, or if your internal requirements mandate it, build from source. It's only about 4-5 pages of code to read it all if you're security concerned. The test failure basically tells me you have the slowest computer to ever run these tests ;) Or, as the javadocs from the test-class say: /** * These tests assert that the expected peformance of classes/methods/both. * * While the occasional glitch in computing power can make these tests fail (if actual time exceeds expected + 33%), * the lower bound should *never* be violated. * * These tests usually fail if run in a debugger, due to the changed timings. * */ using ConfigurableParallelComputer, does it literally fire up a thread per test? Yes, in "methods" mode it's one thread per test method. Classes mode is one per class. Both is, well, both. In my 10+ years as test-infected, I have really never ever had a use-case where this kind of solution would be appropriate (maybe some kind of really slow database with unlimited cheap connections). With thousands of test classes you come to a grinding halt with any of these options. grid with windows? We are having a hell of a time getting &amp;gt;that working too. We have the hub on Ubuntu and windows slaves don't &amp;gt;play nice but Ubuntu slaves work fine. I haven't found much info on &amp;gt;the issues we are seeing nor have a I gotten any responses on the &amp;gt;Selenium mailing list. We may just have to skip IE testing for now &amp;gt;and running everything on firefox Ubuntu. We run all our browser-bots on windows, and the CI is bamboo on linux. We do not use grid. Instead we let a single build run with 4 threads towards a single instance of selenium RC (with firefox). This has proved to be a nice, stable setup that gives us a lot of punch. Now we also partition the entire build into 2, so we have two separate (Windows) pizza boxes running RC+ firefox, for a grand total of 8 available browsers. This allows us to use firefox as the backbone in our selenium-TDD-based development that has allowed us virtually regression free frequent deployments. We run Internet Explorer and Opera on separate boxes. Opera Selenium tests are hard to make stable, but they also work concurrently. Internet Exploder is a strict one-instance per box for any kind of stability. I know some people use virtualization. We just add boxes. The other projects do much the same, but they all pre-date grid somewhat. We're also planning to try out Chrome once we upgrade to Selenium 2.0, we really need something webkit based. Kristian</body>

With thousands of test classes you come to a grinding halt with any of these options. Well I'll be 100% correct here, it does not fire one thread per test. It  makes one CachedThreadPool per test class, and schedules runnables on it. Unfortunately the CachedThreadPool is not designed to be used this way, and it needs to be shut down properly or each instance will stay around for 60 seconds consuming more resources. So if you have 500 tests with 5 methods each in one module you'll have a maximum of 2500 threads running in 500 instances of CachedThreadPool; and currently those 2500 threads will stay around for a minute. This is actually a lot less efficient than just doing new Thread(runnable).start(), which is also a bit crazy. But there's no point in bashing the default implementation; it's extensible and user-modifyable - which is really the important thing. Actually, I suppose at some point in time Kent/David make up their mind about how to solve issue 18. I've spent quite a lot of time refining the CPC and they're more than welcome to supplement/replace ParallelComputer with my implementation. Just remember to vote for issue 18 ;) you distribute the tests to them? These are "sensible default values" in our environment and we just invoke maven with overriding values on our build box: mvn -Dselenium.rc.server=firstrcbox.com -Dselenium.browser=*opera install The we just have a number of automatic builds that are triggered by commit hooks. I know it's not very glorious, but it works really well in the trenches. Kristian</body>
