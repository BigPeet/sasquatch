    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Character to Entities for javadoc</header>
    <body>Hi, While editing java code, I miss a function like "Plugin&amp;gt;Xml&amp;gt;Characters to Entities" to include accented characters in my javadoc. But this function is not available for java mode and I did not find the same function in another plugin nor in a macro. Any idea about the best approach ? Michaël</body>

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Character to Entities for javadoc</header>
    <body>What would you like ? numeric encoding, like &amp;amp;#e9, accepted in all XML documents; or html entities, like &amp;amp;eacute; ? In both cases, XMLPlugin can certainly be extended to not be so picky about the current mode : to their escaped notation I'm in favour of the first solution, since it will never create meaningless entities. By any way, please register a plugin feature request... Best regards, Le 27/01/10 21:53, Michaël Michaud a écrit :</body>

    <body>Hi Thanks for answering I'm not an xml/html expert. I know that html entities work fine for javadoc. Never tried numeric entities, but from what I read, it should work. First solution seems OK (not sure what your second solution means) OK, done. Michaël PS : surfing a bit on internet about this problem, I just read that javadoc should understand unicode escape characters like \u0040 ... and jEdit has a good macro to escape unicode characters ;-)/ /</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] jEdit never appears if ftp server is dead</header>
    <body>I have been tracking down a problem where I launch jEdit, and the editor never appears on the screen.  I think I understand (partly) what's happening. I am using the FTP and sessions plugins.  When I last closed down jEdit, all of the files it had open were on an SFTP server.  The server has apparently died (I just tried to log into it using another program, and confirmed that it's not up). I managed to get jEdit running (and appearing on my screen) by temporarily moving the files in .jedit/jar to a temp dir (that was probably overkill, but at the time I didn't know what was going on).  If from this running instance of jEdit, I try to open a file on the dead server, it eventually times out, giving an I/O Error, as it should.  But AFAICT, if jEdit tries to open files on this server at jEdit's startup, it never times out. I have to admit that I'm not sure that it *never* times out.  It was trying to open around 15 files on the dead server; so if it did this in sequence, waiting for each file to time out before trying the next, I suppose maybe I didn't wait long enough, although I did wait an awfully long time.  Still, if that's what's happening, it would be nice if it would display *something* (like the editor itself, and individual I/O error msgs); otherwise, it appears as if jEdit is simply dead. This is jEdit 4.3 server mode, Java 1.6.0_17, Windows Vista SP2. --</body>

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] jEdit never appears if ftp server is dead</header>
    <body>Maybe you should make a bug entry about this issue. Just some hints for the usage. You can set up jEdit to not restore remote files on startup to prevent a dead FTP server from causing jEdit not to start up. This setting you can also simply change in ~/.jedit/properties by searching for the entry "restore.remote=" and setting it to false. And instead of moving the contents of ~/.jedit/jars, you can simply use the command line option "-noplugins" to start jEdit without loading any plugins. Alternately you could use the command line option "-norestore" no open jEdit without reopening any previously opened files for that invocation. Mike Maxwell schrieb:</body>

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Creating/adding new template files in

    <body>If I remember correctly the SuperAbbrevs templates are simply serialized Java Maps. The easiest way to create new templates is to use the plugin's options interface. Go to "Plugins" -&amp;gt; "Plugin Options" -&amp;gt; "SuperAbbrevs": "Abbreviations". Select the mode you want, Eg. actionscript, and click the "Add..." button at the bottom (The little plus sign). Detailed instructions on creating abbreviations are included with the plugin. "Help" -&amp;gt; "jEdit Help (F1)" -&amp;gt; "Plugins": SuperAbbrevs. You might find it helpful to write the template in a new jEdit buffer first, then copy and paste it into the Abbreviation Creation window.

    <body>Failure continues with version 43pre16. There is a bug preventing use of latest version. Further testing is required. Other java programs do not fail hence coding error within jedit most likely cause. Suggest full testing with various java vendors Reverting to 43pre11. If there is a version between 11 and 16 please send and I'll test. 10:20:37 [main] [warning] PluginJAR: Ignoring: de.iqcomputing.jedit.irc.IRCBotPlugin 10:20:41 [AWT-EventQueue-0] [error]

It has been stated many times in the past on the mailing lists and in the forums that jEdit works best with the Sun SDK. Perhaps this should be added to the jEdit.org website under the download section, as you suggest.

That is why it is not starting correctly. I would recommend using the platform-independent install jar and installing it AS your own user IN your user directory and running that instead. Then at least you won't have any permissions issues and can run the thing. You haven't said anywhere how you installed 4.3 in the first place. Was it a deb or a jar file? And I don't care if you can "start up" an older previously installed version of jEdit. All that means is that you installed it once correctly before. Finally, you might want to start with clean settings in your ~/.jedit directory. If the installer has a bug, you need to give a descriptive bug report that is helpful, otherwise it won't ever get fixed. None of the developers run the installer on a regular basis so we don't see bugs there as often as new users do.</body>

    <body>Hi, I think "jedit-users" is meant for discussing jedit usage. If you'd like to report bugs, please do it the formal way - using the SourceForge tracker for jEdit:  When you report a bug, please specify the actions you did to produce it. If the bug is associated with an exception, it is very useful to attach the "activity.log" file to the item, sometimes also  the "properties" files which indicate your jEdit settings. Both files reside in the jEdit home directory. Regards, Shlomy On Fri, Jan 15, 2010 at 2:41 PM, e-letter &amp;lt;inpost@...&amp;gt; wrote:</body>

This behaviour is observed on four machines. Currently I don't have any other Java applications, only jEdit. Maybe there's a smallish Java application I could install to run some tests?  Maybe someone out there can hack one together quickly?

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] filemanagers invoke jEdit, but text file not loaded</header>
    <body>This question was asked a few days ago in the Troubleshooting forum, but without any replies, so I thought I'd ask it again here. I've been using jEdit 4.3pre14 under Max OS X.4.11 (Tiger), and it has worked fine.  Very recently I moved to OS X.6.2 (Snow Leopard), which uses Java 1.6.0_17, and installed jEdit 4.3 Stable.  It works okay except for a couple of peculiarities: * using any one of the 3 file managers - Finder, Path Finder, muCommandrr - when I double-click on a text file, jEdit comes up but the text file it- self is not loaded into it.  The file has to be loaded with C-o. * when I load a file to edit I can Paste any one of the items in the multi- item clipboard (Jumpcut), but once I select and Copy some text in the file, only that item is pasted regardless of the which item I actually chose in the clipboard.  If I close that window and reload the file from the Recent list, I can again Paste any item I want from the clipboard. Anyone have any ideas what might be going one with either of these mis- behaviors, or suggestions for where to investigate?  Thanks. - Dushan</body>

Probably the file name is not passed from the file manager to this shortcut.

    <body>Hi Jim, settings. To do this you need to delete the "properties" and "perspective.xml" file under your jEdit settings directory. On Ubuntu, this is usually found under ~/.jedit Note that, you can safely remove anything under that directory without affecting jEdit core, but if you delete the "jars" directory you will wipe out your plugins as well.

But it is not available via the plugin manager and both the last release date and the requirements seems to indicate that it is abandonned.

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Files not closing</header>
    <body>Often when I close a modified file and elect not to save changes, I get prompted again about my unsaved changes when I go to quit jEdit. I don't see the file in my list of buffers, but I may still receive notifications if another program modifies it - as if jEdit still has it open but hidden. Anyone else have this problem?

    <body>In general I agree, but I think that before we do that, the Updater plugin user interface should be simpler and more friendly, e.g. a progress dialog with a "More" button to show the text pane. Currently the text pane is all it provides. Shlomy 2010/1/13 Eric Berry &amp;lt;elberry@...&amp;gt;:</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Switching between buffers</header>
    <body>Hi I have been using Eclipse for a while, and in Eclipse, if you press Ctrl+Tab, it brings up a list of all the open files in the editor, with the current file first, then the previous one, then the one active before that and so on. I've become used to this, and I still use Eclipse a lot when editing php-code. But one project I code using jEdit, and I really miss this functionality. I can find/set shortcuts to switch to the previous buffer, this makes the current buffer the 'previous' buffer, thus, I can switch between two buffers easily. But, I would really like a shortcut to switch buffers sort of like the Eclipse-method. I've tried different buffer-switching plugins, but I cannot get any of them to switch like this. The bufferlist plugin can switch between open buffers using a shortcut, but it always go to the next or previous buffer in the list, and the list is not reordered when a buffer is activated. -- Mads Lie Jensen - mads@... - ICQ #25478403 Gartneriet -</body>

    <body>No keyboard ninja I know uses WYSIWYG tools :-) To be serious, it is realy a great feature. Example showing use in HTML coding is just one thing. Extended as abbrev. on other languages - it provides fast and handy way for rapid development. HTML coding benefits in a way that CSS file/file part provides sort of a "clip storage". Extended to any other language we could have elegant way of defining clips of source in external file (or even in the source file!) and then quickly "paste" any clip in any source file within project (or directory for simple projects not using say project plugin) Just my toughts.

    <body>Some WYSIWYG editors are easier to use than others, and some are more powerful than others, but across the board, everyone I've seen produces bloated, crappy HTML.  Have you ever saved a Word document as HTML and looked at the output? This, on the other hand, is an easier way of entering hand-crafted HTML, so the output is as good as you are.

    <body>Entering. But what about maintaining, which is the majority of site development effort? Template engines are a much better choice and better practice, than using text editor macros for creating html - it is just too easy to abuse.

WYSWIG is good for end users or when you need to do something quick w/o much knowledge. WYSWIG unfortunately always suck if you want do something correctly, any WYSWIG I saw to date produces crappy output. And once you learn HTML syntax and practice you will be more effective with jEdit than more users with WYSWIG. PS: MS Office a good WYSWIG editor?

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] How to upgrade from 4.3pre16 to 4.3pre17 in Ubuntu?
	(for LilypondTool)</header>
    <body>Hi, I am trying to use LilyPondTool on Ubuntu, and after a long and frustrating installation process involving a number of different plugins I am stuck needing a more recent version of jEdit (4.3pre17) than the most recent one available in Ubuntu Software Center (4.3pre16), because one of the many packages LilyPondTool requires is a version of Sidekick that doesn't work with 4.3pre16. How can I upgrade from 4.3pre16 to 4.3pre17? I don't just want to download 4.3pre17 from Sourceforge or something because Ubuntu will still think it has 4.3pre16. I tried to upgrade through Ubuntu Software Center, but after I added jEdit to the list of software sources, it complained that jEdit was not a trusted source.  I need an authentication key file in order to add it. Any suggestions? thanks, Heather</body>

[quote From the Launcher plugin description] The Launcher plugin provides a way to add the same context specific menu to the File System Browser, ProjectViewer, Plugin Menu, and text area contextual menu. The contents of this menu is dynamic and depends on the current selection or buffer. This menu offers various ways of launching the selected resource(s). For example: Launchers are organized by LauncherTypes, which manage launchers that: Note that the same Launcher can be used by many LauncherTypes. For example on most systems one can find a command line tool that is able to open a file with its associated application and also open a url with the default browser (desktop settings). On x11 system this application is 'xdg-open', on Mac OS X 'open', and on Windows 'start'. At startup the Launcher plugin determines which OS is being used and defines the corresponding SystemApplicationOrBrowserLauncher. The latter will then be used by BrowserLauncherType and SystemApplicationLauncherType. More precisely the Launcher plugin proposes a framework for defining Launchers and managing them via LauncherTypes. Both of these classes are services whereby other plugins can contribute new Launchers and LauncherTypes. Launchers are an extension of the EditAction type. They are typically stateless therefore the same instance is reused in different places. [/quote] -- Learn from the past. Live in the present. Plan for the future. 11101000</body>

Please try running the Java installer, and jEdit if the installer succeeded, and report the result.  e-letter wrote: (snip) Since you reported the problem on starting jEdit 4.3, I assume you could run jedit4.3install.jar, right?

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] start failure with IBM JRE</header>
    <body>Perhaps a middle ground: IBM JRE has known issues which may be found at xxx. The Sun JRE is the reference implementation, it is also the most commonly used JRE. If I were the author of jedit (I wish!) I would have said upfront in the very early days that the only supported JRE is Sun. As a developer I've had compatibility issues even with Sun, taking the time to try to support all the engines is just not practical. It is noble enough to open source a complex, quality product like jedit, it is over the top to expect these same people to support a plethora of JREs. Tracking down JRE compatibility issues can take a lot of time that is basically unproductive. Fixing them can often break the reference (Sun) implementation. Remember PC-DOS? It was 90% compatible with MS-DOS. IBM is famous for tricks like this. The open source community should not be pandering to the special quirks of commercial offerings. If company xyz is ambitious enough to publish a JRE/SDK, at the very least they should run all the tests that Sun runs and certify it as being compliant to the published standards. That would spare users the problems when someone tries to take something written to the standard and run it on one of these odd birds.

    <body>Programmers who cannot tolerate users for posting bugs should refuse to use software in the public domain. Why not fork jedit into a 'programmers only' sub-standard version, distribute privately amongst yourselves. Don't test, don't document and under no circumstances allow those stupid non-programmer end-users any access to the 'programmers only' version. Better still, distribute the 'programmers only' version with a single brand computer, to guarantee excellent performance and perfect quality code, where bugs will never, never occur. to find the point where the exception started to happen.  To remind, versions 43pre11 and 43pre16 have been tested (see previous comments). I have not seen any public versions between these. If you want versions 12-15 to be tested, they should be made available to the public. I have returned to using 43pre11 which works. 43pre16 and later versions tested, all failed.

    <body>Hi, I don't think anyone refuses to support other Java implementations (otherwise, no one would have replied your requests). The thing is, most developers have only Sun Java installed and will not install additional Java versions to ensure it works with them  (for various reasons). While we want to help users, our resources are limited. If anyone is willing to cooperate in testing jEdit for IBM Java (or OpenJDK), they are most welcome. We'd like jEdit to be supported as widely as possible, but we need help from the jEdit community for that. If jEdit is valuable for you, and you have to use IBM Java for whatever reason, you're more than welcome to help with testing and reporting problems, with enough data that would enable us to fix the problems without installing IBM Java on our machines.

    <body>You can do the following: 1. Check the activity log file for exceptions. 2. Try to run jEdit with "-noplugins". See if that problem still happens. If it doesn't happen, start removing plugins one by one until you find the one responsible. Submit a bug report against the core or the responsible plugin.

    <body>Alan, Fortunately the global options menu is visible, so I was able to change it. Good news: jedit now works. However, it has an interesting side effect: if other X applications (nedit or xclock or both) are running, when jedit starts it "steals" the window manager from the other applications! jedit works normally, but the other windows cannot be moved or resized or cycled through. After quitting jedit the other X applications get their window back. Fortunately I normally only run an editor as an X application, so this is not really a big deal. I am still on RedHat 9, so it is possible that strangeness in that version of XFree86 is the root cause. I am planning to upgrade to CentOS 5 very soon.

Now I did manage to compile the SVN but it still gives me the error. There are 2 possibilities now, either my compiling isn't any good or the bug isn't fixed yet.

    <body>Dear jEdit users, After we got the new stable release of 4.3 (and 4.3.1), we (core developers) became not sure what development task should we prioritize as a team. So we want to know what users want. The question is: If the priorities became clear, we can work more efficiently as a team to achieve the goal. Please send your answer to &amp;lt;jedit-users@...&amp;gt;. Just sending a reply will do that. If you find an answer from another user which you can agree, please send your "+1" to prioritize it more. Followings are some information about the question. There are many development tasks. For example, implementing new features, fixing bugs, planning the next release, cleaning the codes, updating docs, reviewing patches, etc. These are lists of open tracker items. We are happy if you provide the item ID related to your answer. This is a link to the most up to date list of things have been done after the release of 4.3.

    <body>I have two votes: 1. I notice that jEdit is very slow when working with large files. Examples are XSL files of 500KB or javascript files of 900KB, both of which I have to work with routinely at my job. 2. I'd like a simple way to search 2-3 folders at once - preferably by listing them all in the Directory box, delimited by some character. I find it cumbersome to go through the multi-step process of downloading a plugin and setting up a whole "project" just to search an additional folder. =)</body>

    <body>wrote: If I may butt in here--I do a lot of editing of middling to large XML files (10k lines, some much longer).  The indentation is not consistent: some of the files are produced by another application, which cares nothing about human-readable files.  (While I could run a beautifier over the files, we keep them in a version control system, and doing beautification would result in a massive number of changes, most of them irrelevant.)  So if I want to use folding based on the XML structure, I have to do it with SideKick's XML parser.  I've turned off the "Auto parsing Settings" in SideKick for all except "Parse on buffer save", as things bog down too much otherwise. I don't know that there's a solution to this; parsing &amp;gt; 10k lines of XML (or any other programming language) is probably going to take awhile regardless of optimization (although I would love to be proved wrong!). But I mention this in case it's a reason why jEdit appears slow to some people; if it is, changing the SideKick AutoParse settings may make life easier.</body>

    <body>There is a work-around.  I've been busy (I started a new job, spring planting, etc) so I haven't been able to follow up on this yet.  Although, I hit your bug at my new job by installing jEdit from regular downloads rather than compiling from svn.  The work-around: 1. start jEdit 2. go to Plugins - Plugin Manager 3. Uncheck the SVN Plugin 4. Close Plugin Manager 5. Click on ProjectViewer to make it visible. 6. Go back to Plugin Manger, check the SVN Plugin. 7. Close Plugin Manager. Now ProjectViewer should have Subversion in the context menu.  If you get an error in PV, close jEdit and restart and do steps 6 and 7. Dale</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ]  vote for fixes - optimizing soft wrap speed</header>
    <body>Hi all, in response to prioritizing the development efforts, I would very much welcome some optimization of the soft wrap function. I am not completely sure, but I believe that it might tie in somewhat with the recently discussed bug 'jEdit unusably slow when editing file with long lines - ID: 2962965'. Besides coding, I also use jEdit to read e-book texts, and with the soft wrap option on it takes quite long time to load a text file. Especially if I keep for instance five or more buffers open, jEdit start can take over a minute or two to load them up when restoring previously opened files, depending on the file sizes. Even when jEdit is running, clicking on a different tab and activating the buffer sometimes takes more than ten seconds if the file is over 1-2 Mb. For illustration I have tried opening a 3 Mb large text file named 'Text 3Mb 1.txt' without word wrap - it took 3 seconds (Activity log 14:06:49-14:06:52), and then I have opened the same file under a different name 'Text 3Mb 2.txt' with soft wrap on, and it took 17 seconds (Activity log 14:07:24-14:07:41) to load.

    <body>Currently, for a "whole word" search, you need to open the Search dialog, mark the "Regular expressions" check-box, and enter "\bword\b" without the double-quotes (e.g. in your example \babc\b) in the "Search for:" box. You can also create a macro to do that. You can start by recording the above in a macro, then modify it a bit to search for the selected word.

There are several ways to end the jEdit server. - Close jEdit not with the red X in the upper right, but use File-&amp;gt;Exit, that will exit jEdit completely - Use the Startmenu entry "Stop jEdit server" if you installed the Startmenu shortcuts - Type "jedit -quit" at the command line All three individually should close jEdit completely. Btw. in the processes list it is one of your "java.exe" processes. I don't know the task menager in Vista, but if it cannot show the command line a process was started with, you could use a more decent process manager like "Process Explorer" from Sysinternals ( good software, as the just bought it and distribute it themselves now.

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Creating a customised jEdit OSX build.</header>
    <body>Hi Dennis, there are many ways to do that or something similar. Here some options: - open the jEdit.app folder with "Show content" from the context menu and copy the settings and plugins that you want to have "pre-packaged" there, then send around the jEdit.app or build a (internet enabled) DMG for it - use the plugin manager to install the plugins you want to have "pre-packaged" not to the settings but to the jEdit directory, then they should land automatically in the jEdit.app, then open the jEdit.app folder with "Show content" from the context menu and copy the settings that you want to have "pre-packaged" there, then send around the jEdit.app or build a (internet enabled) DMG for it - export your plugin set via plugin manager as plugin set and distribute that exported file and your settings file. With the plugin set your friends can install that same set of plugins automatically by importing the plugin set from within plugin manager and the settings file has just to be placed inside the settings directory - distribute your whole settings folder to your friends (take care about what you distribute, some plugins store cache data there that only would need space, some plugins store passwords there) - download or checkout the source and modify the build process so that the settings and plugins you want are included, then call "ant dist-mac" There are possibly a dozen other ways to do what you want to do, it is a matter of taste how you want to do it. The simplest and easiest way is maybe to export your plugin set and give them your settings file.

    <body>Thinking about this some more I reckon the Favourites functionality could be improved. In the left hand pane where "roots:" is displayed, and the current path tree is displayed.  I would recommend adding icons beneath this main root of a different colour (say yellow), that represent the favourites.  This is much quicker and nicer than having to go to the 'Favorites' menu.  The Favourites could also be give names... so for example I could have a favourite called "www" for the path "c:\wamp\www".  The "www" would be a shorthand name for the favourite and this would appear alongside the yellow icon beneath the "roots:" On 29 April 2010 17:49, maxwell &amp;lt;maxwell@...&amp;gt; wrote:</body>

OS: Windows XP Pro, Service Pack 2 Java: 1.6.0_18 according to the first test at  jEdit: 4.1.3 Sidekick 0.9 XML 2.6.1 XSLT 0.6.0 Just for fun, I tried renaming the xml I've been using file to append ".txt", and opened it in jEdit, and had no problems. jEdit did seem to be pegged at 50% CPU the whole time, but I did not experience any delays or freezes - it was very responsive. The file is 1.38 MB, nearly 44000 lines, but I can't send it to you for testing due to concerns about proprietary information. If you have a similarly large file you'd like me to try out, I would be happy to. Hope this helps. Thanks again for your interest.

You might want to try the 4.3.2 daily as it's more stable than the other one:  It looks like the latest XML plugin available through PM is the same as the latest XML Plugin daily - so you should be good to go there.

    <body>I happened to install jEdit on a VM and edit a file that is usually pretty slow over there, and it wasn't slow at all. So I sat down and compared the two installs, and I've discovered that it's something in .jedit/properties that is causing the slowness. When I remove that file from my profile and restart jEdit, everything's fine. I'll start digging through that file, trying to find the line that is my problem, and let everyone know what I find. This does explain why nobody else could replicate the problem I was having, and why a fresh install of jEdit to a different directory in Program Files showed the same problem.</body>

    <body>On Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:55:20 -0500, Sarah Cranston pretty Is this an XML file? FWIW, I tried to edit a 700,000 line XML file (it's a dictionary) in jEdit 4.3.1 the other day.  It loaded fine, but when I tried to jump to the end of the file, jEdit froze, and still appeared to be frozen two hours later. I killed jEdit, and re-started it.  But before I went anywhere in that file, I turned off all the "Auto parsing settings" in the SideKick plugin. Now I can jump to the end of the file the first time in five seconds or so, and after that virtually instantaneously. Every line in this file is an open or close tag, or a complete element, so there must be several 100k elements in the file.  I'm not surprised SideKick takes awhile to digest it.  I do notice, however, that even with SideKick's auto parsing turned off, I can still put the cursor on the beginning or end tag of the root XML element, and jump to its mate with "go to matching tag or bracket", in under a second.  So in some sense jEdit still *has* parsed the entire file.  Which makes me wonder what it is that SideKick is doing besides parsing the XML.</body>

    <body>That sounds about consistent with my results. I found the line in properties that was causing the problem ... it was the one that sets folding mode to "sidekick." When I set folding mode to Sidekick in the 2nd install, the one that was working fine, the problem comes back up again. And like Maxwell says, jumping to the end of the file is a bad idea. :-) Mike, exactly what settings are you changing? I tried setting the parsing dropdown to "none" at the top of the dockable Sidekick window, but this didn't fix the problem. I should try the settings you're trying.

    <body>Yes, the release date is part of the plugin list that is downloaded from the server. Even the date of the files inside the JAR is no good option as long as it is not guaranteed that it is the same as the release date and this is NOT guaranteed. Also, to be honest, I don't really like the idea of adding it to the properties, as you then have to make sure that this property setting is in sync with the server setting. One idea maybe would be to save the date that comes from the server in a property on installation, but even this is not accurate in case someone installs a custom built JAR the previous release date would be shown which also is not correct. I don't think there is a good way to do this cleanly. And to be honest, I also don't see a need for this. I - as a user - am not interested in the release date once I installed a plugin. When deciding whether to install a plugin or not, the date matters to see how long the last release is past. But once I installed the plugin I decided it was recent enough. If I still need to know the date, I can still go to the website and look there when the release date was. So I'm sorry, but I don't think this should be implemented.

    <body>It's the Sidekick settings -- Plugins - Plugin Options - Sidekick that govern code completion in general Check the auto parse and code completion settings, code completion only works well when 'parse on keystroke' is selected, but this is also the source of performance issues with large files. You also need the XML plugin for code completion to work for xml and html files.  If you have the XML plugin disabled, you won't get code completion for these files. The XML plugin configuration (Plugins - Plugin options - XML - XML) has settings on when to insert closing tags. Dale On Wed, Apr 7, 2010 at 9:27 AM, maxwell &amp;lt;maxwell@...&amp;gt; wrote:</body>

(jedit 4.3 on Ubuntu 9.10).  Also the algorithm described is too simplistic. If the auto indent worked I could test it further.  For example I type %html %head = stylesheet_link_tag 'scaffold' and it should indent each line one more than the one above, but does not.  If I mark it and hit control-I then it does. There is no way it can ever be perfect as there is no way that the editor can know whether the next line (%body) should be back at the same level as %head or on the same level as the line above, as far as I can see anyway.

    <body>Ok, so you want to use only your custom abbrevs and with automatic replacement switched on. Of course this makes sense, I just wanted to know your motivation out of interest while I had a look in the code. :-) All the abbrevs, your custom ones and the default ones (read: the current set of abbrevs) is stored in the file "abbrevs" in your settings directoy (by default ~/.jedit). If this file exists, all abbrevs (and only those) contained in that file are loaded. If it doesn't exists, the default abbrevs are loaded and stored in that file. So just go to "Utilities -&amp;gt; Settings Directory -&amp;gt; abbrevs" and remove the lines you don't want to have. Then save that file and restart jEdit. The other way is to remove them one after each other through the GUI. Btw. about the percentage display. This can not be activated currently.

Then you can press that key-combo and after that the one char shortcut to set or goto the according marker. If you really want to set the 'a' shortcut marker automatically, you can also do that. Just create two macros, one with content [quote] [/quote] and one with content [quote] [/quote] Then you can assign those macros to the key combos you want to use.

    <body>Hey guys, I have some questions/suggestions regarding the CtagsInterface plugin. I am running the latest jEdit SVN version and the latest CtagsInterface from the daily builds. Thanks for the help. Regards, -- Roland Dalmulder</body>
  </mail>
  <mail>
    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Ctagsinterface searching</header>
    <body>Hi, For some reason, gmail removed the bullets from the original email when I clicked "reply". Please note that I am currently changing CtagsInterface to use Lucene (full text search engine) instead of a relational database for storing the tag database. There are several reasons for this change - it improves performance greatly, and provides a lot of flexibility in tag lookup (e.g. you can use fuzzy searches, where you don't remember the precise name of a tag). The is a very large change and affects most of the answers. 1. This is possible with the trunk version, but not with the released version. CtagsInterface has 'dynamic actions' that allow you to write queries that will result in tags to jump to. A few weeks ago, someone contributed a patch that allows you to use these queries also for the "Search for a tag with prefix" popup. When you enter the query, you can select whether you want to jump to the tag that is produced as a result of the query, or open this popup with the results. Using this feature, you can write a query that will find all functions, and have the popup let you choose only between functions. However, this is not a good solution, as most likely you'll have numerous functions to select from. Once I'm done porting CtagsInterface to Lucene, this will be much simpler, as Lucene queries are much more flexible. I'll be able to enhance this popup to support Lucene queries. 2. Case-insensitive search will be enabled when the port to Lucene is completed. 3. "Search for substring" is also case-sensitive. It should work fine, but it can take a lot of time, as the plugin creates a data structure in-memory to support this (this is one of the reasons why I am switching to Lucene). "Search with prefix" has no wildcards support as of now. 4. I am not sure about the Tags plugin. CtagsInterface also has an option to "import" an existing tag file, however I think that Tags supports tag files on VFS (e.g. ftp), while CtagsInterface currently only supports tag files on locally-mounted file-systems. If your tag files are local, no need to use Tags. If your sources are in locally-mounted file-systems only, there is also no need to use tag files, as CtagsInterface will run Ctags for you and keep the tag information up-to-date automatically. 5. To use the completion, type the prefix of a function name and select this action. It should show a small completion popup. Note that this is also case sensitive. In general, note that if you can type the entire function name and jump to it using the plugin, then typing a prefix of the function name and selecting this action should include the entire name in the completion options. For functions, this should also complete the signature (i.e. show you templates for the parameters, using the SuperAbbrevs plugin). The downside of the switch to Lucene is, that you'll have to delete your existing tag database and recreate it from scratch using Lucene. The advantages with Lucene are huge, so it's worth it ...

    <body>Hello, Thank you for your elaborate answer. I can see how the Lucene index will be a great improvement, I have no problem with recreating my indexes. 1. Let's wait for the Lucene implementation to be finished 2. Ok 3. Let's see how it is later with Lucene. After 3 minutes nothing has happened nor seemed it did anything. The machine is powerful enough, 8-core with 8GB memory. 4. Oh my ctags are all local, so I dropped Tags 5. I still can't get this to work, maybe it is part of problem 6 6. In the Help I read I can add Dependencies in the properties of a project. Now it doesn't work for me and I have 2 scenarios: - When I add a file path as a dependency, it doesn't jump to a tag in the dependency tree and tells me no tag has been found - When I add another project as dependency, it gets real busy and stays busy but nothing ever happens until I kill the application. Using the tag jump in the project listed as dependency it works fine sometimes. Can I verify some way or another what CtagsInterface "sees"? I have Tag Search Scope set to Active project and its dependencies So in general it seems to lock up randomly now. Is this a case of dropping all indexes and recreate them?

    <body>Regarding your last question, I don't know. If you want to see what's in your database, you can close jEdit (to release the database lock) and use some other database client to check what the database contains. This, of course, depends on the database you use. hsqldb has a "database manager", which is a class in the hsqldb.jar file, that you can run directly. h2 has a web-based interface which it really good. Please consult the web page of your specific database for information. I may be able to help too if it's one of those I know. Shlomy On Sat, May 29, 2010 at 11:07 PM, RolandD Cyber Produksi</body>

    <body>I think it would be better if the 'errors' (in red text in the status bar of jEdit) were disabled by default. It makes the editor look buggy when in fact most errors here are expected errors (e.g. I just got an error as the auto-save tried to save an untitled folder in a system directory and quite rightly my default user account didn't have permissions). To a developer this error info is great but to a regular user it looks bad. How about disabling this by default?  Have it as a setting in preferences instead. I think it's good to give the right impression for a product... perception is everything.</body>

    <body>I hate those error messages! damn them all. Why do we have to have any errors in this program?? :-) The idea is, if you found a condition under which you can reproduce the error, then you might actually file a bug report, tell us the steps you took to reproduce it, and that would  help us fix  the error so it doesn't show up anymore. On the other hand, if you do expect some sort of message to report when you do something wrong, you could suggest that we pop up as a dialog with a message that says "DON'T DO THAT YOU DUMMY!". But in any case, the stack trace and activity log are key to helping us understand what you did. alan, who should be asleep but is too jetlagged to know any better...</body>

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Errors showing in status bar</header>
    <body>I totally understand the error requirements in regards to error reporting, but surely better to mimic what Windows or OSX does? There should be two types of error: 1) Expected error: This should ALWAYS be dealt with in a user-friendly way... i.e. if the auto-save feature tries to save my untitled document in a unix folder where I don't have permissions then a dialog (as you said) should say "Can't autosave 'untitled 1' to /usr/bin.  Click here to turn off autosave for untitled files, OR you might think about running jEdit as root if you need to save a file in that locaiton".  That's just an example error message but it's far more constructive, as it: a) Tells the user exactly what has happened in clear terms. b) It tells them possible options to improve the situation without needing to Google or go online! 2) Unexpected error (but catchable in some way): Tell the user an unexpected error has occurred (in a dialog if possible) and ask them if they want to automatically report the error (as XP and OSX do).  Then it automatically downloads all the relevant error logs without a user needing to find them. This is MUCH better.  The easier it is for users to report errors, the better for everyone, it really is a win-win situation. 3) Unexpected error (but non-catchable, i.e. total crash) however jEdit might be able to do a "Firefox" and know that it crashed next time it starts up, if so then do the same as 2) 4) Unexpected error (totally non-catchable, system doesn't know it crashed): This would rely on the user posting the error logs.  I would recommend adding a really simple (Send Error Report) item on one of the menus (if it doesn't already exist).  This automatically adds the error logs, and asks the user what actually happened. I think having to register for the PRIVILEGE of reporting errors is lame.  I have about eight thousand different accounts with eight thousand different passwords just for reporting bugs on software... this is NOT cool.  This needs to change in the freeware industry.  As I said the easier it is to report bugs the better.  The same level of detail can be captured now but please please PLEASE make it so that we change this culture so that error reporting happens as part of the application.  The application should KNOW all the relevant information, i.e. platform etc etc... still ask the user what happened but logging in to bugzilla... oh please that's so last decade!  It's a win-win to get this sorted, and I mean for ALL software... please spread the word.  Forget web 2.0, we now needs Freeware 2.0 where this sort of thing is automatic. The only thing about bugzilla is that it really bugs me ;)  I don't always have time to report bugs for ALL applications, so I only report about a third of bugs... I reckon some users don't even bother signing up to things like bugzilla... I reckon only 10% of people report bugs... but if we make it easy then 30% probably will.  That's a three-fold increase!

    <body>Hi, What you describe below is the right way to handle errors from the user's point of view, but there are a few points here that need to be taken into account: 1. This approach is more appropriate for commercially-supported applications. You mention eight thousand user accounts - what about the eight thousand developers to actually take a look at all these errors? 2. The access to SF is not simple. Filing a bug report automatically in SF probably has its share of additional problems. I'd be glad if we had some global database to which we could send information from jEdit in a simple way. I am looking for such a database not only for error reporting, but also for collecting statistical usage information. 3. Do you know which data should be collected? Mostly, we ask for the activity log file and the properties, sometimes also for buffer content. But these can contain some sensitive information, and is not always appropriate. If you have good solutions for the above, let me know... I'll be glad to help. Shlomy 2010/5/18 Mike &amp;lt;xandrani@...&amp;gt;:</body>

    <body>99 times out of 100 [*], what I end up with are file not found exceptions when starting jEdit -- because I've deleted or renamed files outside jEdit.  In that situation, they're particularly annoying because I can't find the name of the file in the stack trace -- and all I'm really interested in is closing those buffers, so I don't hear about it next time I restart jEdit (talk about reproducable ;-)).  I generally keep between 200 and 400 buffers open, so going through one-by-one isn't particularly fun.  When confronted by a modal dialog with a list of files, I wish I could copy the buffer names or close them right there there, but since I don't restart jEdit more often than once week, it's an intermittent annoyance -- never enough that I've done anything about it. Anyway, with being able to tail and search in the activity log, I really don't see how these provide much value --  I do see the annoyance, though; and I'd agree with Mike that they don't look good. -Ollie * The other 1 is probably a permission denied, a network timeout, etc....

If they haven't, the error is by definition * unexpected* - so it will propagate, and become a system error. If a condition that *should *be being handled by a friendly message is instead creating a system error, that is a bug, and should be reported. If a system error is occurring that *cannot* be replaced with a friendly message - well, that's a bug too, surely? In other words, fatal errors should always be reported as bugs if you can reproduce them. If the resolution to the bug is to show the user a friendly message - or even ignore the error and recover automatically - that is still a worthwhile bug report. Now, whether we should expect all "ordinary" users to see and deal with the fatal errors, I'm less sure. As Shlomy says, automatically filing error reports is not trivial, and sifting through them to find actual bugs even less so. I agree with you about making it easier to report bugs in Free Software ("Freeware" means something different, BTW), though, with caveats again about sifting effort.

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] middle-click a fold</header>
    <body>Hm, we don't differentiate between left and middle mouse button currently. And Java sets the "Alt" modifier if the middle mouse button is pressed. So for jEdit pressing the middle mouse button is equal to holding "Alt" and pressing the left mouse button. The behaviour of that combination is not controllable through the settings dialog, but it is controlled via the property "view.gutter.AfoldClick" which you can set to any action you like. By default it is set to "narrow-fold". You may want to set it to "expand-fold". Regards Vampire James schrieb:</body>

    <body>I generally run the latest jEdit from either svn or the daily builds, so maybe that is the cause of my problem, but I thought I'd ask if anyone else has seen this issue before I write up a bug. I'm using the original docking framework. I have jEdit set up so that my plugins are docked either at the bottom or on the right side.  (Screenshot:  the buffer switcher to change to another file, the active plugins with change.  For example, if Project Viewer is active on the right and Console is active on the bottom, I'll change files and suddenly the File Brower is active on the right and the Activity Log will be active on the bottom.  Then I change to another file, and Project Viewer and Console are active again. This is not consistent behavior in that it doesn't always happen, but it happens a lot for me.

This feature is meant to provide something similar to "perspective" in eclipse, where you have a different layout for each type of development task (e.g. one for java, one for perl, ...).

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Can modes delegate recursively?</header>
    <body>I have a set of custom modes that delegate recursively.  Stripped to its essentials, the pattern is: mode A delegates to mode B, and mode B delegates to mode A.  This worked under 4.2 final, but under 4.3.1, jEdit stops repainting and eventually produces a message about "invalid delegates"; it has to be killed with Task Manager. Is is legal to do this under 4.3.1?  Was its working under 4.2 just a fluke? TIA, George Hovey</body>

CtagsSideKick is just an interface for Ctags, it cannot get this information by itself. So it doesn't know that 'pri' is a member of A.

If the dot files are imported, then you know it's something in your import filter. - Update to the latest development version of ProjectViewer (in case it contains some fixes that may be relevant).

	jEdit 4.3.1/Win 7</header>
    <body>Thanks to our jEdit experts for their quick and useful responses. All recognized that the mode file must contain an invalid character, at least if it is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding.  This is so because I am intentionally using characters in the range 0x80-0xFF of ISO-8859-1 and these presumably represent impossible values in UTF-8. However, the mode worked under jEdit 4.2 Final so encoding seemed to be the root cause. I took Vampire's advice and included `encoding="ISO-8859-1"` in the heading after which jEdit was immediately willing to read my mode files.  [It doesn't like them for others reasons which I'm working my way through  -- so far jEdit Help has provided the explanations.] Thanks Kazutoshi for clearing up the mystery of why my modes suddenly failed (4.3.1 is a better jEdit!). BTW, the sum total of my knowledge of XML comes from jEdit's Help file, and I may not be the only one in that boat.  The section "The Preamble and MODE tag" makes no mention of the default encoding issue and what to do about it.  It would be nice if Vampires's crystal clear explanation could make its way into the Help file.  Kazutoshi's note would be useful too in case I'm not the the last in the world to be using 4.2 Final.

The XP system is running jEdit 4.2 Final and the laptop jEdit 4.3.1. I believe both systems to be using ISO-8859-1 coding: this is my intent, and both old and new jEdits say so under 'encoding' and in the status bar. I haven't been able to get my custom modes to work under 4.3.1.  At first I couldn't get even the bare CATALOG to be accepted (it produced the error "Invalid byte 1 of 1-byte UTF-8 sequence").  After considerable fiddling, recopying the mode files, etc, CATALOG was accepted, but my mode was not.

    <body>It's a parse error due to an invalid character in that mode file. There is no way to further diagnose this issue unless you post the actual mode file also. Try attaching that to a reply. Or try opening it in jEdit using ISO-8851 encoding and saving it. jEdit should tell you exactly where the error is then.

    <body>Hi George, the mode files are XML files. If you don't specify an encoding in the XML file, XML files default to be UTF-8 encoded. If you save the mode file with ISO-8895-1, without specifying so in the XML file, while having some special characters in it that result in illegal UTF-8 sequences, this can happen. Actually I wonder that the same files work with 4.2final but not with 4.3.1. But maybe something got changed (read: fixed) here to behave correctly. Maybe you should try to either convert your mode files to UTF-8 or declare them to be ISO-8859-1 explicitly. If even this wont work, an example file that can be investigated would be helpful.

    <body>Hi Matthieu, As i remember, we`ve discussed this few months ago, and the main problems was: 1. No Java6 support on 32bit MacOSX (2-3 years old MacBooks) 2. No crucial API was added to Java6. What about keep java5 support for 4.3 branch and use java6 support only for 4.4+ ? -- Voituk Vadim vadim.voituk@...

    <body>Hi, I remember but we didn't had a decision. 2-3 MacBooks are MacIntel and should be able to run a 64bits OS I think, and there are really useful api probably not crucial but useful like SwingWorkers. Of course if we drop java 5 support it would be only for the 4.4.x release, the 4.3.x would remains in java 5 Matthieu 2010/5/5 Vadim Voituk &amp;lt;vadim.voituk@...&amp;gt;:</body>

    <body>Hi all, I proudly present 4.3.2 which came out now. Have fun with the new release. JEDIT 4.3 VERSION HISTORY Thanks to Björn "Vampire" Kautler, Matthieu Casanova, Shlomy Reinstein, Kazutoshi Satoda, oman002, and Eric Le Lay for contributing to this release. - Fixed Standalone TextArea build target (Shlomy Reinstein) - Fixed a NPE that happens when an error occurs before the view is loaded (Matthieu Casanova #2905487) - Fixed bug #2927555: beanshell load() fails w/ exception (Shlomy Reinstein) - Fixed a memory leak which held closed View and EditPane when using global bufferset scope. (Kazutoshi Satoda) - When removing text from the buffer, the event contentRemoved was sent before making the buffer dirty (oman002 #2944145) - Fixed leaky memory usage after some specific text operations. (Kazutoshi Satoda) - Worked around a memory leak in Sun Java 6 where the sun.font.GlyphLayout is cached and reused while holding an instance to the char array (Björn "Vampire" Kautler) - When setting a new message in the status bar in a macro called from the Macro menu the message was cleared immediately (Matthieu Casanova #2964522) - don't log an error when the API docs are not available. Provide a link to the online docs instead (SF.net bug #1777806 - Eric Le Lay) - RFC edit mode was misplaced in catalog and was never matching anything because text edit mode glob was more global and checked first (Matthieu Casanova) - java installer refuses to install from a directory containing exclamation marks (SF.net bug #2065330 - Eric Le Lay) - Applied patch #2932330 to suppress BufferUpdate messages from temporary buffers to improve performance.

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] p4 plugin question</header>
    <body>I've just started using the p4 plugin for a project at work.  The directory structure looks like this: /home/whatever/workspace/mainproject /home/whatever/workspace/mainproject/project1 /home/whatever/workspace/mainproject/project2 ... I have a p4 config file in  /home/whatever/workspace/mainproject, but in jEdit, I've set up my project (in ProjectViewer) to just work on /home/whatever/workspace/mainproject/project1.  Doing p4 sync from ProjectViewer gives me an error executing perforce: Exit status: 1 Perforce client error: Connect to server failed; check $P4PORT. TCP connect to perforce failed. perforce: host unknown. Is it possible to have the p4 plugin run the p4 commands from the root directory of the project?  If it would, then the commands would succeed without having to add a p4 config file to each subproject since p4 will check parent directories for the config file. Thanks, Dale</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Sorry I forgot to send it to the list</header>
    <body>Well... I looked at the activity.log... and noticed that it was not loading the ftp plugin. So I reinstalled that, thinking that the problem might have been its name on a list somewhere and its not being found. But when I tried file =&amp;gt; open again I noticed a funny little black cursor-looking thing in the vicinity of the file position on the menu... which turned out to be the file open dialog window all shrunk down to nothing! So probably that was my problem all along. Things seem ok again. Two things have been bothering me lately though, now that I have you on the phone, Doctor... 1. Sometimes (often!) jEdit becomes unresponsive to the keyboard. Sometimes using the mouse to cut and paste some random something in the buffer returns the keyboard function but sometimes (often) I have to close the program and reopen it to get the keyboard back. Lately this has been the drill. Closing and reopening jEdit twenty times or more during a session. 2. Sometimes (less often) a selection will become selected and I cannot unselect it. The cursor switches between two unusual icons... I just keep playing with the mouse until finally something happens and it changes back to its usual mode. It is frustrating to lose control of the program, especially in the second instance when I don't know what I did to change the mode of the mouse nor do I know how I change it back again when it "fixes itself". I like jEdit though. I hate having to use Editra or gedit for serious work because I don't know how to work them effectively. You can see that I don't really know how to use jEdit either, but it is so much more powerful just using what I do know that I am lost without it, and feel very put upon when I do lose control of it. It's great though. And my present machine is so powerful that the fact that it's a java app is hardly noticeable. So thanks, in any event, for a great product.

    <body>To me, this is actually one of the weak points of the jEdit project. The community website and wiki are rather dated and buggy. I don't remember what it was, but there was some hurdle that needed to be cleared before any updates to the site could be applied. Since I'm posting this on the users list, I might as well throw out a general question. In order to promote the use of a wiki for how-tos and sharing of files (macros, color schemes, etc.), I've been considering starting up a jEdit wikia page. I attempted to do it once before with the hopes that it would be the official jEdit wiki, but that ended up being a no-go. However, until the site becomes renovated, it might not be a bad idea to re-create the wikia, but as an unofficial site rather than the official one at community.jedit.org.

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] buffer switcher not switching</header>
    <body>A bug has started happening in jEdit in the last week or so which I haven't seen before.  Which is odd, because I don't remember doing anything to change my configuration recently.  ("Remember" is probably the operative word...) Specifically, sometimes the buffer switcher doesn't work any more when I try to use it from the buffer switcher, i.e. by opening the buffer switcher drop-down at the top of the buffer and using 'up' or 'down' to move through the names of buffers.  The name of the buffer changes, but the buffer remains the same.  (I don't know what would happen if I made a change in an incorrectly labeled buffer--I'm afraid to do that for fear I'd lose the file on the server.)  I believe View | Go to Previous/Next Buffer always works, but I use that so seldom that I can't say for sure. Some things which are perhaps non-standard about my setup: 1) I have jEdit partitioned vertically into three panes (I have large monitors :-) 2) I'm using the ftp plugin, and all the files reside on an ftp server 3) I have "Visible rows in buffer switcher" set to 100 (probably overkill) 4) "BufferSet scope for new EditPanes" is set to global 5) "Sort buffer sets" and "Sort buffer sets by file name" are both checked. This bug seems to happen sporadically.  I had "View | Toggle buffer switcher" checked; I just now unchecked the box and re-checked it, and the switcher started working again.  It's hard to fix a sporadic bug, I know...so if anyone else has seen this, or has suggestions on how to generate an error report the next time I see it, let me know.

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] buffer switcher not switching</header>
    <body>Hi, Most likely, jEdit is trying to switch the current buffer and fails with an exception. Can you attach the activity log file, or search for exceptions in it? This file is in the jEdit settings directory - you can reach it from jEdit itself using Troubleshooting -&amp;gt; Activity Log". Note that the activity log file is overwritten each time you run jEdit, so send it (or search for exceptions in it yourself) after you experience this problem but before you restart jEdit.

    <body>1) Yes.  It's not a high volume list and never has been.  Most jEdit developers follow this list pretty closely and respond quickly to user issues. 2) Whatever Plugin Manager shows is available is all there is.  Most plugin developers have moved on to use jEdit 4.3 (or even 4.4) and don't maintain 4.2 compatible plugins.  4.3 is actually quite stable, it would be best if you could use it and post bug reports if you have problems.

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Two questions</header>
    <body>Yes, that's exactly what I saw. Basically, I installed a Linux system, which had jEdit 4.2final in the distro. I installed that, then I went and downloaded the plugins, everything was just fine. A few weeks later installed the same system on a different machine and then the 4.2f plugin manager could find only maybe 3 or 4 plugins. So I had to uninstall 4.2 and install 4.3 from the jEdit website. I was quite surprised, because usually what happens is that you get the new version, with all the new plugins and whatnot, but naturally you can still get the old version and of course, the old version's old plugin manager can get all the old plugins. They may not be supported any more and never developed any further, but they are available. The carpet being pulled from under your feet from one day to the other is a rather bad experience, especially when things that used to work properly do not work any more: 4.3 froze on me a couple of times (always when I did an undo by pressing Ctrl-Z), some 4.3 plugin features do not work (you can turn them on and off, but they don't do anything though used to work perfectly with 4.2f), some new features are positively disturbing (and can't be turned off), the whole editing experience is just flakier than it was with 4.2final. I know almost nothing about java, but I'd guess that it is probably not the java engine because 4.2f works perfectly with the same engine (1.6.0_17). As a matter of fact, if someone could tell me what files do I have to copy from one machine to an other to replicate a working 4.2f setup with all the installed plugins, I would highly appreciate it.

  <mail>
    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Two questions</header>
    <body>Hi, To replicate a 4.2f setup with all the installed plugins, usually all that is needed is to install jEdit 4.2f in the new machine, and copy the jEdit settings directory (.jEdit under your user directory) and its sub-directories recursively to your home directory in the new machine. Would you mind sharing your problems with the upgrade to 4.3 with us? To be able to understand why jEdit freezes, it is strongly recommended to run jEdit from a console (e.g. Command Prompt on Windows). Then, when jEdit freezes, you can usually (depending on the Java implementation, I guess) click Ctrl+Break in the console to get a dump of all Java threads on the console. This can help find out what happened. In addition, the activity.log file (in the jEdit settings directory) can reveal exceptions or problems that were logged. If you can collect this data, you can either submit a bug report in the SourceForge tracker of jEdit, or, if you like, send it to me directly, or to jedit-devel (if you're subscribed to it).

If there are specific plugins/versions that were available on the plugin manager for 4.2 and are no longer, and you know what they are, you can let us know them and we can try to expose them via a branch again.

    <body>I have Win7 Pro 64bit and Fractional Font Metrics enabled.  There is no slowdown on my machine.  It could be your video card (Java tries to feed it through DirectX iirc) or possibly version of Java. On Sun, 4 Jul 2010 12:43:26 -0400, George Hovey &amp;lt;ghova0@...&amp;gt; wrote:</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Format of Hypersearch window</header>
    <body>On my system, Hypersearch squeezes runs of spaces to a single space, and eliminates leading whitespace which has the effect of making much of my code virtually illegible.  Does anyone know of a way to turn off this behavior and display lines exactly as they appear in the source? George</body>

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Format of Hypersearch window</header>
    <body>Hi, Hypersearch results show the line's text without any leading/trailing whitespace (tab or space) - but it does not squeeze runs of spaces into a single space (unless I am missing something). There is currently no way to change this, you may open a feature request in SourceForge if you like. Can you specify why you want this feature disabled? Thanks, Shlomy</body>

If I define the class below, I get a parser error from PHP if I try to compile it under PHP 5.2.13: class Foo Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_CLONE, expecting T_STRING in /home/rowanc/tmp/clone.php on line 4 The only other way $object-&amp;gt;clone() would make any sense would be if you'd defined __call() on the class, in which case it is apparently parseable, but it doesn't seem like a great idea. If it's a clone method, call it "__clone()", and use "clone $object" to call it; if it's not, call it something else. (I appreciate that it's not always as simple as that, and that may not be an option...) While it's arguably a bug that the jEdit parser treats this differently to PHP, I wouldn't be surprised to see PHP treating that syntax as invalid in a future version too. -- Rowan Collins Senior Developer | Click with Technology</body>

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] problem with phpparser and clone method</header>
    <body>OK, I thought it might be something like that, in which case I guess it is worth filing a bug for - there's a few cases I've noticed where the PHPParser plugin doesn't handle input quite the same way as PHP. On the other hand, I notice it doesn't stop the parser parsing the rest of the file, so it's easier to ignore than some. Just to clarify, typing the standard PHP5 syntax "$bar = clone $foo;" does not come up with any errors on my setup (jEdit 4.3.1 / PHPParser 1.2.7). Are you saying that this syntax is also showing errors for you? If so, would it be possible to see a sample of the code producing the error?

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] [jEdit-users] problem with phpparser and clone
 method</header>
    <body>Ah, OK, in your second example, it looks like it's the brackets that are throwing it: it's probably misinterpreting "clone($object)" as a function call to the non-existent function clone(), where PHP5 sees it as "clone" [keyword] followed by "($object)" [expression in brackets] - like "echo ($x+1)". "return @clone $object;" shows as fine, and is probably better style for pure PHP5, although you can actually exploit the fact that clone ($object) looks like a function call to write code that runs in both PHP4 and PHP5. So we have 2 cases for a bug report, if anyone has a chance to look into them: // Uncommon, but used in popular IMagick extension; apparently interpretted as keyword, but actually method call // Uncommon, but used for PHP4 compatibility; apparently interpretted as function call, but actually keyword (I don't actually know anything about how this parser operates, but the above would be my guess as to roughly why these cases produce errors) Regards, Rowan sbarex wrote (on 06/08/2010):</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Syntax error highligting</header>
    <body>Hi All, I have just started using jEdit and so far I am loving it - I used to be an emacs/jSwat kinda developer, and I have just found Eclipse too irritating. It seems to me that most of those features I actually liked in Eclipse are available to a reasonable degree in jEdit+plugins. However, I'm not seeing any indication of syntax errors as I type code. So I was wondering if this is just a plugin or setting that I've missed, or whether it's something that just isn't available in jEdit. If it's not something that's available, is it something that anyone else would like to see in jEdit? My thoughts are to harness the syntax highlighter, and flag syntax that doesn't make sense to the highlighter as a warning/error. I am assuming that this could be implemented without trying to shoehorn a complete incremental compiler into jEdit (probably a bad idea), and instead leveraging code and features already there. Any and all comments welcome. Cheers! Nik</body>

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Syntax error highligting</header>
    <body>Hi Nik, There are a few plugins that can help with this.  The PMD plugin shows syntax errors for java and jsp files.  The various SideKick plugins can show syntax errors for their languages.  These will work as you type if you have them set to parse on keystroke.  However, what you're proposing sounds like a more general solution and sounds like a good idea. Dale On Mon, Aug 2, 2010 at 5:09 AM, Nik Trevallyn-Jones &amp;lt;nik777@...:</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] PHPParser and Sidekick methods list: suggestions
	for new features</header>
    <body>I develop very often in php using jedit with PHPParser and I use Sidekick to navigate quickly in the code. I think it would be useful to add a system which would include custom intems  in the list of functions in the Sidekick. You could define a simple syntax to use within comments to be recognized by phpparser and displayed in the list of functions by way of comment (a similar use of #pragma directive in XCode that allows you to add a comment to appear on the list of methods defined in the file in order to group together pieces of code). I saw a similar function can be implemented using ctags instead phpparser to interpret the code. With following ctags invocation options: --PHP-kinds=+cfd-v --totals=yes --tag-relative=yes --regex-PHP=/[[:blank:]]*(#|\/\/|\/*)[[:blank:]]*pragma:(.*)/--\2--/pragma/ the parser recognizes the comments starting with "pragma:" and shows them in the list of methods such as a divider. But I believe thath Phpparser is more effective than ctags to parse php files. Thanks!</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Hiding regions of the buffer</header>
    <body>Hi, I'd like jEdit to be able to filter out regions of the buffer, so that I don't see them in the text area. The main purpose of this is for preprocessor conditionals in C/C++. Patterns like the following are quite popular in C/C++: #ifdef WIN32 .. do something that works on Windows ... #else .. do something that works on other operating systems ... #endif If I work on Windows, it would be very helpful for me to see only the 2nd line above, so that the rest of the text doesn't interfere while reading the buffer (visually). I'd like to be able to select a word (like WIN32) and have jEdit hide all lines that do not exist when this word is not defined for the preprocessor. This is probably a complex feature, and the main problem is that it can easily conflict with the folding mode. But for starters, I'd like to see how this really looks in tools (editors?) that already have such a feature. Does anyone know of such a tool? IDEs that I know (like Visual Studio) typically show all the text, but show the text I want to hide in gray (as an indication that this code doesn't really exist in the current configuration). I'd like to take this one step further and completely hide this text. Other uses of this feature would be similar to the Mylyn plugin in eclipse, which hides text that has never been visited or is rarely visited. Thanks, Shlomy</body>

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] waitForConsole</header>
    <body>Your macro runs in the UI thread. Unless you create a new thread for this purpose in your macro, the jEdit window will hang until "waitForConsole" returns. This might be a deadlock if the console needs to do something in the UI thread. If that is the case, create a Runnable in your macro for this purpose, and use ThreadUtilities.runInBackground(runnable) to run it. Hope this helps. I don't know how it previously worked. Sounds like either your macro used to run it in the background, or "waitForConsole" used to do that in previous versions of Console. Shlomy</body>

A split + unsplit should allow you to continue working without disruption. If you can reproduce the steps you took to get to that point, please post a bug report.

"Parse on buffer switch and save" is recommended for JavaSideKick in general. "Parse on keystroke" is recommended for completion to work well.

    <body>Hi, due to the recent PHPParser 1.3.0 file parse bug I uninstalled the plugin, with the consequence that * the download mirrors only show the 1.2.7 version of the plugin * most of the downloads (of this plugin) don't work (SWITCH amsterdam did work) * but they only deliver 1.2.7 - although " I suspect it was taken down due to the bug. So my questions are: * How in 'sync' are those download mirrors ? is it ok to use them ? * Given that the developer of PHPParser fixed the bugs in 'trunk', how much time does it take to actually get the plugin.

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Plugin Update / Install - PHPParser</header>
    <body>Hi Patrik, On Wed, Sep 8, 2010 at 11:50 PM, Patrik Plihal &amp;lt;patrik.plihal@...: Correct. The plugin release was reverted back to 1.2.7 until the developer gets some confirmations regarding his fix. Technically, the broken 1.3.0 files should still be available if you go download them manually. Plugin Manager has been set to download the 1.2.7 version, so all the mirrors should have the same old 1.2.7 files still there. I did not "re-release" 1.2.7. So, they should be perfectly fine to use. It's mostly a manual process. Once the plugin developer creates a ticket under the Plugin Release tracker, I manually run some automated scripts to: download, compile, package, and install the plugin for testing. If all looks good, I put the artifacts on sf.net for distribution on the mirrors. Note that "real" testing is mostly left to the developer, and users who are building from source (trunk). I mostly just check to make sure that it all compiles fine, installs without any errors, has a help file, and that menu's and options don't generate any errors. I don't do any "real" testing of the plugins, so occasionally errors happen. There are some daily builds available if you'd like a package that you can unzip in your [jedit settings]/jars directory. These are compiled and prepared using the aforementioned automated scripts, whenever code is checked into the trunk, and are available here:  The PHPParser specifically, available here:  Hope that helps.

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Xdebug support</header>
    <body>Hello all, Now with the renewed PHPParser plugin (thank you all for the work :) ), I want to dig up an old post ( xdebug support in jEdit. This post is from 2008 but no answer nor can I find any other mentioning of this. I did find the Gdbplugin.jar but it doesn't seem to support xdebug. My question is, would it be possible to add support for xdebug? The other day someone was trying hard to convince me to switch to NetBeans PHP, although it has some very nice features which are lacking in jEdit or not complete because jEdit just isn't  a full fledged PHP IDE I did find that jEdit has the upperhand over NetBeans. Not only its footprint is 1/3 of NetBeans but the range of other features it offers is amazing. Kudos to the team. -- Roland Dalmulder</body>

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] ubuntu 10.10 and java version problem</header>
    <body>HI I seem to have got my jedit install messed up.  Using ubuntu 10.10 pre-release I had to install sun java from a ppa as it was not yet available in the standard repository.  This was no problem and I had jedit (4.3.2) running fine from the Ubuntu repository.  Sun Java is now available in the standard repository so I reverted to this from the ppa (using ppa-purge).  jedit will now no longer run.  When I start it from the command line I get exec: 16: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.21/jre/bin/java: not found When I look in /usr/lib/jvm I see java-6-sun-1.6.0.22 and when I do java -version I get Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04) I am guessing that the ppa was the previous version and that jedit for some reason is looking for the old version still.  I tried re-installing jedit (without purge) but it did not help.  I would rather not purge if possible as I presume I would then have to setup all my plugins, key maps etc again. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Colin</body>

    <body>If the path of the JDK is hardcoded in the generated script that means that whenever the user upgrades to a newer version of Java, the script is broken. I think that should be reported as a bug against the jedit installer. Why not have the installer generate a script that uses java from the system path? Then it won't break under situations like this. Personally, I always use my own script to start jEdit which also has no hardcoded paths for java. 2010/10/21 Alex Boisvert &amp;lt;alex.boisvert@...&amp;gt;:</body>

    <body>2010/10/21 Eric Berry &amp;lt;elberry@...&amp;gt;: Thanks to all for the suggestions, I have worked out what is happening, and it is a bit odd. When I look on a machine running Ubuntu 10.04, which works fine, then 'which jedit' yields /usr/bin/jedit and this contains: #!/bin/sh # # Runs jEdit - Programmer's Text Editor. # # Set jvm heap initial and maximum sizes (in megabytes). JAVA_HEAP_MAX_SIZE=192 # Find a java installation. if [ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ]; then echo "Warning: \$JAVA_HOME environment variable not set! Consider setting it." echo "          Attempting to locate java..." j=`which java 2&amp;gt;/dev/null` if [ -z "$j" ]; then echo "Failed to locate the java virtual machine! Bailing..." exit 1 else echo "Found a virtual machine at: $j..." JAVA="$j" fi else JAVA="$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" fi # Launch application. which looks entirely reasonable, and works fine (JAVA_HOME is not set but the logic using which java to find it works). When I look on my 10.10 machine 'which jedit' yields ~/bin/jedit and this contains #!/bin/sh # # Runs jEdit - Programmer's Text Editor. # # Set jvm heap initial and maximum sizes (in megabytes). JAVA_HEAP_MAX_SIZE=192 DEFAULT_JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.21/jre" if [ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ]; then JAVA_HOME="$DEFAULT_JAVA_HOME" fi # Launch application. "/usr/share/jEdit/jedit.jar" "$@" which has the path hard coded so does not work.  If I move this file out of the way then which java yields /usr/bin/jedit which is not the same as the one in 10.4 but contains #!/bin/sh # # . /usr/lib/java-wrappers/java-wrappers.sh find_java_runtime java6 find_jars /usr/share/jedit/jedit.jar run_java org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit "$@" which also works. The ~/bin/jedit script is dated around the date I installed jedit but I have purged jedit and re-installed and cannot persuade it to create this file again.  Where it came from I do not know, I certainly did not type it in.  Having removed it jedit works fine but I do not like mysteries.  There does appear to be a bug somewhere in whatever it was that put the file there, but unless I can persuade something to re-create the file I do not know where to file a bug. Any ideas anyone?

    <body>That is odd. I wonder if that file is from an older version of jEdit? Did you upgrade to 10.10? I tried a fresh install in VirtualBox with the latest jEdit debian installer. I have the same /usr/bin/jedit file you had on your 10.04. I also have the one under ~/bin though, which I definitely didn't have before. Anyone know if the installer got changed recently?

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Find/replace dialog - string history</header>
    <body>Hi I have noticed the recent discussion of jEdit's find and replace dialog. I would like to suggest that it would be helpful if the dialog provided a drop-down list of recent search strings.  I think such functionality is typical of editors, for example Visual C++ Express 2008. Perhaps this is already supported and I am missing something. Would anyone like to comment? Best regards David</body>

    <body>It's there, but you have to click the right mouse button to get it. I think there's also a key that can show the drop down, see here:  The text to search is a "history text field". Shlomy</body>

    <body>Maybe the doc needs correction but I'm not sure. Which operating system are you using? Also, there's a tooltip when you put the mouse pointer over the text box, that tells you how to get the history.

    <body>Hi, I'm still not sure I understand. Do you want CtagsSideKick to show you only the errors in the tree? If that's your intention, you first need to configure Ctags to output the errors. I can't help here, because I don't know how to create a regular expression that will catch only the errors. Is there a name to the format below? Maybe searching the web for "ctags" with this format name will give you some results. If the above is not what you want, then you should use Hypersearch to find the errors because CtagsSideKick does not report parse errors to ErrorList.

    <body>Thanks to everyone who took the trouble to answer. What I really like about jEdit is the "vast" amount of screen real-estate I get for the text/code I work on. If I need Hypersearch (etc.) occasionally, I close it immediately after I'm finished, so I'm not really using the extra space. A few comments: 1. I am not a mouse person so I the first thing I did when installing jEdit many years ago was to get rid of the toolbar :-). 2. Thanks for the suggestion about fullscreen!! I didn't notice it before. 3. My next project is a LaTeX book. I couldn't get CTagsSideKick to work with LaTeX ... . I did get Sidekick to work with LaTeXTools but I'm not sure that is worthwhile. I've been living OK with a few commandos I wrote with keyboard shortcuts defined. When I need to navigate, search or hypersearch works extremely well. 4.

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Using jEdit on a widescreen</header>
    <body>I am about to buy a new laptop and they all have "wide" screens. Since I use a relatively large font, the shortened height of these screens means that I will see fewer lines in a text area and this is serious for editing latex documents or computer programs. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to utilize the extra width of the screen to make up for the lower height? I see that I can open new views or split views into panes, but I can't see much difference between them in terms of the editing experience. What considerations should guide the choice of one over the other? But ... I don't usually work on two files simultaneously or two portions of a file, so what I would really like is for a continuous portion of text to be shown in two side-by-side textareas, while the movement of the caret or the scolling is synchronized. Is that possible? Thanks Moti</body>

    <body>Hi, Please see my reply below, in between your text. Shlomy Moti.Ben-Ari@...&amp;gt; wrote: You can add dockable windows to the right and left of the edit pane (or text area). Some dockables provide you with quick navigation. For example: - SideKick provides a tree layout of the current buffer. For source code, you can usually use CtagsSideKick to show you the list of source code elements in the buffer and use a single click to jump to them. - The jEdit Markers (or the MarkerSets plugin) can let you quickly jump to places in the code where you've added markers. - Hypersearch / LucenePlugin show you the results of a search and let you jump quickly to each of the results. I usually use SideKick + CtagsSideKick for quick navigation of source code. I see that I can open new views or split views into panes, but I can't see A view is another top-level window (which would normally appear in you task bar as another task). As such it takes more screen space (e.g. its own title, menu, frame, dockables etc). Splitting a view into panes just requires a separator line between the panes. That's an interesting idea, but unfortunately there is not such feature currently in jEdit. I haven't checked, but it might be easy to set up such a thing using a BeanShell macro - splitting the edit pane vertically, setting the top displayed line to be the next line after the lowest displayed line in the other pane, and finally synchronizing the scrollbars (this "finally" is the most complex part but it might be easy - need to check the code for that).

    <header>Re: [ jEdit-users ] Using jEdit on a widescreen</header>
    <body>I have a short-cut (I use Control-shift-T) to toggle the toolbar.  I really don't use the toolbar that much since most of my actions are either keyboard shortcuts or right-click context menu operations.  You can also add things to the context menu that you might have on the toolbar, so you don't need it as much.  That and keyboard shortcuts can really save time while you are editing files. Thanks, Forrest Sent from my Dell Optiplex 760 PC with Windows XP Professional SP3 and Microsoft Outlook 2007. -----Original Message----- From: Mordechai Ben-Ari [mailto:Moti.Ben-Ari@...] Sent: Thursday, December 23, 2010 3:57 AM To: jedit-users@... Subject: [ jEdit-users ] Using jEdit on a widescreen I am about to buy a new laptop and they all have "wide" screens. Since I use a relatively large font, the shortened height of these screens means that I will see fewer lines in a text area and this is serious for editing latex documents or computer programs. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to utilize the extra width of the screen to make up for the lower height? I see that I can open new views or split views into panes, but I can't see much difference between them in terms of the editing experience. What considerations should guide the choice of one over the other? But ... I don't usually work on two files simultaneously or two portions of a file, so what I would really like is for a continuous portion of text to be shown in two side-by-side textareas, while the movement of the caret or the scolling is synchronized. Is that possible?

    <header>[ jEdit-users ] Edit mode for specific file extensions</header>
    <body>Hi, I am using JEdit on Linux. Many times I edit *.conf files, and usually I change the Edit mode to shellscript (By Utilities-&amp;gt;Buffer Options-&amp;gt;Edit Mode). In this way, commented lines (which start with #) are colored differently , and viewing the file this way seems to me much better. I want that permanently, files which are ended with .conf will have shellscript edit mode. Can this be achieved ? Rgs, Mark</body>

    <body>Yes. Go to global options, editing. Click the dropdown for 'change settings for mode' and select shellscript. Uncheck 'use default settings' and add .conf to the file globs.

    <body>It looks like there are a couple of last minute fixes people want to slide in before calling 4.4 "final". Which means that what you can get now in the daily builds, versioned "4.4", is going have to be called something else, perhaps: "4.4final" before it is officially released.  Please try out the pre-release directory containing the daily builds of the 4.4 branch and see if there are any other new issues that have to be addressed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Oracle to DB2 Conversion Guide: Learn learn about native support for PL/SQL, new data types, scalar functions, improved concurrency, built-in packages, OCI, SQL*Plus, data movement tools, best practices and more.  _______________________________________________ jEdit Announcement List jEdit-announce@...</body>

This makes reading files which contain text in multiple scripts more bearable. (Marcelo Vanzin) - Fixed ModeCatalogHandler so if an edit mode in the user-specific catalog has the same name as an edit mode in the system catalog, the version in the user-specific catalog will override the system default.

And this is **very very** annoying. Moreover, I tried to upgrade to higher versions of JEdit (which must have JAVA 1.5 or 1.6) and still this same problem exist.

    <body>Alan, Thanks! I have this problem with Sun Java 1.5. (I mean that this is the path that it has in /usr/local/bin/jedit). There is another Java on this machine but JEdit does not use it. I have this problem with 64 bit machine running Fedora 13. I had installed it using the installer. It is strange to me that other people did not yell about this problem, since it seems to me that it shoud  occur to everybody installing Jedit on fedora with Sun Java which is 1.5 or higher. Two more questions: 1) what is the display manager ? KDE? GNOME ? 2) is it 64 bit java or 32 bit java?

    <body>I am using KDE4, on a 64-bit architecture. The java I am using is an "amd64" architecture. Package: sun-java6-jdk Priority: optional Section: non-free/java Maintainer: Debian Java Maintainers Architecture: amd64 I don't run java 1.5 anymore since jedit now requires 1.6 and i can't even get 1.5 from my debian package sources anymore.
