    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Architecture Modified</header>
    <date>Tue Nov 13 16:56:00 CET 2001</date>
    <body>Hi folks, I have modified the architecture, to include the change I spoke of = last. Now, the parser throws an exception if no scanners have been = registered. This feature can be turned off by setting a boolean flag, = but by default it is set to true. Also, a static method called registerScanners is now available in = HTMLParser, which will register some of the common scanners. Hopefully, this will alleviate much of the confusion being caused by = the scanner registration process. Regards, Somik</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Re: HTML TABLE PARSER</header>
    <date>Mon Jan 21 01:17:00 CET 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Rohit, For including your own scanner type, you would need to do something like this : [1] HTMLTableTag - the tag that stores the data of the table tags [2] HTMLTableScanner - the class which does the scanning - implement the two template methods : (i) evaluate() - returns true if the tag name is "TABLE". false otherwise (ii) scan() - returns the HTMLTableTag object from the available text data. Here, you will be having the tag contents, and you will need to extract the relevant data out, construct the table object appropriately and return it. Finally, you need to register this scanner. Thats it - after this, table object will be identified. All the scanners in the library were written with this architecture in mind. Check out the entire scanners package, in particular, HTMLLinkScanner. Check out the corresponding test cases (in scannersTests package), and you should get a clear idea of the usage. Also - could you subscribe to the HTMLParser User's list, and mail your queries to that single mail id.

    <body>Yes - this should be possible. You have to process a HTMLTag, and check if it is a DIV tag. If yes, you can use the parseParameters() to get the CLASS value.

    <date>Mon Mar 11 10:51:00 CET 2002</date>
    <body>Hi All, how do I parse an HTML document and obtain the value of a tag in that document. Suppose if I have an html document named Table.html which contains a table will cells having HREF to another document which also contains a table, I should be first able to obtain the HREF and then the table content. I am not able to find out a way to obtain a parser object from the HTMLEditorKit. Can some one please post a code snippet of parsing the HTML and obtaining the attribute value of any HREF which can specified from the command line. Something like java TestParser Table.html HREF should read the Table.html file and the output on the console has to be the value of HREF Thanks, Kalyan This message is confidential and may also be legally privileged.

Please download htmlparser from http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net You will find the documentation as well with all info. To try it immediately after downloading it, you can try : run.bat http://www.yahoo.com Type run.bat to get options for your switches. In your question - you want to only extract links. So you can do : run.bat http://www.yahoo.com -l This will only show you the links.

    <body>hi Somik, I have tried urls http://www.nba.com , http://www.yahoo.com which seem to have lot of links. yahoo.com has 191 links when I tried. I wrote a small class Parser.java which I am mailing as an attachment. everytime I run my project using JBuilder after a series of parsing it throws a OutOfMemoryError. since I am using JBuilder I havent set any -ms or -mx parameters to run my Parser.java. so you might want to try it out. and the other thing I noticed while running the Parser.java was at the LinkScanner in the extractLink() method for a particular &amp;lt;a tag I get relativeLink as "null" and then when we do "return (new HTMLLinkProcessor()).extract(relativeLink,url);" it throws  a NullPointerException in that method since relativeLink is null. The exact place it throws a NullPointerException is "if (link.indexOf(" http://")==-1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; link.indexOf("mailto:")==-1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; url != null)" in "checkIfLinkIsRelative" method of HTMLLinkProcessor. this could be fixed. I fixed it....but the OutOfMemoryError seems to be potentially dangerous.

    <body>Hi Annette, Thanks for the report, I wrote a functional testcase, to do a raw = check IMG tags, and with the parser, and could reproduce the bug.

Since your app specifically needs to check only image scanners, = replace the line : parser.registerScanners();=20 with parser.addScanner(new HTMLImageScanner("-i"));=20 I checked that all the yahoo image tags come fine with this change. = The functional test has been checked into CVS (FunctionalTests.java), = and the one with registerScanners() fails. The corresponding unit test = in HTMLImageScanner passes. Meanwhile, I am trying to find out which scanner is messing up.. Thanks again for your report.

    <body>Hi Annette, I just figured out what is happening... Sorry for the previous mail - this is not a bug in the parser. You see - the tags which werent getting reported as image tags, were sandwiched between link tags &amp;lt;A HREF="..."&amp;gt;&amp;lt;IMG ..&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/A&amp;gt;. Hence, in your application, you will also need to watch out for link tags, and pick up the images from within should there be any. Now - if this causes you additional headaches, then dont register all the scanners, so the link scanner will not interfere, and you will only get the image tags. In order to prove that this analysis is correct - I added one more test case to HTMLImageScannerTest.java - testImageTagsFromYahooWithAllScannersRegistered() This test case extracts the link and checks that the image is found within. Also no of tags found is verified. You can check out this code from CVS, it might help you if you are interested in getting image tags out of link tags. Correspondingly, there is also testImageTagsFromYahoo() which passes (with only html image scanner registered). Let me know if you need further help.

    <body>Hi Mats Please dont send large attachments on the list. You could have sent that previous mail personally to me. Regarding your query - I tried the program with Sweden as the param and that worked fine for me. Though I am kind of surprised - you werent importing an Enumeration, so how did you get your program to compile ? Please read up on Exception handling in Java : http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/firstencounter . html http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/dealing.html Wrap up your suspected code within a try-catch block - catching a generic Exception, and print the stack trace by e.printStackTrace(). These queries are more related to Java than to the html parser - so its better if we take this off the list, and you can mail me personally at somik@... if you have doubts.

When you get the exception - you should also get a stack trace, telling you which part of the system through the exception, and how the exception travelled along the system.

So i need Webviewer to be changed in order to work = with htmlparser and i need the classes used from the html parser to be = sent to me (as all of them will not be used for just extracting links). = So i want all my programs just to be in one directory when i get them = and run them so i dont have any package com.kizna....... import = com.kizna........ etc.. in the programs. Please run WebViewer and you = will understand more clearly what i mean. Thanks for your time, Mats</body>

    <body>&amp;gt;So i want all my programs just to be in one directory when i get them and run them so i dont have any package WebViewer and you will understand Bytway, thats a funny requirement.. I mean, you cant get rid of import statements. But I can understand your wanting a single jar package. For this - its a good idea to use optimizer programs which leave out any classes not referenced. But if you want to do it by hand, then you can comfortably leave out all the scanners except HTMLTagScanner (of course :) and HTMLLinkScanner. And in the tags package, leave out all the tags except HTMLTag (of course :) and HTMLLinkTag. That should give you the minimal version you want. Regards, Somik Sent: Friday, April 19, 2002 7:49 PM Subject: [Htmlparser-user] applet based Hello, I was wondering if it is possible that you could help me with the following. If you have not got time to do this i understand. I have been trying it code this but cannot make it work and i am streesed for time to complete it. I want my WebViewer program (attached) to be run under emacs in windows. This will display a window where i can enter a url at the top. Once enter is pressed i want WebViewer to work with htmlparser to extract the links of that HTML page and return them below in the window as a result. The way in which WebViewer works now is that it only shows the HTML page of the url entered. So i need Webviewer to be changed in order to work with htmlparser and i need the classes used from the html parser to be sent to me (as all of them will not be used for just extracting links). So i want all my programs just to be in one directory when i get them and run them so i dont have any package com.kizna....... import com.kizna........ etc.. in the programs. Please run WebViewer and you will understand more clearly what i mean. Thanks for your time, Mats</body>

    <date>Wed Apr 17 02:29:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Mats, HTMLParser.elements returns an Enumeration. So you can enumerate through a list of nodes. This is actually the Iterator design pattern. HTMLNode is the interface that represents just about any kind of html element. The element might be a string node, a remark node, a tag, or end tag. If it is a tag - then there are several types of tags - and that forms another hierarchy. All this is explained with class diagrams at : http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/design/index.html http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/design/tags.html (this shows the HTMLNode particularly). To use the parser is quite simple - from the user perspective, you only need a loop - // Now you have an object of type HTMLNode. // This is however of a type which implements HTMLNode. So you can use instanceof if you are interested // in particular types. Or you can use reflections to find out information about the object itself. The former is usually // what is used by most folks. // Suppose you want to only print strings, you will want to take action if the node is a HTMLStringNode // Yes, now we can downcast it to HTMLStringNode // Print the contents of the string node HTH. Pls feel free to ask any questions that you have.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Major bug fix - spaces in links and images are now handled</header>
    <date>Mon Apr 15 05:14:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, Thanks to Sam Joseph (creator of Neurogrid). Sam is using the parser = in the neurogrid project, and has pointed out a bug that slipped our = attention. If links or image urls contain spaces, those spaces were = being absorbed. That is incorrect behaviour, especially if you have = something of the form : http://myservlet.com/someservlet?name=3DSam Joseph&amp;amp;age=3D22 The same goes for images like http://www.kizna.com/images/kizna corp.jpg Also - previously, newline character were being converted to spaces. = This has been modified - new line characters are left as is. The = responsibility to deal with them is now with the appropriate scanner. = So, the link and image scanners specifically filter out the newline = characters, whereas jsp tags which might have jsp code - would like to = preserve the new line chars. Over 73 testcases now in the htmlparser, and all passing.. I think we're ready for release 1.1 now, unless I get any more bug = reports this week. You can check out the latest code from CVS.

    <body>Hi Raghav As soon as I can wrap it up. Technically, the code is ready and already checked into CVS. I need to do the process of creating a release - make some documentation, check everything is ok, .. If I had some help I could wrap it up sooner. Yes - parseParameters() will give you the stuff inside the FORM tag. That is what I call "microscopic" parsing. But to get the remaining tags - till you encounter &amp;lt;/FORM&amp;gt; you need to do "macroscopic" parsing. This is not hard- check HTMLAppletScanner as an example. In a nutshell - concept is very simple. The scan method provides you with a reader. So you are to use that reader to read ahead and get the next tags. This is simple bcos the reader will automatically identify the correct tags, and the mechanism is very similar to using the parser to get the tags you want. The HTMLLinkScanner among others, also works on the same principle. Bytway - I think we should take this discussion to the Developer list.

    <date>Sat Apr 06 13:53:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hello again, I think I have figured out how to do it. Its as follows: - I have written two programs called WebPage (which is a static utility = class that provides operations for downloading web pages) and = WebPageViewer (contains utilities to download and display HTML pages). = So if i run WebPageViewer i just enter my search at the top (which makes = the yahoo search url with my search) and it displays the yahoo search = page for this search because the beginning URL is the standard yahoo = search url. So can i not some how get the htmlparser (just the extract = link programs) to work with my WebPage Viewer so that i enter a search = like before but this time the HTML page shown in my window is just the = extracted links? Can I do this? If so how? This would mean that I dont = need a servlet or something else. I have attached my two programs so you = can have a look at them and run them if you want. They are quite basic = and really i want them to contain a text field where i can enter my = search without the basic yahoo search url been shown and then have a = search button i can press to perform the search instead of pressing = enter.=20 Thanks, Mats</body>

This program will print only the email addresses on a page (which are also link tags). Its even simpler to simply filter out all the tags except the link tags. Try this : HTMLParser parser = new HTMLParser(" http://myurl.com node = (HTMLNode)e.nextElement();   // Get the next html node // Yes - this is a web link. Now you can downcast and do what you want with it System.out.println("link to "+linkTag.getLink()+", link text = This should give you what you want.

    <body>Hi Somik, I was using the 1.1 version of htmlparser. I save the http://www.yahoo.com content in a flat file yahoo.txt. and I run the parser against this. throws a nullpointerexception in HTMLScriptScanner. this seems to be a new addition for 1.1. I will send the stacktrace, the main program and the yahoo.txt. actually I cannot send the stacktrace. I made some changes and the line numbers dont match. but if you run this program you would see the nullpointerexception.

    <body>Hi Raghav, On analyzing yahoo.txt, I found that you have incorrect html. There = is a script tag that has not been closed. So naturally the script = scanner goes bonkers. Rename the extension to .html, and open this file = in IE, and you will find that IE also cant handle this. I verified from http://www.yahoo.com , and found that they do have the = correct &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; tag provided. So I guess your yahoo.txt file is = faulty.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Swing integration</header>
    <date>Wed May 08 09:50:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Posted this earlier, seems to have got lost.... ---- Hi Somik, I'm looking into the HTMLParser-Swing integration again, and I have two questions: 1. The HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback takes a position with most of its callback functions. Can this position be extracted from the HTMLTag's elementBegin()? 2. There is a need to differentiate between a callback to handleSimpleTag(HTML.Tag t, MutableAttributeSet a, int pos) and handleStartTag(HTML.Tag t, MutableAttributeSet a, int pos) when iterating through the HTMLTag elements Enumeration. How? You mentioned you have started an implementation - if you have a framework going, I'd be happy to continue with the donkey work. I really think this could make Swing's HTML rendering a lot more stable. Regards, Craig -----Original Message----- From: Somik Raha [mailto:somik@...] Sent: 16 April 2002 04:57 AM To: htmlparser-developer@... Cc: Craig Raw Subject: Re: [Htmlparser-user] Swing integration Hi Craig, Asgher I finally had the time to check Swing integration. Boy - the parser design in Swing sucks!! Theoretically its possible to do it - and I got started, but just realized that in order to be compatible with swing objects that do compile time type checking with a particular tag, I have to actually have 73 if statements to give the right tag to the callback. I have more important things to do at the moment, but probably will get back to this donkey work. *sigh* I am thinking we should make release 1.1 and then try this. Any suggestions ?

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Design Modifications to the HTMLNode API</header>
    <date>Tue May 07 06:29:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, Following some nice suggestions from Sam Joseph, I have just = completed some design modifications to the basic HTMLNode API. The modifications are : [1] HTMLNode is no longer an interface, but an abstract class. There = were two reasons for this change. Firstly, I couldnt think of a scenario = where an object would be an html tag AND something else. Secondly, I = wanted to enforce the implementation of toString(), which is usually = done if you implement from the interface (as Object has a default = toString()). [2] abstract toString() method - children have to implement this. [3] print() and print(PrintWriter) - final methods. They will make a = call to toString(), and print to standard output and the print writer = respectively. [4] toPlainText() - this method will provide a string representation of = a tag, if there is such a representation. If not , a blank string is = returned. This has implications - our program to extract all strings = from a html page will be simplified to: System.out.println(node.toPlainTextString()); // or whatever = processing you want to do with the string [5] toRawString() - this method provides the complete html element (a = reconstruction), thus allowing ripping programs to be really simple. So = if you want to rip the html page to your local hard disk, your program = would look like, [6] Lots of bug fixes done - HTMLImageScanner had a bug, = HTMLStyleScanner also had one - all caught with more testcases. We have 100 testcases as of now, all of them passing. To-do list for Release 1.2 ------------------------------------ [1] Integration of Raghavender Srimantula's contribution - = HTMLFrameScanner and HTMLFormScanner, into the parser. This will be = integrated as soon as I get the testcases from Raghav. [2] Adding an HTML Ripping program in the parserApplications package. [3] Improving the Robot Crawler (??) [4] Bug fixes to any bugs that get reported in this period. You can check out the latest code from CVS. Or you can go to = http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net and click on the download link, and = choose htmlparser1_2_20020507.zip Feedback is welcome. Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi Folks, If you've been following the latest exchange on htmlparser-user, = Annette has shown us a crazy example of dirty html, which works in the = browser, but crashes the parser. The site is http://www.cia.gov =20 Search for this string - &amp;lt;font face=3D"Arial,"helvetica," and you will find it in the html. Now this erroneous inverted comma = in front of helvetica should not be there.=20 This has been captured in a test case in HTMLTagTest.java (you can = get it from CVS), and this test fails (testParsing()). The problem is - the core parsing mechanism ignores anything within = inverted commas. This is critical so as to be able to accept angular = brackets in inverted commas. If we remove this feature from the parser = other tests will break. =20 So I need some suggestions on how we might modify our parsing - how = do we intelligently understand that this is an error (how easy it is for = us humans to figure this out) ? Looks like linear approaches wouldnt = work anymore... Maybe we need to associate some intelligence - that if = its a font tag, then this kind of stuff is most definitely an error. = Whereas if its a jsp tag, we can get more strict with our parsing. This = will probably cause a fundamental shift in our core parsing technique. Regards, Somik</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Annette's bug(Dirty HTML) fixed - Some intelligence added to the parser</header>
    <date>Fri May 03 08:15:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, We seem to have a heroic parser now... You can check out the latest code from CVS. Here's the fix. As you know - if we have an additional erroneous = inverted comma in a tag, the parser cannot judge whether to treat this = as erroneous or valid. Now the parser has some amount of intelligence - = if it encounters an inverted comma, and a close tag character, then it = does a check to see whether it should treat this as an error or a valid = character. This decision making process is facilitated with a strictVector - = which holds the tags for which it should not make allowances. Currently, = there is only one - "INPUT" (Should we have any more? ). If the tag = being parsed is not a strict tag like INPUT, then it is assumed that = this is an erroneous tag and needs to be corrected. The correction process occurs (and is validated with some testcases = in HTMLTag - particularly testStrictParsing). If you go thru that = testcase - you will see that the attributes are also correctly = retrieved. This solution doesent break anything else - we have 82 testcases, = all passing. I'd be grateful if folks can test this version and let me know if = this solution is acceptable. =20 Also - a general question - would you prefer something like nightly = drop packages for downloading, or is a request to checkout from CVS fine = ? Thanks and Regards, Somik   =20</body>

    <body>Hi Cedric, Thanks for this fix.

Should I catch this error and write my own code around ? Its highly abnormal... It should not happen - are you trying it with the = same piece of html ? Send me the data you are trying on. If its the same = page, it works perfectly on my end. I am running HTMLParser (main) with = no params except the file name. Other question, I can't run the software with two options. Is-it normal = ?=20 Why don't you set the options before the name of the file to parse ? Yes, this is normal (a feature, not a bug). This is bcos the options are = intended only as a demo, and I didnt think it'd really be of use to = people. Are you actually using it this way ? Also, another thing is I am = not full time on this, so I'd be grateful if you can join up as a = developer and make this fix. All code recieved from developers is acknowledged both in the code, and = the Contributors page that goes out with each release. You can send me = your sourceforge id and I can add you as a developer. It can be used like this: public HTMLStringNode(String text,int textBegin,int textEnd) You can implement it with the meta-tags, ... This is cool. I think it will be useful in the toPlainString() method, = where we can get the actual meaningful text out. I'd be glad to include = this as soon as I find some time. Or Tariq can also join as a developer = and I can give him CVS access to do it. Thanks a lot for your participation. Cheers, Somik</body>

I'll check out the latest integration build to see if the same problems exist. I'd like to hear your view(s) on writing to the console. In production releases this should never happen. If necessary, I'd encourage the use of a reporting callback, something like the SAX ErrorHandler class, say: public interface HTMPParserFeedback With a DefaultHTMPParserFeedback implementation that goes to the console. public class DefaultHTMPParserFeedback implements HTMPParserFeedback public void info(String message) public void warning(String message) public void error(String message, HTMLParserException e) This approach is especially conducive to user-configuration and helps elliminate errant output to the console. You can also add a debug(String message) method here as well. The callback enables the user of the library to send relevant output to either or all of: the console, log files, streams, etc. Of course, fatal errors should be still thrown back up the calling tree through exceptions, but non-fatal errors can easily be caught this way. To simplify usage, you can use a Factory/Manager class with static methods, like: public class FeedbackManager public static void setParserFeedback(HTMPParserFeedback feedback) public static void info(String message) public static void warning(String message) public static void error(String message, HTMLParserException e) In practice, the inline code/usage looks like this: ... // General feedback ... // Non fatal exception try catch (NonFatalException e) FeedbackManager.error("more specific description of problem, in ... // Fatal exception try catch (FatalException e) ... Not sure if this is helpful, but it's a strategy that's worked incredibly well for me, ultimately usuable for both end-users and developers who are working on the library itself. -----Original Message----- From: Somik Raha [mailto:somik@...

Subject: Re: [Htmlparser-user] Testing/feedback, question Dear Claude, Great - this will be a great service to this project and its community. Thank you very much. Hmm.. although I agree with this, I have a question - what do you see being written to standard err ? My understanding is that, when the parser crashes, it usually throws an exception all the way up - so if you wrap your parsing block (the for loop) in a try-catch and look for a simple exception, you would be able to catch it. errors Sounds interesting. Even if we cant get the data that you tested with, we could simulate an equivalent testcase... Cool. Looking forward to it.

    <body>I have confirmed that the integration build has the same System.err (my mistake below, writing System.out) output in HTMLParser. Here are a couple of quick observations that may lead to potential improvements: 1) There is command line handling and connection-oriented code in HTMLParser. This code should be uncoupled. Perhaps an HTMLParserMain class to handle the command line wrapper, keeping the HTMLParser code dedicated to parsing? 2) Thanks for filling in the toString methods in 1.2. I had noticed most missing in 1.1 and was concerned. While there's room for minor improvement (the use of StringBuffer to build strings and a consistent naming conventions), these are minor quips. I've found it useful to have a void toString(StringBuffer buffer); method variant in container classes, for building up strings from contained classes more efficiently. 3) I love the existence of the toHTML(); methods. 4) I see it's now possible to get something by calling getTag. This was missing in 1.1. Thanks. 5) I noticed a lot of code in the HTMLTag class which is 'private static'. This suggests the need for an external class to handle this type of work. At peripheral glace, I'm presuming you're functioning as a Finite State Machine (thus the 'automata' prefix)? Thanks for the big investment. I'd be happy to spend a little time helping with some of the grunt work. If you think the use of the Callback mechanism is good, for example, I could replace all the System.out and System.err for you and send you the code. 6) I noticed that you don't have a custom exception class. I have code kicking around that implements chained exceptions (as in Java 1.4) but is compatible with earlier Java versions. Chained exceptions are incredibly useful for wraping underlying exceptions into higher-level exceptions while retaining the stack trace. This results in highly usable libraries because it provides suitable high-level explanations of a problem, while retaining lower level context. 7) I also have a very simple but versatile command line handler class that you can use if you like. It lets you retrieve arguments as either flags or parameter-followed options, single or multiple letter commands, order-depentent, etc. While simple, this is one of those classes that nobody should live without ;-). -----Original Message----- From: Claude Duguay=20 Sent: Tuesday, June 25, 2002 9:19 AM To: htmlparser-user@...

I'll check out the latest integration build to see if the same problems exist. I'd like to hear your view(s) on writing to the console. In production releases this should never happen. If necessary, I'd encourage the use of a reporting callback, something like the SAX ErrorHandler class, say: public interface HTMPParserFeedback With a DefaultHTMPParserFeedback implementation that goes to the console. public class DefaultHTMPParserFeedback implements HTMPParserFeedback public void info(String message) public void warning(String message) public void error(String message, HTMLParserException e) This approach is especially conducive to user-configuration and helps elliminate errant output to the console. You can also add a debug(String message) method here as well. The callback enables the user of the library to send relevant output to either or all of: the console, log files, streams, etc. Of course, fatal errors should be still thrown back up the calling tree through exceptions, but non-fatal errors can easily be caught this way. To simplify usage, you can use a Factory/Manager class with static methods, like: public class FeedbackManager public static void setParserFeedback(HTMPParserFeedback feedback) public static void info(String message) public static void warning(String message) public static void error(String message, HTMLParserException e) In practice, the inline code/usage looks like this: ... // General feedback ... // Non fatal exception try catch (NonFatalException e) FeedbackManager.error("more specific description of problem, in ... // Fatal exception try catch (FatalException e) ... Not sure if this is helpful, but it's a strategy that's worked incredibly well for me, ultimately usuable for both end-users and developers who are working on the library itself. -----Original Message----- From: Somik Raha [mailto:somik@...

Subject: Re: [Htmlparser-user] Testing/feedback, question Dear Claude, Great - this will be a great service to this project and its community. Thank you very much. Hmm.. although I agree with this, I have a question - what do you see being written to standard err ? My understanding is that, when the parser crashes, it usually throws an exception all the way up - so if you wrap your parsing block (the for loop) in a try-catch and look for a simple exception, you would be able to catch it. errors Sounds interesting. Even if we cant get the data that you tested with, we could simulate an equivalent testcase... Cool. Looking forward to it.

    <body>Here are some test results I thought you may be interested in: We ran about 58k files through our conversion process using both the old, Swing-based HTML parser and the new HTMLParser solution yesterday. Some of these files are not HTML and are routed to other parsers, but this particular set of files was especially problematic with the Swing parser. The exact nature of the Swing parser problem is a reallocation of buffer space with too small an increment deep down inside the parser code. In effect, some ungodly low number (4-8) of bytes are alllocated as the string grows each time, causing an array copy each time with a growing string. This is problematic when handling files with large text content tags. Using the old (Swing) parser, we processed 57952 documents, encountered 67 errors, ran in 10305 minutes (several days), with an original aggregate file size of 6,252,739,014 bytes and a converted document collection size around 761,653,928 bytes. Using the new (HTMLParser) parser, we processed 58113 documents, encountered 69 errors, ran in 294 minutes, with an original aggregate file size of 6,256,488,243 bytes and a converted document collection size around 431,198,296 bytes. While this is not a conclusive test - there are clearly discrepencies between the two conversion runs that need to be resolved, such as different output size counts, which are attributable to changes we have made - the timing different is impressive: Going from 10305 minutes to 294 minutes, is just over 35 times faster. This is mostly attributable to the problematic files in this test set, which took on the order of hours to process each. Yet clearly the HTMLParser solution overcomes a serious bug in the Swing parser (which cannot be patched by anyone but Sun or it's Java license holders - given the way the Java license agreement it written). Note that the same low-level reallocation of string resources in the Swing parser is less problematic in cases where less text is found between each tag, but the performance differences should still be sigificant taken over a large set of files. I will share what I can as we learn more.</body>

    <body>Dear Claude, Great mail to read. Bytway, as I understand you've used v1.1 for these tests. However, I have made some special optimizations in v1.2, particularly to improve scalability. The String node parser now creates only one HTMLStringNode object for continuous text. So if you had 10,000 lines, v1.1 would create 10,000 objects, while v1.2 would create only one. The other scanners also have been optimized. I think this would result in a substantial improvement in your test results. Bytway, do you think you can write an article about your tests - we could put it up on the HTMLParser page. Also, send me your sourceforge id, I'd like to add you as a developer to this project, so that you can check in improvement directly to CVS.

    <body>&amp;gt;Looks like the output is on System.out: Oh yes - but these are pretty bad errors, bcos the parsing cant happen as the resource couldnt be found. Maybe instead of a callback, we should throw exceptions here. The idea of a callback is also very good - we might be able to use it to report warnings when the parser needs to auto-adjust erroneous tags.. But that would add to the weight of the parser. The issue is : CallBack vs. exception. In the latter case, the parser does not have to worry about recovery, thus keeping it really compact. However, in the former case, the parser has to have recovery code in case of fatal errors.. What are your thoughts ? Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>1) There is command line handling and connection-oriented code in HTMLParser. This code should be uncoupled. Perhaps an HTMLParserMain class to handle the command line wrapper, keeping the HTMLParser code dedicated to parsing? Good suggestion. This refactoring should be done. 2) Thanks for filling in the toString methods in 1.2. I had noticed most missing in 1.1 and was concerned. While there's room for minor improvement (the use of StringBuffer to build strings and a consistent naming conventions), these are minor quips. I've found it useful to have a void toString(StringBuffer buffer); method variant in container classes, for building up strings from contained classes more efficiently. We need to go thru a phase of optimization looking at the strings used. = The toString(StringBuffer) method also sounds useful.=20 3) I love the existence of the toHTML(); methods. This was the suggestion of Sam Joseph (it used to be toRawString() in = older integration releases). Thanks Sam! 4) I see it's now possible to get something by calling getTag.

    <body>1) I have changed my schedule to accomodate yours to some degree. That = is to say, I've observed that your posts are always between 6pm and 2am = my time (Seattle) and that your company is in Tokyo. As such, I intend = to work between 6 and 9 local time to move this forward for a few days, = if I may. Cool! This collaboration will be fun. 2) My SourceForge ID is 'claudeduguay' but I have never used it (though = it's active - I just checked). I've added you as a developer. You can check out the code, and run the = build scripts. Instructions are at = http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=3D24399 3) I'll try to collect up what I can as we do these tests by writing to = this mailing list. I hope that will at least capture the information. = After we've collected enough useful data, I'll be happy to write = something up that coallesses as much as possible into a single document = for you. =20 Great. 4) I will work from home in the evenings and from the office in the = mornings this week, so I'll upgrade the product at work in the morning = to use the 1.2 integration release for subsequent testing. =20 Sounds good. Note that the tests are larely in-product tests for a document converter = which is part of a larger system. As such, the timing numbers I provide = will be for complete processing, including directory traversals, file = conversions and transmission times, through the bulk of this processing = is parsing. Transmissions are being done on a LAN so they are very fast = and file traversal time is negligeable. Cool. Bytway, could you subscribe to the htmlparser-developer mailing list ? = We could continue our collaboration on that list, and leave this forum = for user questions. = http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/htmlparser-developer Cheers, Somik</body>

    <body>WRT exception handling vs. feedback, only fatal exceptions should be = thrown and feedback, where you are currently using System.out or = System.err should go through an interface that users can reroute as they = might prefer (to logs, console or ignore them). I have written up the = classes and packaged them under the com.kizna.html.util package. I can = send these to you in any form you like. I agree. The existing System.err.println() statements - I think they all = indicate fatal errors - hence should be converted to an exception = throwing system. The Callback mechanism should also come in so we can start using it in = the rest of the library. Also - another issue I have been thinking of is SAX compliance. I dont = think it will be hard to make callbacks from the parse() method... What = do you think ? The files are: =20 HTMLFeedback DefaultHTMLFeedback FeedbackManager HTMLParserException (a chained exception class). =20 You put them in CVS. Do you think it'd be better to have a = com.kizna.html.exceptions package instead of util, for better naming = conventions ? I am debating whether to keep the ChainedException class as a base class = for more general use and use an HTMLParserException subclass. Any = thoughts? Hmm.. I'd need to see the code before I can comment. Since you are now going to be a developer - here are two important = guidelines (which you might be already following) : [1] all the code that is checked in must come with testcases and should = not break existing tests. As of now the parser is almost 100% covered by = tests. [2] The bug fixing strategy is - write a testcase to simulate the bug, = make the testcase fail, then fix the bug. Cheers, Somik</body>

    <body>1) Point me to something that will tell me how to setup CVS to get an = update and I try to get set up to check things in. From your other mail, it seems you got CVS to work. You definitely need = SSH to check in code - http://cdx.sourceforge.net/win-HOWTO.htm=20 I was using Tortoise CVS earlier - its important that you make a = checkout once using SSH from your dos shell. Then you can continue to = update and commit using Tortoise CVS. The better and more elegant option is to use Eclipse - the great free = Open Source IDE supported by IBM - it interfaces very cleanly with CVS = and SSH (extssh), and you dont need to setup anything. Lets continue our tech discussions on the developer list. Cheers, Somik</body>

    <body>1) SAX-compliance is a big feature question. What do you want to = support, the ContentHandler interface? You might also consider the = notion of using InputSource objects to fetch the stream (actually a = Reader) to process.=20 Actually I was referring to the latter, not the ContentHandler. The idea = is to swap an XMLParser with the HTMLParser without changing anything = else - so you ContentHandler can remain the same. I started doing some tinkering with this for an 'XML Magazine' article = (I write a column for both JavaPro and XML Magazine). I think I could = offer a useful class that you could build on for that... Sounds good. Do go ahead. 2) Re: Test cases. You need to know that I am offering time this week = for business reasons. Part of my objective it so ensure that the library = does not have any shortcomings that would impact my company's project. I = believe this to be mutually beneficial in that any such enhancements = should given freely to the HTMLParser community. I cannot, = unfortunately, commit much time, so you'll have to treat me as a limited = resource. =20 Fair enough. Its really nice of you to offer improvements back to the = project. We all work on this in a limited fashion - thats the OS = movement :) You will find that I work quickly and produce good quality code. My = documentation is also good, but my test cases are few and far between. I = hope you can help me compensate for this weakness, though I fully = understand the need for test cases. I have no doubt that you produce good quality code, the problem is = others (including myself) may not - and if your code doesent have its = own testcase, then someone could mess it and not get to know. Though to = begin with, I can put in whatever free time I have writing test cases = for your code - but that would be kind of slow. But dont let that stop = you  - it would be great to have your contributions. Cheers, Somik</body>

    <body>I've just started using the HTMLParser and hope to be able to provide improved throughput and reliability over the Swing HTML parser by applying this open source solution, hopefully offering bug fixes/enhancements back to the community. We have (my company) processed about 11 million HTML documents successfully (with the Swing parser), some of which we'll see tested again with the HTMLParser code in the next few weeks. To date, we have only run a few simple tests with the HTMLParser code but it appears now that the library is writing to standard err. I would expect all errors to result in parser-specific exceptions that the calling application would be free to handle as it may see fit. Some of the data we are processing is not publicly available. The errors we have seen are issues with vary large HTML files that were generated from log files. These are suprisingly common but offer a special challenge to HTML parsers in that they tend to contain large strings of log file information between &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; tags. We'll probably be running about 1 or 2 million files through the parser this week. I will try to report problems and get set up to build the library so that I can offer more specific class/line-based feedback/fixes. Thanks.</body>

    <body>Dear Claude, Great - this will be a great service to this project and its community. Thank you very much. Hmm.. although I agree with this, I have a question - what do you see being written to standard err ? My understanding is that, when the parser crashes, it usually throws an exception all the way up - so if you wrap your parsing block (the for loop) in a try-catch and look for a simple exception, you would be able to catch it. Sounds interesting. Even if we cant get the data that you tested with, we could simulate an equivalent testcase... Cool. Looking forward to it. Cheers, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi, Thanks for your reply Somik. I would like to say what a great package this is. I got the latest source files and tried what you said and it worked a treat. I'm going to modify the HTMLImageTag.toRawString() as you suggested. I'm not using the StringBuffer any more as I found out it is not necessary to send the Content-length field, I can just close the connection. I did have a bit of trouble compiling using jakarta-ant-1.4.1 probably due to the fact that I am not experienced with this package. I got this error using the ant.bat file that came with the package: E:\work\java\packages\htmlparser&amp;gt;ant.bat -verbose Ant version 1.4.1 compiled on October 11 2001 Buildfile: build.xml Detected Java version: 1.3 in: C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.1 Detected OS: Windows 2000 parsing buildfile E:\work\java\packages\htmlparser\build.xml with URI = file:E:/ work/java/packages/htmlparser/build.xml Project base dir set to: E:\work\java\packages\htmlparser BUILD FAILED Target `dist' does not exist in this project. at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.tsort(Project.java:873) at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.topoSort(Project.java:818) at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeTarget(Project.java:594) at org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeTargets(Project.java:560) at org.apache.tools.ant.Main.runBuild(Main.java:454) at org.apache.tools.ant.Main.start(Main.java:153) at org.apache.tools.ant.Main.main(Main.java:176) Total time: 0 seconds The version property from build.xml is 1_2_20020616 and I didn't change the directory structure after I checked out the HTMLParser code with CVS.

You can either check out the latest from CVS, or simply do this : Replace the first line of the ant script with and it will work.

Meanwhile, you can check out the fixed code from CVS.

    <date>Sun Jun 16 22:05:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi, I managed to get something working like this: sb is a StringBuffer and base is a URL (the source of the document) i'm just using just a single scanner - HTMLImageScanner. I didn't give it a filter because I don't understand what the filter does. // Run through an enumeration of html elements node = (HTMLNode)e.nextElement();    // Cast the element to HTMLNode //relative src Just a couple of questions if you don't mind. 1) is this the only way to get all the attributes in the img tag? 2) can you see any problems or suggest improvements? 3) (HTTP question) I'm adding all the output to a StringBuffer so that I can convert it to a byte array using sb.toString().getBytes() - I need to do this so that I can get the length of the byte array for use in the Content-length HTTP header field (the output is sent back to a browser). Do I need to do this or can I just omit the Content-length field and avoid using the StringBuffer? Another thing, I was testing the app on google.com and I noticed it has a strange image tag : &amp;lt; img width=1 height=1 alt="" &amp;gt; (no SRC attribute) Although the parser recognised it as an image tag, it didn't seem to pick up on the attributes. Is this a bug? _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp .</body>

    <date>Mon Jun 17 06:32:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Dear Rob, From your first mail : object Functionally, you only get one tag object. If you havent registered the concerned scanner (HTMLImageScanner in this case), you will get an HTMLTag object. If you have, then you will get an HTMLImageTag object. Technically, internally, first an HTMLTag object gets created. Then control passes to registered scanners to see if this tag can be upgraded. If so, the new sublcassed tag object (HTMLImageTag, for example) gets created and returned in place of the original HTMLTag. A filter is not required - it is only for using it from the command line - allows us to check parse results easily and dump it to a file. You can ignore it for your app - the following will work : Why are you declaring a linkProcessor ? file://relative src This is not necessary. The base url that you specify in the parser, will automatically be used to resolve relative links. Check out the testcases : testRelativeImageScan, testRelativeImageScan2, testRelativeImageScan3 in com.kizna.htmlTests.scannerTests.HTMLImageScannerTest I can also see that you are trying to reconstruct the html tag without changing its contents - you can do this with imageTag.toRawString() if you are using HTMLParser v1.2 upwards. However, this will provide you with the relative link (not resolved absolute link). Perhaps, if you need it, we can modify the toRawString() method, and get it to return absolute links ?? No. There's a much easier way - just do : If you want to get the keys, I think this should work : imageTag.getParsed().keys() [Maybe the name of this method should be changed to be easier to figure out]. Hmm.. Its not mandatory to send the content-length, but some servers expect it. To make life easier, you should use toRawString() to get the html tags out uniformly. Since this applied to a node, you dont have to write code for different types of nodes. So sb.append(node.toRawString()) is good enough (perhaps) for all nodes. The only one where there might be an issue is the HTMLImageTag for reasons that I mentioned above. You can probably rewrite the toRawString() method  in HTMLImageTag for your purposes and that should solve your problem neatly. Feel free to post any further questions that you have.

    <body>Hi all, I'm new to the list today after following the thread 'Hints on how to change image tag locations and write out document' in the archives. I'm trying to make an application that changes all relative img src attributes to absolute before writing out the entire document. I'd be very interested to see some of the code from the attachments from Somik Raha if somebody could post them. The archives don't seem to keep attachments. I just started using HTMLParser today and I'm currently stuck trying figure out how to get the complete IMG tag string when using an HTMLImageScanner. Am I correct in thinking that in both an HTMLTag and an HTMLImageTag object are created for each image tag encountered when using HTMLImageScanner? If so, does the HTMLTag object get populated with the usual data?

    <date>Tue Jun 11 16:05:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Greetings. I have started developing a solution with the HTMLParser and wanted to ask about a few specifics. The application extracts text, the title and some metadata (author, description, keywords - if present) from HTML documents for indexing purposes. I have successfully written code to access the content, title, and meta information but now need to put it in context. To do this, I would like to recognize the BODY tag's start and end. If I understand the architecture correctly, HTMLParser should allow me to register a simple HTMLTagScanner, but since this is an abstract class and the existing scanners don't suit my purpose, I presume I need to implement a subclass. Can someone show me how to subclass HTMLTagScanner to watch for a specific tag? PS: I've found the design and implementation to be quit nice as I use it, very simple to apply in practice. If the download bundle include source I would probably have just taken a look. I'm not adverse to using CVS but the setup time is sometimes prohibitive. Having a source bundle for download might be useful in future distributions. Thanks.</body>

Its very easy.=20 // This method is called to check if your scanner should be used. = Here's where you have to check if the scanner // should start // check if s contains the word body in it. if (s.toUpperCase().indexOf("BODY")=3D=3D0) return true; else = // This method is automatically called to ask your scanner to do the = creation.

Since you are tapping into low-level parsing, it is imperative that you = write test cases. The parserTests.scannersTests package contains sample = test code - which you can copy as a template to setup your testcases. = Its very easy, you can create dummy html code liked &amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;&amp;lt;STRONG&amp;gt;HELLO = WORLD&amp;lt;/STRONG&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/BODY&amp;gt;, and register your body scanner to see if it is = extracting data as you would expect.=20 Also - it is very important that you run parserTests.AllTests - which = will run the 100+ testcases in the existing parser to check if you broke = anything.

    <date>Sun Jul 28 07:26:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, This week's integration release is out - 1.2-2002_07_28. This contains some major bug fixes. They are : [1] Fixed bug in HTMLParser.openConnection(), mistaking files for urls if they contain "http" or "www" anywhere. [2] Updated HTMLEndTag, this was accidentally left out in the previous release. [3] Fixed Bug 586062 - relative links bug - if first char is a slash, then the subdirectories of the url need to be ignored. [4] Fixed Bug 586222 - HTMLRemarkNode bug - if a line with a remark ndoe contains a string before it, the string is ignored. [5] Fixed major bug - allowing auto-correction of malformed tags. Current code is very robust. Fix allowed removal of strictness vector concept, making the design simpler. [6] Fixed bug 586756 - in HTMLRemarkNode, if there are empty lines only, the finite state machine would crash My thanks to John Zook and Cedric Rosa for bug reports and suggestions. Bytway, the strictness vector concept has been removed as I mentiond in point [5] - this is probably the most important fix in this release. The parser now begins to show some intelligence- it can auto-correct tags and put inverted commas at the right places. All test cases are passing, and I have put in some intensive amount of testing. Tags like : can be handled now. In case 2 and 3 - the parser corrects them to We can also handle tags of a fourth kind : The criterion now is, if within the inverted comma, there is a begin tag, then we shall expect an end tag, and not think its an error. This is a fundamental change in the parsing automaton in HTMLTag.java. Regards, Somik</body>

First, I begin to fix this problem with prevent it to appear. In HTMLReader.java: ------------------------------ protected boolean readNextLine() if (posInLine!=-1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !(line != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node.elementEnd()+1&amp;gt;=line.length())) for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; line.length(); i++) if (line.charAt(i) != ' ') Then I read sources around and I remark it will be a better idea to patch HTMLStringNode.java The solution is to go in state 1 when you are at the end of a space string. if (state==1) //patch beginning here if (state==0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; i==input.length()-1) //patch ending here if (state==1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; i==input.length()-1) ///.....

    <body>We're not quite done yet... ;-) =20 Here are some numbers that reflect the differences with the larger files. This set is 57,952 files (6,256,488,243 bytes), many of which are several megabyte log file dumps to HTML (average file size for this set is 107,959 bytes). These are especially problematic for the Swing parser: =20 Time for Swing (in minutes): 10,305 (0.0937279 docs/sec) Time for HTMLParser 1.1 (in minutes): 294 (3.2943877 docs/sec) Time for HTMLParser 1.2 (in minutes): 311 (3.1665058 docs/sec) =20 Note that this run was done on a single box with no other parallel runs. Also, there was a variance of about 1000 files between runs that are reflected in the speed numbers. But I provided the average in the paragraph above, so you will not get exact results from recalculating from those numbers. Still, everything needs to be looked at in perspective. =20 Notable here is that the 1.2 version seems to be a tiny bit slower on big files. This is almost certainly due to string reallocation. As contiguous content gets larger, which can happen in any application that works heavily with string objects. It might be worth looking at whether this is addressable. Overall, though, HTMParser 1.2 is clearly an improvement over the most commonly used Java/HTML parser (ie: Swing) in use today ;-). -----Original Message----- From: Somik Raha [mailto:somik@...

    <body>The SWT is not a contender for replacing Swing. It may be an alternative, applicable in many circumstaces, but a quick look at the Sun's Swing connection should dissuade you from assuming that few people are using Swing. I would not endorse trying to make HTMLParser Swing-compatible. These are different animals and should stay that way. The notion of providing a SAX-like interface is interesting but you should look instead toward XML pull-parsers, which are the high-performance alternatives now surfacing more widely. There is a JSR ( http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/173.jsp ) that is trying to unify a good interface for pull-parsing (they're calling it a Streaming API). You'll find this link especially intersting ( http://www.xmlpull.org/ ). =20 HTMLParser has two fundamental strengths. 1) It's easy to use and extend. 2) It's lightning fast. =20 Don't lose sight of these distinctions. The whole XML community is strugling to achieve these goals and hasn't quite gotten there yet. There's much to learn from XML, but they are laregely moving in this direction. =20 BTW: JTidy is a serious performance bottleneck in a high-performance application. =20 -----Original Message----- From: Somik Raha [mailto:somik@...

    <body>Hi Cheng Thanks for the kind words. Regarding the bug, I would call it a feature :) When you parse a link within a url - if the link is relative, it = gets processed appropriately.

    <body>Hi Folks, Integration Release 1.2-2002_08_26 is out. From the change log : [1] Added new tag-scanner pairs for the following tags: (i) INPUT (ii) TEXTAREA (iii) OPTION (iv) SELECT [2] The newline character being used in toHTML() was different across different tags and also in some cases in scan() methods of scanners. It has been changed to pick up the system property "line.separator" from the JVM environment and that is used in toHTML() as well as scan(). Alternatively, users can set their own line separators using HTMLParser.setLineSeparator() or HTMLNode.setLineSeparator(). Both have the same effect. [3] Fixed HTMLRemarkNode bugs (594301) [1] and [2] were done by Dhaval Udhani, of OrbiTech Solutions Ltd. [3] was done by John Zook. John - thanks for sending in the bugs and = their fixes (its a pleasure to receive the latter with the bug reports). Cheers, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi, =A0 I would definitely appreciate converting the hard-coded end-of-line character with a detected end-of-line character from the system property. Currently I read the entire file and replace the hard-coded EOL with the system property EOL. =A0 I think the last EOL for toHTML() should be removed and instead all "\n" should be also parsed and reproduced exactly in the same way. Preserving layout shoudl be as important as performance. Also my feeling is that this tool will be used mostly by developers during development time and not at runtime(though it is always possible) and hence performance may not be an issue here. =A0 Please feel free to criticize my opinion. =A0 Typically my predicament is as follows : =A0 My team is=A0building a framework which is used by many projects in my organization. All the other projects create HTML with their own look-and-feel. To use the framework, they need to convert these files into a JSP(using a tool developed by my team). The tool apart from jsut changing the extension ;) also adds lots of JSP code and makes certain modifications to the HTML tags(not the presentation tags though). After the JSP is created if the layout changes, they will ahve to again spend time correcting this anomaly and will need to keep doing it everytime they change their HTML page or the tool is updated. Now I guess you can understand why I feel so strongly about maintaining layout. =A0 At the same time I am aware that the parser is here for everyone's need and will be driven accordingly. Hence am just presenting my point of view.

If we try to give the exact same output as originally parsed, the performance of the parser could be compromised.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Next integration release is out</header>
    <date>Sat Aug 10 08:15:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, Next release (v1.2-2002-08-11) is out. From the change log : [1] Fixed bug 590703 - Empty values dont get parsed [2] Fixed bug 591435 - Missing values cause keys to be missed [3] Removed all infinite loops in scanners, replaced with throwing HTMLParserException [4] Fixed bug in HTMLTitleScanner, allowing certain malformed title tags to be parsed [5] Modified HTMLReader - now accepts Reader instead of BufferedReader [6] HTMLParser constructor now throws HTMLParserException. [7] Fixed bug 592355 - Empty tags throw exceptions from some scanners. Now, if the tag is empty, it is not passed down to scanners. Also, fixed the related issue in HTMLStringNode, causing empty tags to be treated as tags and not strings. A very significant fix is #3 - I would highly recommend upgrading your copies asap. Also, following suggestions of Amit Rana, the constructor itself throws HTMLParserException. You can expect some more API changes in the coming weeks, as we attempt to integrate Claude's other contributions (Parser Feedback). We've got over 150 tests and all passing. Regards, Somik</body>

I've been thinking of introducing HTMLRenderers, for a tag - so you can = dynamically change it for the tags that you want.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] New Integration Release is out</header>
    <date>Sun Aug 04 07:22:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, Its time again, another integration release is out. Check = http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net . So whats new? Major API change - the parser now has chained = exceptions. If some problem occurs, your application will have a chance = to take care of it, instead of simply crashing. Also, the exception = messages are more meaningful, giving a better picture of what went = wrong. Thanks to Claude Duguay for the ChainedException classes, and bug = reports. And many thanks to the best tester of HTMLParser - Cedric Rosa = - for countless bug reports - pls keep up the good work. From the change log,=20 [1] Fixed bug 590250, problem in HTMLStringNode, by which a single character on the last line was causing a parser crash [2] Optimized and refactored HTMLParameterParaser.parseParameters() [3] Modified PerformanceTest to exclude first reading in average = computation [4] Fixed bug in HTMLParameterParser.parseParameters(), due to which params with spaces before =3D were not being picked up [5] Made massive API changes - throwing exceptions and using = HTMLEnumeration [6] Fixed HTMLRemarkNode bug - we can recognize stuff like  now. [7] Fixed HTMLImageScanner bug - we can now fix image tags like IMG SRC"somepic.jpg" - the missing equal to can be deduced [8] Fixed HTMLLinkScanner bug - end tags within a link were not being = included inside the link data. Please give your feedback regarding the API changes.=20 NOTE=20 [1] this release would break your existing applications due to the API = change. Simply wrap the parsing in a try-catch block to cath a = HTMLParserException and your apps should work again. [2] There is one known bug (590703) caught by two testcases in = parseParameters(). This is a minor bug which shouldnt affect = applications, and should be fixed in the next release. Cheers, Somik</body>

    <date>Thu Aug 01 02:42:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>I am trying to write my own scanner class. In the scan method what should be ideally returned? i.e. the Javadoc says that the return type is an HTMLNOde however I am not clear as to exactly what shoudl be returned. Can anyone help me out here? HTMLNode is only an abstract class. You should not worry about = implementing it completely, because it is already done in the HTMLTag = class. So your new tag type object should derive from HTMLTag. Take a look at the implementation of some of the existing scanners = (particularly HTMLMetaTagScanner).=20 Bytway, if you writing a new type of scanner - from your earlier mail - = the HTMLInputTagScanner, you might want to check it in to the main code = base so we can put it in with the main distribution and you'd also get = support for maintaining it.

    <header>Re: [Htmlparser-user] Attributes query</header>
    <date>Thu Aug 01 02:37:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>While using the parser, if I need to call HTMLTag.parseParameters(), I get a Hashtable. Will the keys in this hashtable be in the exact same case as they are in the HTML page or will they be in a standard form, all upper case or all lower case? Since in my project, my team works on HTMLs created by another team this could be in any case, however before conversion I would need to be able to read these attributes irrespective of case. Any ideas? Good question. Typically, you should not call parseParameters() = =20 The reason is parseParameters() is a computation intensive method - you = will take a solid scalability hit if your tag keeps calling it for = parsing the table. The parsing should be done only once, and the table = created is maintained in the tag object. You can get the table too if = you wish by : HTMLTag.getParsed(). Coming to the case of the key - it is ALWAYS converted to UPPERCASE by = parseParameters(). This allows you to forget about case issues and deal = with parameters uniformly. Regards, Somik</body>

    <date>Thu Aug 01 02:33:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>I am evaluating the HTMLParser for suitability in my project. I have gone through the Javadocs and observed that there is support only for some tags. For example IMAGE, LINK, SCRIPT etc. I wanted to know that suppose I want to support another tag say &amp;lt;INPUT&amp;gt; will I need to write my own tag-scanner pair? And if I need to write it how do I do it? You could do it in two ways -=20 [1] Handle it directly at in your application - like this : // Its an input tag // Your code here // The conditional above can be made more robust.. [2] Write your own scanner-tag pair. This is very easy for the input = tag, as no additional parsing is needed. Have a HTMLInputTagScanner = extends HTMLTagScanner. Implement evaluate() - when should this tag = scanner activate ? i.e. when the string contains INPUT in a certain = location (first location). The HTMLTagScanner has some utility methods, = like absorbLeadingBlanks()  - which you should do to make the checkign = simpler and more robust. The scan method is given control when you are evaluate has returned = true. You have to create an object of type HTMLInputTag (extends = HTMLTag), and this is really very simple. Not much in your tag changes, = so use the interface to extract data and create the input tag object. To = see how easy this can be, look at HTMLMetaTagScanner. Finally, make sure that you dont have HTMLFormScanner registered. = Because, HTMLFormScanner automatically picks up the Input tags. = Actually, we have taken out HTMLFormScanner from the default registry, = because its very hard to auto-correct a complete form block - we dont = know how to predict when a form has ended. So this shouldnt be a problem = at all for you. The class is just there for people who need to parse = forms (some of the users of the parser are using it). Cheers, Somik</body>

    <body>The following bug only occurs if JavaScript is written within HTML comment tags. The same comment written outside of JavaScript comment tags works fine. One more parsing bug that we have come across and I'd like to report. If I have a tag as follows &amp;lt;TEXTAREA name="JohnDoe" &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/TEXTAREA&amp;gt; (Note the space before the closing '&amp;gt;' of TEXTAREA tag). On reproduction using toHTML() of TEXTAREA I get the following I think this might have been introduced with the fix which took names without values and assigned blank strings to them.

    <body>Hello anyone.. Im using this parser on a research project. Im building a browser in java, using JEditorPane as the panel that displays the html on the websites. I have succeeded in doing that. The next step was to parse the links on the website and we came across this parser, anyway, i set up the kizna classes and i used this piece of code: //this is in the actionPerformed function, when you press the "GO" Button when i run the browser with say, amazon.com, this is the result i get: ***************************************************** Address : http://www.amazon.com tagContents: a href=" http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/ref=wt_404page/ " Link Tag is http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/ref=wt_404page/ tagContents: table border=0 align=center cellpadding=4 tagContents: a href=" http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/ref=404page/ " Link Tag is http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/ref=404page/ ***********************************88 when i checked the link tag, its redirects to the amazon home page.

    <body>Hi Joe, In the HTMLParser, all the tags are printed on new lines. So the output that you are gettign is expected output. We ahve discussed this problem on the list.  can probably check it out fromt he archives. But more importantly, the HTMLParser is changing the HTML file given to it which it must not do (whethrr it is a browser bug or not should be immaterial to the parser). i.e. input and output of parser must match specially in the presentation aspects. I too think something should be done about it. What do u say Somik?

Then we can walk through the parsed code and print all other tags without newlines, and the newline tag would then be printed to output as a newline.

    <body>Hi Folks, I am on the road now, in Singapore.. I will be travelling the next 2 weeks, so I cannot be regular with mails till then. Dhaval and Joe --&amp;gt; Indeed, I understand the issue, that sometimes things get messed up. But storing all newlines would make the parser a whole lot more complex than it is right now. I am however open to examining it - when I find some time (from October). This does not stop anyone from doing an anlysis and see what can be done. That would  be a good contribution for the community. So pls go ahead-  and let us know what you think.

    <body>Hi Folks, Integration release 1.2-20021016 is out. You can get it from http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net Here's the change log : Integration Build 1.2 - 20021016 -------------------------------- [1] Fixed bug 621117 - JSP tags not recognized if within string node [2] Fixed bug 617228 - Links with &amp;gt; symbol in query strings were not being recognized. [3] build.xml completely automatic - no manual changes needed before running [4] build.xml included in release package, inside src.zip [5] Refactored HTMLTag - design modified, introduced HTMLTagParser helper class [6] Optimized scanning process - 20% faster now There have been some refactorings and optimizations in this release. Most notably, the scanners are not enumerated sequentially anymore. Instead, they are stored inside hashtables, and are identified by the first word that occurs in a tag (in uppercase).  Now, we have a default implementation of evaluate() which returns true, and most of the scanners dont override this if their evaluation is simply based on matching the first word. However, if the matching logic is complex, then evaluate() should be overridden. An additional method has been introduced in HTMLTagScanner() which all scanners have to override - and that is - getID() - which will be used to register the scanner into the hashtable (called only once) inside addScanner(). In addition feedback is being incorporated - you will find feedback if you run the testcases. The performance improvement is substantial - on running com.kizna.htmlTests.PerformanceTest.java - I could see a reduction of 500 ms (with all scanners registered) from 2500 ms to 2000 ms (run on the MySQL installation guide page). For developers (or folks who want to join) - the build script has been included in the distribution (it is a whole lot more powerful now - autodetects code version, etc..). Making your package ready for distribution is exceedingly simple now - so do go ahead and explore. Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Oh :) I was referring to the bug report on asp tags.. Almost done now. Working on powerful build scripts now which should be a part of the next release as well. Bytway, I was thinking on one last design optimization - replacing the scan-evaluate mechanism with a hashtable, so as to reduce the scanner search from O(n) to O(1). I was thinking of doing a basic match initially to spark off a call to the relevant scan for confirmation. What do you think ?

    <body>Hi Claude, So that bug report on the site was yours... The bug has been reproduced and fixed (asp tags inside string nodes not being detected). Should be out in the next release. Regards, Somik Sent: Monday, September 30, 2002 10:17 PM Subject: [Htmlparser-user] Question I've see the parser throw an exception on ASP pages. Strictly speaking, it isn't a requirement that JSP or ASP be parsable, but I think the only hangup is really a failure to recognize the "&amp;lt;% ... %&amp;gt;" pattern. Is this functionality that should be there or would be easy to add? ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Htmlparser-user mailing list Htmlparser-user@... https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/htmlparser-user</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Re: Deletion of code with HTML comments</header>
    <date>Tue Oct 15 08:09:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi , This is in response to the bug report (by nobody) : "If there are some special characters(we found a problem=20 with &amp;lt;) within HTML comments then all lines upto that=20 line(on which the charcter is present) gets deleted=20 when you reprint the tag(using toHTML()). I have been=20 using Node.toHTML() and I am assuming that the tag will=20 get parsed as a HTMLRemarkNode and its toHTML() will=20 get called. Whatever the case the output is distinctly=20 different from the input. Even the starting HTML=20 comments i.e. &amp;lt;!-- get deleted. " ** End of Report I couldnt reproduce this. Make sure you are using the latest Integration = release. HTMLRemarkNodeTest.testTagWithinRemarkNode() checks for this = bug - and it is passing. Also pls dont submit reports as nobody - then = the response wouldnt reach you. Regards, Somik</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Integration Release v1.2-2002_10_02 is out</header>
    <date>Wed Oct 02 03:37:00 CEST 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, I decided to make an early release as I am going to hit the road yet again from tomorrow.. Here's the change log for you.. Integration Build 1.2 - 20021002 -------------------------------- [1] Bug fixed in HTMLStyleScanner, allowing attributes to show in style tag [2] HTMLFormTag bug fixed - allows changing of internal form attributes, and is reflected in toHTML() [3] HTMLFormScanner included in lineup of standard scanners [4] Added default parser feedback object constructor in HTMLParser [5] Only single LinkProcessor object created now for link and image scanners - leading to better performance [6] Added Base Ref Scanner - relative links to this can be handled for both standard links and image locations As you can see- all of this is based on community feedback - so pls keep the feedback coming. Im sorry for the delay in releases- I was swamped - just resigned from my job, and am on vacation for a while. I should be able to continue work on the parser from the 12th - in the meanwhile, if anyone else wishes to work on adding stuff -pls feel free. Areas of work left for production release 1.2 : [1] Checking testcases on Linux - Can someone just run com.kizna.html.AllTests - and give us a report of all the tests that failed ? [2] Checking bug reports from Joe Ryburn on the user group "A linkScanner issue" and Stephen Harrington "Problem Parsing a link" [3] Adding functionality for the parser feedback object - we've got to give some feedback for the logs, etc.. These are simple changes - I hope we can have some help.. Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi Navid, The text doc is outdated (it will be updated for the next release). You can refer to the javadoc - it is uptodate, and is intensive. Check the javadoc of HTMLParser.java to get started. You should keep htmlparser.jar in your classpath (this is in the lib directory), and import com.kizna.html.* in your program. Feel free to put your questions here.

    <body>Hi Navid, Looks like you're having basic java problems here. Whichever class you use, you should have corresponding packages imported. If you're using an intelligent IDE like Eclipse( http://www.eclipse.org ), this is usually auto-detected (when you choose Arrange Imports). One way of cross-checking is - open up the jar file to see that the class or classes you're trying to import exists. In any case, post the program that you're trying to compile, with the entire errors that are thrown, and we might be able to help. Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi Somik, I could do some parts of my program. And the result was great. Thanks for all your helps. But yesterday I found a bug, or most probably it is my mistake. I used the sample in HTMLParser.java * The above snippet will print out only the text * Here's another snippet that will only print out the link urls in a document. * This is an example of adding a link scanner. * HTMLParser parser = new HTMLParser(" http://www.yahoo.com * for (Enumeration e = *  @see HTMLParser#elements() It extract all urls of a page. But if the page url be something like http://www.mysite.com/books/some.asp and for example page has a link as href="newpage.html" then the extracted url will be: http://www.mysite.com/books/some.asp/newpage.html which is wrong! only if the instead some.asp I have some.html then the url will be correct! http://www.mysite.com/books/newpage.html Would you please give me some guide line.

Simply check out the latest snapshot from CVS, and run the build.xml file (using ant). The latest build will be at your disposal. If this is too complex, let me know.. I can make a build specifically for you, but only if u have cvs problems.

How can I skip this, my program reads all urls of a site and tries to go to next page, and if the url does not exist or is wrong, it terminats, I think I should control this in order to let the program carry on on correct links. Thanks for your help. Have a nice weekend. By the way, Are you living in San Francisco? I am in LosAngeles.

    <body>Hi Steve, This is bcos, when you create the HTMLParser object, the io connections are established, and the elements that you run through also advances the internal cursor. A quick solution for you is to re-create the parser object. However, it would be good to support multiple (sequential) iterators. Do you have time to look into the source ? You will need to only work with HTMLParser.java. We would be glad to put this in for the production release. Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi Navid, Here's an easy way to do it. Get the IDE Eclipse. That has inbuilt CVS integration, so all you have to do is specify your repository (Go in anonymous pserver mode). Honestly speaking, I do not know why you were using putty. It is not required at all. I think you might be making a simple mistake- what is the command you are issuing to cvs for checking out code ? Remember, you should be trying anonymous pserver, and not the developer mode.

    <body>Hi Navid, CVS is not running on Eclipse. Eclipse supports CVS through a plugin. There is no connection b/w Ant and CVS. Ant is a build mechanism (have you read the docs on http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/ ?) Eclipse also supports ant. Simply right-click on build.xml, and choose Run Ant. That should create the release in the distribution directory. The check under your eclipse workspace, and navigate to the directory (or if its easier for you, do a search for zip files in windows titled htmlparser* ). Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi Navid, Im really sorry - these questions don't belong on the htmlparser list - you should be asking eclipse questions on the newsgroup (check http://www.eclipse.org ) - they are very responsive, and your questions will get archived in their system, helping other eclipse newbies as well, just as htmlparser questions get archived in this list. Eclipse comes with a lot of quality documentation (in the Help menu). Well - you've got to check out the project. Right Click, and choose Check out As. The choose java project. Then, give a name to your project, and create a source folder (add new folders). It will prompt you for bin, and you can accept that. Once its checked out, you will see the build.xml in your workspace. Right-click here and you should be able to run it. The best suggestion from me is - get on the ant mailing list - post after you've checked the docs and the mailing list archives. The same goes for eclipse. Feel free to post htmlparser related questions on this list. Regards, Somik __________________________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo! Mail Plus - Powerful. Affordable.

    <date>Thu Dec 26 09:32:00 CET 2002</date>
    <body>Hi, I agree with Sam when he says that "don't fix it when its not broken". But at the same time I see the need to make code better, more readable and simpler. However as suggested below it seems that the Visitor pattern is going to make things difficult to understand. And I too like Sam had a problem with HTMLParser initially. It may be with the documentation but this whole tag-scanner things was extremely confusing in the beginning(though subsequently I have loved them so much that I have even written a few myself without any problem). Hence I think that even if the visitor pattern is used, the user must have some simple easy-to-use methods to get his work done rather than try to understand the Visitor pattern. Just like Same, this was my two cents. Cheers, Dhaval -----Original Message----- From: gaijin [mailto:gaijin@...] Sent: Tuesday, December 24, 2002 12:21 PM To: htmlparser-developer Cc: gaijin; htmlparser-user Subject: Re: [Htmlparser-developer] toPlainTextString() feedback requested Hi Somik and Joshua Joshua Kerievsky wrote: the the information and easier case, The Visitor pattern sounds interesting, and I look forward to hearing more about it.  However, duplicated code itself is not IMO necessarily an evil. It all depends on whether one thinks that the duplicated components are going to diverge in functionality in the future.  If you are sure they are not, then fine, refactor away. I guess my surprise at your (or perhaps Somik's) focus on refactoring comes from the fact that while the htmlparser is a great piece of software, the javadocs and other documentation could use some attention. For example, I can't find any explanation in the javadocs or otherwise of how the filters are supposed to work with the different scanners, or what values they are allowed to take. I generally work to "if it's not broken don't fix it", but I often add "before you start fixing it, make sure your documentation is up to date". Using the Visitor pattern may make it easier for clients to get the data they need, but given that the htmlparser is "working" (well it works for me), I would say that the more urgent issue here is making sure all the documentation is up to date.   I have a lot of positive things to say about htmlparser, so don't take it the wrong way, when I say that the biggest problem I've had in using it in the last few weeks is inadequate javadocs. As I mention above.  One should be careful of duplication removal for the sake of it. This is a good reason.  However I get the feeling that introduction of these Visitor classes will make the system conceptually more difficult to use rather than easier.  I would feel better if the current set up was more fully documented before more complexity was added. And even if the Visitor pattern is used, I would recommend leaving methods like toPlainTextString() etc in place, but just making them short cut implementations to certain kinds of visitor-using methods. This will allow people who have yet to grasp the Visitor  pattern something to work with. If you are keen to see lots of people using htmlparser, I think that you don't want people to have to come to terms with too many new concepts at once.  You say yourself that the Visitor pattern takes some getting used to.  I think the whole scanner concept takes some getting used to .... interfaces of when less well I would agree if you could guarantee that there will be no divergence whatsoever in how the different methods will be used.  If you can create a flexible enough implementation of the Visitor pattern then I guess that will support any possible divergence in the separate methods. However, I think there is a reason to have a fatter interface, in that convenience methods lower the barrier to entry for new users. Perhaps ideally one has a well implemented Visitor pattern that supports a raw method access, and a number of convenience methods? A well implemented Visitor pattern will, I assume, support all sorts of different operations, but I would feel much happier if the htmlparser had a complete javadoc and documentation review before any refactoring took place.  People are trying to use the existing system and having trouble not because of the lack of refactoring, but a lack of well described methods.  Well I say people, I mean me, I don't know if anyone else feels the same.  Maybe it's just me :-) Just my two cents.

    <date>Tue Dec 24 02:20:00 CET 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, We are performing a series of refactorings, which will involve merging of the functionality of toPlainTextString() and toHTML(HTMLRenderer), and perhaps, toHTML() itself.. We'd like to know user stories of how you've been using toPlainTextString(). Do you enumerate through the nodes and : [1] collect all the text data using toPlainTextString() into a buffer? [2] make calls to toPlainTextString() but don't collect the data ? [3] collect all text data using toPlainTextString() into a buffer, but only after having processed the string in some way ? Another question - if we remove toPlainTextString() [and provide you an alternative], will it hurt, or would you prefer a deprecation step (in 1.3) before removal (in 1.4) ? It would be good for us to know more details about your applications, so that we can perform our design modifications correctly. Feel free to tell us your stories in detail.

    <body>Hi Somik, I tend to use toPlainTextString() in all three ways described below.  I use the first to generate a plain test overview, the second for debugging statements, and the final one for when I want to add my own additional formatting to the final text. Could you explain why you want to refactor these methods?  Remember the danger of premature refactoring ... you lose flexibility that then has to be re-added later on, making more work in the long run. Is there some efficiency reason why you want to refactor these methods or is it just for neatness? Either way, I would certainly recommend a deprecation step.

    <body>Hi Sam, There seems to be so much duplication in the parser, that it seems like Merciless_Refactoring can alone help clean the code. Readability and efficiency are important factors - far more important is to have a simple way of getting data from the parser. The idea is to pass in your own visitors into the parser, which could either extract text, or html. If you need to modify them, then you can modify these visitors to customize behaviour. The weight of the parser would reduce, code duplication would not be there, and it would be easier to customize. Will keep that in mind.

    <body>&amp;gt; Could you explain why you want to refactor these methods?  Remember the Hi Sam, There's a good deal of duplicate code in way the two toHTML methods and the toPlainTextString method do their work.  The central theme is information accumulation/alteration.  That involves outputing tag and node results and recusing through tags.  The refactoring to Visitor allows us to * remove many lines of duplicate code, spread across many classes * remove hard-coded accumulation/alteration logic, thereby making it easier for clients to get the data they need Visitor takes some getting used to.  I rarely use the pattern. In this case, IMO, it was a good fit. Duplication removal is reason #1.  Removal of hard-coded logic is reason #2. Simplicity is reason #3: there is little reason to fatten the interfaces of tag and node classes with various data accumulation/alteration methods when one method and a variety of concrete Visitors can do the job with much less code. best regards jk</body>

    <body>Hi Somik and Joshua Joshua Kerievsky wrote: The Visitor pattern sounds interesting, and I look forward to hearing more about it.  However, duplicated code itself is not IMO necessarily an evil. It all depends on whether one thinks that the duplicated components are going to diverge in functionality in the future.  If you are sure they are not, then fine, refactor away. I guess my surprise at your (or perhaps Somik's) focus on refactoring comes from the fact that while the htmlparser is a great piece of software, the javadocs and other documentation could use some attention. For example, I can't find any explanation in the javadocs or otherwise of how the filters are supposed to work with the different scanners, or what values they are allowed to take. I generally work to "if it's not broken don't fix it", but I often add "before you start fixing it, make sure your documentation is up to date". Using the Visitor pattern may make it easier for clients to get the data they need, but given that the htmlparser is "working" (well it works for me), I would say that the more urgent issue here is making sure all the documentation is up to date.   I have a lot of positive things to say about htmlparser, so don't take it the wrong way, when I say that the biggest problem I've had in using it in the last few weeks is inadequate javadocs. As I mention above.  One should be careful of duplication removal for the sake of it. This is a good reason.  However I get the feeling that introduction of these Visitor classes will make the system conceptually more difficult to use rather than easier.  I would feel better if the current set up was more fully documented before more complexity was added. And even if the Visitor pattern is used, I would recommend leaving methods like toPlainTextString() etc in place, but just making them short cut implementations to certain kinds of visitor-using methods. This will allow people who have yet to grasp the Visitor  pattern something to work with. If you are keen to see lots of people using htmlparser, I think that you don't want people to have to come to terms with too many new concepts at once.  You say yourself that the Visitor pattern takes some getting used to.  I think the whole scanner concept takes some getting used to .... well I would agree if you could guarantee that there will be no divergence whatsoever in how the different methods will be used.  If you can create a flexible enough implementation of the Visitor pattern then I guess that will support any possible divergence in the separate methods. However, I think there is a reason to have a fatter interface, in that convenience methods lower the barrier to entry for new users. Perhaps ideally one has a well implemented Visitor pattern that supports a raw method access, and a number of convenience methods? A well implemented Visitor pattern will, I assume, support all sorts of different operations, but I would feel much happier if the htmlparser had a complete javadoc and documentation review before any refactoring took place.  People are trying to use the existing system and having trouble not because of the lack of refactoring, but a lack of well described methods.  Well I say people, I mean me, I don't know if anyone else feels the same.  Maybe it's just me :-) Just my two cents. CHEERS&amp;gt; SAM</body>

    <body>Hi Sam, The last few weeks, I've been only adding docs... The Sample Programs are new - you will find an example of using filters here : http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/samples/linksEmbedded.html From the javadoc : http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/htmlparser/HTMLNode.html (check collectInto) I guess more javadoc should be written about this, but I didn't bother to write it bcos the filters were mostly used for demonstration from the command line. When you type java -jar htmlparser.jar, you would see a help menu of each filter. Its only with the introduction of Collection Parameter that we've been using filter strings for actual collection of data, and that has been documented. If its not important, its not documented :). Sam - feel free to post as often as you like on the list. I'd be glad to help you out. The lack of adequate documentation is of course my responsibility and in light of my explanation above, if you can suggest other areas of inadequate docs, I'll look into it. Don't worry, we'll leave toPlainTextString() alone - in fact, we've already begun doing the short cut implementations. :) The purpose of my initial mail was not to alarm you, but to know more about realistic "customer" stories. Bytway, have you gone thru the Sample Programs - I should've thought that this new addition will make life very simple. If not, we'd probably need more docs.. Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Sam wrote: At the moment, Somik and I speculate that 40% to 50% of the current html parser code base is pure fat -- unnecessary code that only serves to bloat the code base.  Duplicate code, in subtle or not-so-subtle versions, is mostly responsible for the bloat.  In my experience in industry, I'd say that 95% of the time, duplicate code is bad. The html parser is in sore need of refactoring Sam.  In fact, sometimes code becomes unnecessarily complex, in which case people *really* need documentation.  I confront such a problem by first asking if the code could be simplified so we didn't need so much documentation.   In the event that we do need docs, it is best to write executable documentation.  Are you familiar with executable documentation? Software becomes brittle and bloated under the philosophy of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."   We have clients with code bases that are 2 millions lines of "working" speghetti code.  They need lots of help to learn to do continuous refactoring. I'm not content to live with the world as it is Sam.  If something isn't easy, it's wrong.  The best software in the world is easy to use, it's self-explanatory.  We should always strive for that.  In the meantime, if you have tasks to complete and don't know how to do them because of lack of docs, I'd suggest you ask questions here.  The best result will be executable documentation for the html parser. And as I mentioned above, I completely disagree with you.  I wonder, how much refactoring have you done in your career given you philosophy of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it?"   Have you read Martin Fowler's landmark book, Refactoring?   If not, I'd suggest you study it thoroughly - you'll be a better programmer for it. As I also said above, if it ain't simple, it's wrong.  Our changes will not add complexity - that would be foolish. People can always call deprecated methods. Our Visitor implementation is so trivial that folks won't even know they're using the pattern. of when less Wouldn't it be marvelous if the barrier to entry was low and our code wasn't bloatware? The changes will make the code easier to use - if they don't, they really cool thing about software is that it is soft - we can change it. Executable documentation is a term we use for Customter Tests.   A Customer Tests shows how a body of code gets used to perform real tasks.   You have real-world tasks to perform.  We can perform those tasks via automated tests.   Then, when we refactor, we must make sure our executable documentation is up to date (i.e. it passes its tests).   We find this ideal for making sure that documentation reflects what the code is actually doing. This also leaves room for a document that gives some graphical representation of how things work, which must be maintained by someone, lest it get out of date.  We just minimize the need for such documents by keeping our code simple and small and surrounding it with easy to understand executable documentation. best regards jk</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] HTMLParser 1.2 (Production Release) is out</header>
    <date>Sun Dec 22 03:24:00 CET 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, Finally, after 8 months of hard work, we have the next production release of the parser. 1.2 has tons of bug fixes and features. The change log difference b/w 1.2 and 1.1 is too big to be listed in this mail - check the change log when you are downloading (its also in the download package). Documentation has been considerably improved (the Sample programs would be the place to start). There's a section on the patterns in action as well. You can modify the rendering process for links and images, as well as provide collecting parameters to pick up nodes that you wish (currently images and links supported). Below is the change log (as compared to last week's integration release) : Production Release 1.2 ---------------------- [1] Rewrote HTMLLinkProcessor.extract() so URL class does all the heavy lifting [2] Partially fixed bug 654746 - HTMLLinkScanner error, code review needed [3] Rendering bug fixed - allowing uniform rendering for links and images [4] Fixed bug 655917, made HTMLParameterParser.parseParameters() thread-safe [5] Refactored HTMLFormTag (introduced POST and GET static members) [6] Bug fixed in HTMLFormTag.getInputTag() (NullPointerException when input tag has no name) [7] Added ability to get textarea tag from HTMLFormTag. [8] Added search capability in HTMLFormTag [9] Fixed bug 655627 - JSP tags with &amp;lt; sign (for loops) were not being parsed correctly [10] Fixed bug 655603 - JSP tags within src of script not recognized correctly when using single apostrophes [11] Fixed bug 655580 - JSP tags within title tags not recognized correctly [12] Fixed bug 655599 - Erroneous end-of-line characters were being added in string nodes [13] Fixed bug 656870 - HTMLFormScanner goes into infinite loop if a previous link has not been closed Thanks to Derrick Oswald and Dhaval Udani for their work on the last few releases. Thanks to Joe Robins for pointing out an important bug in HTMLFormScanner. A special mention for Dhaval - all his bug reports come with testcases making it really easy for us to reproduce the bug and fix them. Regards, Somik</body>

From the Change Log : Integration Build 1.2 - 20021215 -------------------------------- [1] Modified API of HTMLImageTag (refactored name of image loc), HTMLLinkTag (added getters) [2] Fixed bug 650457 - removeEscapeCharacters() incorrect [3] Fixed bug 652263 - HTMLParser and null feedback [4] Changed encoding used from 8859_4 to 8859_1 [5] HTMLRemarkNode returns string data in toPlainTextString() (This is a rollback) [6] Fixed bug 652746 - HTMLFormTag gets links correctly now [7] Fixed bug 653720 - HTMLNode uses sun specific class [8] Improved StringExtractor parser application [9] Major design improvement, implemented Collection-Parameter pattern - in HTMLNode.collectInto() [10] Fixed reset crash bug. Reader providers have to explicitly call mark and reset now. This is now documented in HTMLParser.java. [11] Fixed bug 649269 in HTMLLinkTag.isHttpLink(), now correctly identifies relative links as Http links. A major API improvement has occurred - HTMLNode now has a new method - collectInto(), which uses a collection parameter to collect nodes. A sample program demonstrating this feature is at : http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/samples/linksEmbedded.html Thanks to everyone who participated in the discussions and architecture changes. There has been a rollback as well, we've taken out the mark and reset mechanism, and this is now the responsibility of the reader supplier. Cheers, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi Folks, This week's release is Candidate 5. We've had talented developers joining us over the weekend, hence, you can expect improvements in quality in the coming weeks. Hopefully, we should have our production release ready by New Year's... From the change log : Integration Build 1.2 - 20021208 --------------------------------- [1] Fixed bug in base href scanner - would always expect href [2] Refactored HTMLFormScanner [3] Refactored HTMLRenderer to use the Visitor pattern- enabling connections with links and images [4] HTMLStringNode returns a blank string in toPlainTextString() [5] HTMLFormTag returns string information in toPlainTextString() #5 is an important fix as now, we wont lose any meaningful string info contained inside forms when we issue calls like node.toPlainTextString(). Get the latest release from http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net The site update is continuing at an even pace. There is a new section on writing tests for HTMLParser. We're also trying to introduce a philosophy called "Communicate with TestCases". If you've found a bug, write a testcase for it, and submit that in your report. Of course, you dont have to do this, but if you do, we'd be able to make the fix much faster (and motivated to make the fix). Writing a testcase for the parser is super simple - you can check the philosophy and an example on the documentation page. http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/design/index.html Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>actually, there are two problems in the case at hand, and i am not at all sure that the &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt; construction is the worst of them. not only does hotbot produce this invalid sequence, but they also failed to close the form tag.  it looks like HTMLFormScanner simply falls out of the loop at lines 136-154 looking for the end tag and throws an exception when not found. it would be better if the end-form tag could be 'assumed' so that the file could at least be parsed.  that would mirror the behavior of commercial browsers.

    <body>Hi Leslie, Indeed, the &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; tag is a nightmare to work with. At one point, we had removed it from the basic set of scanners. We put it back in after our exception handling mechanism was in place - so now, if things get messy, you should get an exception. We can't possibly handle every bit of screwed html :), although we try really hard to. commercial I had spent some time on this, tried it and failed miserably. It turned out to be almost impossible to predict where a form tag should end, bcos of its expanse, and particularly bcos of its intermingling with &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;. Its quite possible I missed something - so if you have any innovative suggestions, it would be really helpful. I think we're dealing on the realm of AI here :). Remember, there is a big constraint, we have a streaming, real-time parser and not a DOM style parser where we have all of it and can go back and forth. A good heuristic that really works will make our day. Bytway, maybe this discussion could better happen on the dev list.. Feel free to join us as a dev (send me your sourceforge id).

    <body>Navid, You can easily get around this problem by removing the HTMLFormScanner from the scan list. The HTMLFormScanner is automatically registered when u use HTMLParser.registerScanners(). Use the removeScanner function to remove this scanner and then proceed with your code.

    <date>Mon Dec 02 02:56:00 CET 2002</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, Candidate Release 4 is out. This actually contains a few minor API = changes which wont affect your application, but have been done to = improve the OO design of the system. HTMLFormScanner has been improved. = The major work in this release went in refactoring 201 testcases - so as = to make it more readable, and follow the Once-And-Only-Once paradigm. = Well, the package size dropped about 12KB (after zipping), so you can = estimate how much refactoring was done.. All tests are passing. From the Change Log,=20 Integration Build 1.2 - 20021201 -------------------------------- [1] Refactored HTMLNode, API improved, now HTMLNode stores nodeBegin and nodeEnd. [2] Refactored Testing framework - to reduce the code size = substantially. [3] HTMLFormScanner improved to include Input,TextArea, Select and = Option scanners within You can get it from http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net There's an all-new Contributors Page (linked from the main site). Just = in case I missed anybody, or you have info to add, pls let me know. Regards, Somik</body>

So I found this HTMLParser on sourceforge  and  I  hope it can help me  to develop  HTML translation module.

    <body>&amp;gt; What I want to do is to parse HTML code and By translating content, I guess you mean translation of meaningful text data (not tags). That is easily possible. You can look at the StringExtractor example (org.htmlparser.parserapplications) or the StringFindingVisitor (org.htmlparser.visitors). The simplest approach is to write your own visitor - StringTranslatingVisitor, that runs through the entire html, and wherever it finds strings, these are translated as per your wishes. Here is a sample program : public class StringTranslatingVisitor extends public void visitStringNode(HTMLStringNode // Perform modifications here. // finally, add to htmlData public void visitRemarkNode(HTMLRemarkNode To use this, create your parser - HTMLParser parser = new HTMLParser(" http://someurl.com StringTranslatingVisitor visitor = Regards, Somik __________________________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

    <body>Hi Folks, The next integration release is out. From the change log : Integration build 1.3 - 20030125 -------------------------------- [1] HTMLCompositeTagScanner now takes an array of match strings [2] toHTML(HTMLRenderer ...) was replaced by UrlModifyingVisitor [3] Fixed NullPointerException in HTMLScriptTag.toString() [4] Fixed bug in HTMLStringNode (breaking up empty lines into seperate string nodes) [5] Fixed thread safety issue and introduced parser helpers [6] Fixed bug 664404 - spewing incorrect line breaks in HTMLRemarkNode.toHTML() [7] Added assertXmlEquals() in HTMLParserTestCase [8] Added better option tag support [9] Replaced instanceof with getType() mechanism - much faster [10] Incorporated NodeList instead of Vector in HTMLCompositeTag [11] Added HTMLRemarkNode support in Visitor [12] Fixed bug 673379 (infinite loop on encountering links like ".someurl.html") Among the notable additions is assertXmlEquals() - this is present to enable us to perform xml testing. This method actually creates the parser and performs a node for node comparison. Reconstruction has improved a lot - you will find that the parser now does not add unnecessary line breaks - and preserves the html as it came in. One significant addition is the use of NodeList instead of Vector. The integration has been performed, so there should be a significant performance increase - check http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/performance/simpleEnumerationPerformance.h tml In the coming week, we will be setting up a wiki on sourceforge, where we can collaboratively create documentation - hopefully that will finally take the burden out of the documentation process.

    <date>Sat Jan 25 18:48:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>&amp;gt; I came across this interesting tool for parsing HTML There aer some good SAX parsers out there - but they are for parsing XML, not HTML. HTMLParser is primarily a tool for parsing HTML - and HTML is usually dirty, with no end tags, etc. Of late, we have started using HTMLParser to parse XML, and it is useful as it is so compact and very fast. However, keep in mind that HTMLParser is a tolerating parser. It cannot tell you if your xml file has errors (at least not yet) which most SAX parsers do. HTML files primarily. Lots of folks use it in their search engines, crawlers.. I use it for unit testing html (actually unit testing xsl stylesheets) for web applications at my workplace. http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net - there is a download link. You are advised to go with an integration release, as HTMLParser is a 100% tested project. We do not add new bugs with every new release (we try not to and succeed to a good extent). Remove the package name if you are compiling it as your application. Bytway, this is already present in the parser, so when you download it, you shouldn't face any problems. Regards, Somik</body>

It is simple to use the parser to pick up tags that you want which are not already covered by the scanners. Here is what a sample program would look like. HTMLParser parser = HTMLParser.createParser( "&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html:something&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;bean:some bean tag&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;" // Replace above with the line below as per your requirements // HTMLParser parser = new HTMLParser(" http://www.yahoo.com if (tag.getText().indexOf("html:")!=-1 || tag.getText().indexOf("bean:")!=-1)</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Integration Release 1.3-20020112 is out</header>
    <date>Mon Jan 13 04:50:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, This week's integration release is out. This release has significant contributions from Derrick Oswald and Josh Kerievsky. Derrick is building a nice UI for the parser - and making tons of improvements. Thanks to Josh's insight, we have done some major refactorings on the scanners - resulting in a massive drop in code duplication. Here are some statistics - the scanners package in the last release had 1693 lines of code. In the current release, this has dropped to 1300 lines of code. We have a new class HTMLCompositeTagScanner which does the hard-work for picking up child tags. Most scanners use this code. HTMLTagScanner too does some useful work-  and from this release, new scanners dont need to override evaluate() or scan(). Take a look at the refactored scanner code and you might be surprised with its size and simplicity. Here's the change log : Integration build 1.3 - 20030112 -------------------------------- [1] Assume charset is correct for JVM's without Charset class to check it [2] Beanize the parser [3] Switch to swingui junit runner by default [4] Half baked beans [5] Fix javadoc warnings in JDK 1.4 [6] Added StringFindingVisitor + test code + new visitors packages [7] Fixed bug 659723, but HTMLStringNode is not thread-safe anymore. [8] JDK 1.2 compilability [9] Modified HTMLEnumeration interface (made less verbose) [10] Added HTMLCompositeTagScanner [11] Refactored following scanners to use HTMLCompositeTagScanner : (i) HTMLStyleScnner (ii) HTMLSelectScanner (iii) HTMLFrameSetScanner (iv) HTMLTitleScanner (v) HTMLTextAreaScanner (vi) HTMLScriptScanner (vii) HTMLFrameSetScanner [12] Made StringNode the last parse attempt, so now Reader trys in this order: remark tag endtag string (this will return more HTMLStringNode objects than it did before). [13] Improve speed by performing tag/string triage based on '&amp;lt;' as next character. [14] Refactored HTMLTagScanner. The following scanners use refactored code: (i) HTMLBaseHREFScanner (ii) HTMLDoctypeScanner (iii) HTMLFrameScanner (iv) HTMLJspScanner (v) HTMLMetaTagScanner Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Ash, For your requirement of reading the entire HTML and storing it on disk in an identical format, I suggest that you not use the HTMLParser. I suggest that u do it onyour own using readers and writers for the present. The changes suggested by you are quite good. However as far as the toHTML() method is concerned it does not exactly throw replicate the input HTML. So if you are using it to do that you are better off with the approach given above. However for parsing HTML, this parser is great not only because it works beautifully, but because it is so easy to use as described by Somik below but also because you can switch off and switch on the parsers as required.

Of course, there is another option of taking a String file name argument, but the user may want to specify the file encoding as well (as is the case with me). So the java.io.Writer is a better option. This should not take much time to implement, as you just need to check if the writer has been supplied and once you read a line using the readLine() method in HTMLReader, write this string to the writer using the println method and call flush().

    <body>Hi, Seems like I will have to do that for now. But this also means that I will have to read the stream twice (huge performance cost) because I also need to parse the html for form elements as mentioned in my previous mail. I have searched for libraries which will allow me to do all this in one step and HTMLParser is the closest I got which meets my requirements. I really hope that my suggestions are taken.

    <body>Hi All, I am new to html parser. I am working on a project which needs quite a bit of html parsing. I have an inputstream and this is what I need to do with it: 1) read the stream and save the entire response to disk. 2) While reading, parse the contents and extract links and form elements from it. 3) search the response for a particular string. Also, suppose that the response is not html, it is plain text maybe, would it still be possible to search the response for some string? What is the most efficient way to do this? I am looking for an all-in-one-step approach. I went through the docs but am not sure whether I need to write custom HtmlRenderers and scanners. Please help. Another question is that has HtmlParser been tested with Unicode content, for example Korean or Chinese characters? In other words, does HtmlParser support Unicode? This question is in relation to the point no.3 mentioned above. Regards, Ash. P.S. A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYBODY. ________________________________________________________________________ Missed your favourite TV serial last night? Try the new, Yahoo!

    <body>Hmm.. Check the Sample Programs on the website http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net . That should help you understand the parser and get started. The sample programs are also in the download bundle of the parser. You can use toHTML() to do this.. for (HTMLEnumeration e = Check sample programs for links. Form elements is much the same as there is an HTMLFormTag. So all you need to do is : Sure. There are methods like toPlainTextString(), which get the string output of a node. Then there is HTMLStringNode - that represents a pure string node. You dont. Start with the sample programs, and post here if you need help. Yes - I think you should not have a problem.

    <body>Hi, I was looking into the example code provided with the 1.3 version distribution regrading extracting embedded links/images. I notice that I would have to specify a class filter in the collectInto method of Node class. Suppose that I want to collect several types of embedded tags in the same call, this method won't allow me to do so. Is it possible that I pass a Class[] type as the filter to this method? Anoter question regarding the collectInto(NodeList collectionList, java.lang.String filter) method, I could not seem to find the filter constants for different Node type. Can anyone point me where these are? BTW, I think HTMLParser is a great software. I have being looking for Java html parser high and low. HTMLParser represent a best architecture and user API to me. I especially like that it is in a sense a steaming parser. This means performance and optimal memory usage for me. Thanks. Joe __________________________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!

    <date>Thu Feb 27 02:54:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>If I recall correctly, implementing this feature would require deferring not only the connect but also the determination of the character set (from the header returned by the connect) and creation of the reader (because it needs the character set, and an input stream) until elements() is called.  elements() would need to check for a null reader and do the work. Then getReader() and getEncoding() would also have to handle a null reader or null character_set too. Are there other subtleties? Maybe tricky, but probably do-able.  I think all the constructors have test cases. But then, all that's really being saved is the user coding: Parser parser = new Parser (" http://yadda ...process the url as appropriate ... parser.elements () instead of: URL url = new URL (" http://yadda ...process the url as appropriate ... parser.elements () So it's probably not really worth the convoluted coding, unless I'm missing something in the use-case.

    <body>Hi, I tried this, as you suggested, and received the same Exception while reading the InputStream.  Which led me to discover that I was setting the wrong character set in the InputStreamReader. My app was erroneously using the system default character set (UTF8 in this case), but the actual stream was using  ISO-8859-1. The getCharset and getCharacterSet methods in Parser are very useful here.  You may want to consider making them static and public, or moving them to a Utility class.  That way they can be used by applications which construct their own Readers.

    <body>Hi, I'm doing my harvester to harvest information in the formtag. It works find when I parse to any html pages that I need to parse except for this URL http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/Quizzes/misc/earlyadopterjxta.html . It seems that the page that gives the error does not have an endtag for the formtag and the parser loopback to find the endtag for the formtag. Is this a bug? Do you know a solution that I can still parse the page and still get the Vector FormInput for further processing. Hope you can help me on this. below is the generated error.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Suggestion on Harvester</header>
    <date>Thu Feb 27 00:21:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>hi there, I think a formtag should end when it sees another formtag although it is not an endtag. Another way of determining the endtag of formtag is to check wether it is the end of the html page by checking the endtag of hmtltag. This is because the in formtag, it's consist of inputtag and the importants information about a form is its method, action, and inputtag, therefore when the parser first see a formtag it will parse the node until it sees the endtag of the formtag, another formtag or the end of html document. therefore, we can logically group Vector of inputtag and other attributes to the appropriate formtag (if there is more than one formtag). I hope my explaination can help us improve htmlparser. thank you.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Integration Release 1.3-20030223 is out (API changes)</header>
    <date>Mon Feb 24 06:15:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, This week's release is out. I've finally taken heed of all the feedback I had been receiving about the terrible naming convention, and have removed "HTML" from all class names. In addition, HTMLEnumeration is now NodeIterator and SimpleEnumeration is SimpleNodeIterator. HTMLParser is just Parser. This is a big step, so to make it easy for everyone, there have been no major bug fixes that will require you to upgrade right away. I apologize in advance for inconvenience caused - I hope you don't curse me too much for having to modify your programs. I had the option of doing it in stages, and forcing you to modify some small thing in every release, or get it over with in one sweep. I chose the latter bcos there were too many changes and suffering over a long period of time didn't make sense. Hopefully, once you have migrated to the new names, you will appreciate not having to type "HTML" each time. The BodyScanner contributed by Dhaval Udani is finally in (Dhaval - sorry for the delay). The interesting part is that the documentation accompanying the package is now the latest one on the site - it has been ripped off a Php Wiki. I am thinking that the ripping program might be useful for those who wish to provide wiki content as offline documentation (any feedback on this is welcome). From the change log : Integration build 1.3 - 20030223 -------------------------------- [1] Modification of documentation packaging - the new documentation is actually produced by a tiny program that coverts wiki pages into documentation (works with PhpWiki) [2] Inclusion of BodyScanner, BodyTag [3] HTMLVisitor is now NodeVisitor - and has an extra param to visit itself [4] HTMLParser is now Parser. No class has HTML prefix anymore. [5] HTMLEnumeration is now NodeIterator, SimpleEnumeration is SimpleNodeIterator Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>I was trying to integrate the changes of the latest parser with some existing projects at work - and of course, I had to modify the code to use the new API. I had some suggestions - as I know many of you will be facing the same issue. I use Eclipse, and I hope most of you use a decent IDE that supports refactoring. Get the parser into your IDE, and let all your other project code refer to it (thats how it is setup in my IDE). Then, rename Parser to HTMLParser using your refactoring tool. Rename it back to Parser, and all your existing code will automatically get fixed. Do this for some other classes like HTMLNode/Node, etc.. and within minutes it should be done.

    <body>&amp;gt; I need to get only "Title and snippets(summary)" Write your own visitor. The visitor should override visitTag(). Check if the tag is a HTMLTitleTag, and if it is - you have the title contents. To get snippets, override visitStringNode(), and collect all the string data. To clean them up, use HTMLParserUtils.removeEscapeCharacters(). Check http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php/LinkExtraction (point 3), for an example of writing your own visitor.

    <body>hi, I would like to write a program that can harvest certain information (mostly text) on the web page. Some of the web page requires feedback from the user (existence of &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; tag) to get more information on the page. Some of the page is just a plain text and some of the page is in frames. How can I wrote a single harvester that can harvest these three types of pages with one harvester code. below is the sample pages that I want to harvest. (harvest question and get the correct answers.) i)with the form: http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/Quizzes/jbasics1-1/ ii)plain text: http://www.jchq.net/mockexams/exam3.htm iii) with frames: http://www.angelfire.com/or/abhilash/Main.html hope you can give me some advice on how to do this. thank you.</body>

    <body>You could go thru the docs at http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php/LinkExtraction Forms and Frames are represented by HTMLFormTag, and HTMLFrameTag. You could write your own visitor that could collect form tags, string nodes, and on encountering a frame tag, could open a new parser object for the frame url and visit it with the same visitor (different object probably). Try out the programs on this page, and it should be easy. Feel free to post here if you face any problems.

    <body>Hi, I'm sure somebody else  had asked this before . My program gets HTML code from others website. This is simply could  be done without problem if it is not redirect website. What could I do if it is a redirect website ? It only returns  some META tags. I know that we can analyze META tags but do we  have any other smart solution ? (Maybe there is  an existing module to do this task so I don't have to reinvent the wheel) Any fast and simple solution to this kind of problem ? TQ</body>

    <date>Tue Feb 11 05:30:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hi all, My 2 cents worth on this issue. locations. need a map to.. At this point of time we may not be able to understand different requirements of different applications. As a rule we must not keep anything binding in the parser. Everything should be read/write. Itsupto the user of the API to use it properly. As such we keep seeing new ares where the parser is getting deployed. Alongwith this come new requirements and new unforeseen needs. Its best to keep it open such that anyone can go and change any attribute/tag/node etc. Dhaval</body>

But I'd like to add that I do not agree in general about adding stuff that may or may not be used - that is a code smell by itself (in fact, one of the code smells in Fowler's book talks about unnecessary setter methods). This always adds up to maintenance problems later. To accomodate future needs, I think we need to be agile (I hope we are agile enough for our community). In this situation though, we might save some duplication by allowing the setting of the attribute in HTMLTag, and it might be a good feature to have. Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>Hi, I noticed that some of the Tag classes have a method that permit to modify (or I guess they do) the "source" attribute (like href or src). These methods are, for example : setBaseURL,  setImageURL, setLink... It seems perfect to me, as I have to modify all relative path in a html... but I can't find method that set source location in a frame tag, nor in an input tag (when type=image). What can I do ? Would it be too complex for me if I tried to add such a method in the HTMLFrameTag class ? And for the InputTag class ? Regards, Elodie</body>

    <body>&amp;gt; I thought I had already replied to this - my question I already answered, too, when you asked me to give a scenario. In my case, I work in a portal where you can import any kind of files. The filesystem is so that the "logical paths" are different from the "physical paths" : for example, /my_html_files/index.html is in "real" /rep1024/fic1035.html. So, when you want to visualize HTML files from this portal, the 'href' ans 'src' paths aren't valid anymore, so I must take them all, "translate" them and replace them. And when you use a frame, the src attribute can be to a relative path, so I need to modify it too. I hope I answered convincingly enough ! ;o) Best regards, Elodie</body>

"physical paths" : for example, /my_html_files/index.html is in "real" /rep1024/fic1035.html. 'src' paths aren't valid anymore, so I must take them all, "translate" them and replace them. Yes of course- thats why you are allowed to modify urls and image locations. But of what benefit would it be to remap the form url - bcos you'd need a real server serving your requests - unless you have local server to map to.. I am curious about your scenario for form location modification. I need to modify it too. Yes, I agree this should be allowed. Regards, Somik</body>

This is bcos when you rip pages off, changing the relative image and web links makes sense, but the form link usually refers to a server capable of processing http posts. Making that relative to your local machine makes little sense (at least till now) for a ripping application.

We would be grateful if you could write to us about how you have used the parser (if you are doing a lot of string processing from html). Here are some sample uses we would think are most common : [1] Ripping text content from a web page [2] Transforming string node text We are looking for real-world examples for these scenarios (and any other example which doesent come under the above two categories). Your feedback will help us improve the design of the parser. Thanks for taking the time to reply. Regards, Somik __________________________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!

    <body>Greetings, I checked out the latest CVS version (on 02/04/2003) and saw that the fix was applied for HTMLs that have not double quotes in them. Unfortunately, I found a prior bug showing itself again The HTML below throws an index out of bounds on the word 'hello' -- it dies on the last single quote. // if this fails, output a 'hello' if (true) //something good...

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Integration release 1.3-20030202 is out</header>
    <date>Mon Feb 03 07:21:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, Integration release 1.3-20030202 is out. From the change log : Integration build 1.3 - 20030202 -------------------------------- [1] Renamed HTMLCompositeTagScanner to CompositeTagScanner [2] Renamed HTMLTag.getParameter() to HTMLTag.getAttribute() [3] Added TableScanner [4] Added HtmlPage [5] Added SpanScanner [6] Added assertType in HTMLParserTestCase [7] Added TextExtractingVisitor [8] Added non-recursive visiting (flag in HTMLVisitor) [9] Added DivScanner [10] Modified collectInto to use NodeList [11] Added collectInto(NodeList, Class) [13] Fixed bug 678969 - StringParser was not going into ignore mode on encountering double quotes [14] Added LabelScanner Dhaval Udani has contributed LabelScanner. (He has also contributed a BodyScanner which will make it next week's release). We've shipped this time with two tests failing-  both tests replicate the same bug - 677874 - "mishandling of double quotes". I made this release for two reasons : [1] This bug is not a new addition but was always there - its a deep bug in AttributeParser (previously known as ParameterParser) - and it might take a little time to fix [2] There are lot of new additions which we'd like to get out there - we finally have a table scanner! [3] Important bug fixes have been made which further stabilize the parser's performance (and at least one user was desperately waiting for the fix) Notable addition - HTMLNode.collectInto() has a new mode of operation - using the class type. Suppose you need to get to a node (e.g. images) that is within a composite (like a table), you can do : You can also do this directly from the parser - like so : And here's some more news - we now have our own wiki (finally!). Go to http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/docs/ This is a free-for-all wiki. It is a little too much for me to write the entire documentation on my own - so I'd highly appreciate if the user/developer community pitches in - that would be a great benefit for the community. The current documentation on the site is already obsolete, and I am going to take it down soon (hopefully by the next release). Regards, Somik</body>

    <body>I didnt mean to jump on u or anyone else, or evene complaining. i totaly understand your situation, its same for me, i only have my free time to work on my personal projects. what i meant was that, this kind of bugs, if u can call it a bug, should be easier and faster to fix, but thats only how i see it, it may be more complicated. what i've understand av the source code is that this only happens once, when meta-scanninga starts, and therfore it should be fixed easily to let the meta-tag use different charsets. when i say "stupid bug", i mean it shouldnt be there at all, i can't understand why the designers and developers would consider every page use ISO-charsets, when there are som many of them. but thats just my opinion. i hope u dont missunderstood me about "put everything down and fix the bug" thing, its just i see it as "easy to fix" and really would help me, but thats just my opinion. i've seen a new "Integration Releaset, but what a dissapointment that the cahrset-bug is not fixed! i hope everyone have noticed the bug report for META-charset bug. as i said before, my solution was just temporary and is not a good one of 2 reasons: i dont have enough skills in this matter to come with good solutions, and i hav'nt yet checked through the whole code, as i consider it important to be able to suggest fixes. i hope the bug report is enough to fix the probelm. rezamotori, Sweden -- _______________________________________________ Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</body>

If you're objecting to my request to file a bug report- then pls note that I cannot devote weekdays to the project, only my personal time on weekends. And when I do get the time, I do not prefer to search all emails on the user list to find what bugs need to be tackled. As far as the bug in question being stupid-  all bugs are stupid, its just that one person does not have the time to find them all, and code is often written by more than one person. There are also development priorities - certain bugs take precendence - in my opinion, which I often base on feedback. Since this is not a paid project, you cannot expect me or any other developer to jump on an incomplete bug report - the least we expect is the community to help out. However, if a certain bug hurts you, and needs fixing, you could always make a polite request. Or solve it yourself and give it to the community, for which all of us will be grateful. and enable it to expand for new charsets. just was a temperary fix. Thank you for the suggestion. Perhaps you can give us the patch in question. And just so you don't think I am being sarcastic, I'd be happy to have you on our developer team - anyone who wants to improve the system earns a right to be on the dev team. In general - I think it will be good to have guidelines for posting questions to make us a more effective community.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Major Milestone: Integration Release 1.3-20030316 is out</header>
    <date>Sun Mar 16 21:36:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, This is a major milestone release. A massive refactoring has been completed (took two weeks) - which has brought all the robust error handling cases into CompositeTagScanner. This means, all tags that have children will be able to do error correction uniformly. Form tag (and table tags too) should be robust. Table tags are not yet in the standard set of scanners (you still need to add them manually). They should make the cut next week. We have a new method - registerDomScanners() in Parser - that allows you to build html dom objects. Interesting fact, as a result of the refactorings, the LOC of the scanners package has reduced from 1553 to 1355 (I was surprised at the digits). Documentation has been updated - we've started putting up answers by our list members to common questions. Pls feel free to update the Wiki and improve it. No login is required. From the change log: Integration build 1.3 - 20030316 -------------------------------- [1] Added method finishedParsing() to NodeVisitor [2] LinkScanner uses CompositeTagScanner.scan() [3] BulletScanner added [4] FormScanner uses CompositeTagScanner.scan() [5] AppletScanner uses CompositeTagScanner.scan() We highly recommend an upgrade to this version.

    <body>Guilherme, I think what you need is in src/org/htmlparser/util/Translate.java Something like this should work: If you have to do a lot of it though, you'll probably want to rewrite that method. As it stands it allocates one Character for each character in the input string. If you do want to rewrite it, you should probably instead adjust the Generate class in the same package since the Translate.java source is created by running Generate.

So if you register TableScanner alone, you should be fine. Yes of course. Just make sure that you also call registerScanners(), if you want to pick up image tags within the td.

I've tried creating a URL from the string and trying to use a HTMLReader or Reader to get at the information.

If there is no endtag of formtag, the parser should know when it ends when it sees another formtag. if there is no another formtag in the html page, just parse it till it sees the end of the html code. thanks.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Node object and line number</header>
    <date>Wed Mar 12 19:15:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hello, I just thought I'd start out by thanking everyone who has worked on the = htmlparser project.  I'm been using it for only a few days now but the = functionality it provides has saved me amazing amounts of work.  So far = I have found it very easy to integrate into my project. I am using the htmlparser library for what I'm guessing is a less = traditional application.  I've integrated it into a custom servlet = filter which takes a processed JSP page and parses it for "custom" tags = which I've defined.  Using custom scanner and tag, I'm able to replace = my "custom tags" with appropriate HTML/Javascript in the toHtml() method = for each tag.  However, I'd like to add some validation to my code to = ensure certain constraints are observed, such as certain tags which = REQUIRE a "name" attribute to be defined.  I've done this easily enough = by adding a "verify()" method to my custom tags and throwing a = ParserException if a constraint is violated. However, just throwing an exception does not help the webpage developer = determine where the problem is in the HTML.  What would REALLY help me = is if the Node object had a method on it called something like = getLineNumber() which returned the line number at which that node was = parsed. I've looked at the source code and this seems feasible.  The NodeReader = class keeps track of the current line number as it finds nodes in the = HTML.  Maybe the constructor for a Node() object could take in one more = argument, the lineNumber, so that it could expose that lineNumber in a = public method. Does this sound like a hairbrained idea?  Has this ever come up before? Thanks again, Marc Novakowski</body>

    <body>Hi Marc, What you say makes sense. A node should know which line it began and which line it ended. The reason we don't do this already, we only used it to pick up the next node, which is on the same or the next line. Like you said, doing this is not hard as the reader stores the line info. It should be in one of the integration releases (do add this as a feature request so we don't forget).

    <body>Hi, I wrote a visitor and register with the Parser. Basically I was paersing a web page and dump the result to a file. I close the FileOutputStream in my visitEndTag as such: public void visitEndTag(EndTag endTag) if ( endTag.getTagName().equalsIgnoreCase("HTML") ) //flus and close the file outputstream However, my program is getting the IOException saying that the outputstream is closed while I was still trying to write to it. I then realize that my "if" statement in the visitEndTagis not a correct signal for determining that the parser is done parsing. Can anyone please help me find out if there's any way that I can know the parser is finished parsing? Thanks. Joe __________________________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!

    <date>Sat Mar 08 05:12:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hi Richard, Thanks for bringing up this question. The parser is licensed under LGPL. This means, applications that USE it dont have to be open-source. But, here are two restrictions that apply: [1] Any modifications made to the library itself must be kept open-source or made available. [2] Your app source code does not live with the parser source code, but the object code does. That means - people should either be able to reverse engineer your product so as to be able to remove the parser library and put a newer version in (gasp!) or - simply provide an external linkage to the parser - whereby folks can swap out the current version with a later version (the idea is to let them have the benefit of the open-source library). That reverse engineering stuff is actually a cryptic interpretation of the clause - applicable only if you want to provide a single executable in your application (it can be bypassed, but I dont want to further complicate the interpretation for you - let me know if this is the case and I can advise you accordingly). Bytway, if you are not distributing your application, and only using it internally, none of the above applies. Let me know if that answers your question.

    <body>hi, We are trying to use the html parser (v 1.3) on a linux box. Our corpous is on disk, so we are passing just the file name to the Parser constructor while instantiating the object. Going through the code, we found that it prefixes file://localhost . While this works in Windows, it doesn't on linux. We tried to set prefix string to just file:/ and file: . But it throws some exception as error in setConnection() and prefixes some thing like ftp:// to the file name. It would be really helpful if you would point out where else the changes have to be made. Thanks, __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? The New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.

    <date>Sun Apr 20 03:04:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Hi Folks, This week's release is out. From the change log: Integration Build 1.3 - 20030420 -------------------------------- [1] Fixed bug #722046 StringExtractor.extractStrings misses most of the text, change to use a StringBean to dig into tables. [2] add checking in Translate to eliminate bug #722835 StringIndexOutOfBoundsException exception [3] added line-break condition in assertXmlEquals [4] added fit testing framework [5] added parent association for each node [6] added digupStringNode() and findPositionOf(Node) to CompositeTag [7] Fixed bug 723835 in LinkExtractor We have some powerful searching capability with this release. From any node, you can find the parent composite tag, and navigate thru the entire html structure. This is useful in scenarios like : Search for data that lies close to a certain piece of text. We can extract John Doe, by using our knowledge of its expected position. If we assume that the contents are inside a table tag, here's what a program could look like: // Lets assume our data is in the second table // Find the position of Name. // We assume that the first node that matched is the one we want. We navigate to its parent // From the parent, we shall find out the position of "Name" // Its easy now to navigate to John Doe, as we know it is 3 positions away This can be useful for writing tests for your pages or extracting position based info - new possibilities open up for semantic searches.

    <body>I have difficulities with webpages that uses "windows-1252", "windows-1256" and "ISO-8859-1", since they are not recognized by HTMLparser and it usee ISO instead, which ruins the text. is there any way to convert all these to true Unicode, like UTF-8 encoding? i have tried several methods from java.nio.charset* and also "String a = new String(s.getBytes("ISO-8859-1"), "UTF-8")", without any luck. it seems that the text gets corrupt directly under InputStream. please help! tanks, rezamotori -- _______________________________________________ Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</body>

    <body>Hi Folks, This week's release contains : Integration Build 1.3 - 20030413 -------------------------------- [1] reimplement StringBean as NodeVisitor, testStringBeanListener now = succeeds [2] Implemented feature request 702541 (Tags created by = CompositeTagScanner now have startLine and endLine information in their TagData) [3] Modified ScriptScanner to allow for subclassing and fixed minor bug [4] Re-architected CompositeTagScanner [5] Fixed Tag scanning bugs, OOM exceptions connected to #4 Thanks to Derrick Oswald for his work on the StringBean and Marc = Novakowski for his work on adding line number support. In this release, the CompositeTagScanner has been totally redesigned - = using principles of Evolutionary Design. The new code is dramatically = simpler and easier to understand. I tried ED on assertXmlEquals last = week and had the same results. The Out of Memory bugs have been fixed - = it will be good to have some freedback. For those who might be interested in ED, before taking each step, I have = taken a snapshot and put it in CVS. Many thanks to Josh Kerievsky for = teaching me how to do ED. Cheers, Somik</body>

I need to extract the text that is around links to do the focussed crawling...for eg i need to know what are the 10 words before and after the given link..

    <body>My suggestion is: dont register any scanners except for the link scanner. Create your own algo that saves prev nodes and next string nodes the way you want. (You can get 10 words out of each from the string nodes) You might find this easy to do in the visitors - check the documentation on how to write visitors - http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/docs/ Regards, Somik --- vihang dalal &amp;lt;vihang_dalal@...&amp;gt; wrote: http://tax.yahoo.com ------------------------------------------------------- http://www.etnus.com https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/htmlparser-user __________________________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

    <body>HI Somik, I read the documenation as well as saw the sample program on how to make visitors. But i am still unclear as to what does a visitor exactly do. In my case i need to visit the string node before and after the link node if there are any. So how do i write a visitor for that ? Also i need to retrieve entire sting a well as all the links in a page. So eveytime do i need to define 2 parsers to do it...I tried using 1 parser but it doesnt work. HOwever using 2 parsers for the same page worked.

    <body>&amp;gt;  I read the documenation as well as saw the sample A visitor basically visits all the nodes. When a certain node is visited, the appropriate visit method is automatically called. If you've used the apache parsers (xerces) - it follows the same model - it is often known as the SAX model of parsing. In patterns terminology - we call it an Internal Iterator. (Check the book - design patterns by Erich Gamma). To solve your problem, you will have to work hard and create an algorithm that will use the visitor and maintain flags, etc.. (Do not get confused, this is not about logic in the parser, no flags need to be set, etc.. I am talking about logic you have to develop on your own). To speed up your learning, at least try the sample programs that use a visitor. Get hold of a nice debugger - and step through the sample program right from the beginning, to get a clear understanding (or read the code which many people find simpler).

    <date>Fri Apr 11 07:15:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Hi Somik, Basically I am trying to convert or re-write html into 'slightly' formatted plain text.  (Wiki formatting in fact, something like "tag conversion") So I want to change "&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;" in "\n" and "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;" into "\n\n" If I find "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;blah blah&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" I just want to ignore the "&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;".  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; will sometimes have an end tag and sometimes not. If using the Visitor method is it suitable for doing a re-write of a document? Or is Visitor just for doing extractions of all the Links for example? Thank you for any pointers.

    <body>Hi Linz, Thats interesting. I recently put out a WikiGrabber - which does something similar - the idea was to use a Wiki for creating documentation, and convert that to static html. Check http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikigrabber There are no releases yet, but the source is in cvs. The parser project itself uses WikiGrabber to create the doc bundle. A visitor is very useful for this sort of work. Check the WikiGrabber code- it does similar things - modifying certain tags in certain ways, while keeping the rest of the html intact. Basically, override the common visitXXX() methods and have them call toHtml and add this to a stringbuffer. Your requirements can be easily met in visitTag() - check if its br or p, and do the needful. There is visitEndTag - where u can HTH.

    <body>Hi Linz Can you describe the problem that you're trying to solve ? It will be easier to advise you if we have the whole picture. Writing a scanner should not be the first option (when parsing html) - try and see if a visitor does not solve the same problem easily. Making &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; a CompositeTagScanner is not a good idea at this time. The CompositeTagScanner took a quantum leap (2 weeks back) and it didn't quite make it - there are some important bugs that need tackling, with regard to its handling of non-ended tags.

    <body>Hi Somik and everybody else, Things are really going fast and interesting here. It is a great job. I hope once my program is completed, I can share it with others. Well, I faced a new problem yesterday. It may not be very much related to HTMLParser, but I appreciate it if any one could give me a hint. My program uses HTMLparser classes to access sites and extract all urls, and then in another run, using those urls, it extract data from pages of those urls. There is this site which uses MicorsoftCommerc Server 2000, and attaches the cookie to url, if request is not from a Browser: some thing like this. http://www.shoemall.com/product.asp?family%5Fid=2543&amp;amp;type=0&amp;amp;cat%5Fid= 0&amp;amp;MSCSProfile=61E4CECF7275066FD87B9817DA5865CBE5EA506A04C53D8558451EC3D02BB57732 7CA398F52348946BD1631D503EA92FF120A8E45A336FAD8E7E4E31B1356470B79DDD041A4F98A5B4 03FC86D8A52985761A9F6CEA80 And once I try to access the same page with same url, every time I get a differnt page!!! Can anybody tell me why this is so? and How can I change my java program to avoid it, or recieve the correct page. I am also using connectionnew.setRequestProperty ("User-Agent","Mozilla/3.0(Windows NT 4.0; U) Opera but still this does help!

    <date>Wed May 28 03:22:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Hi there, I am unable to obtain table rows, table columns. When iterating through the document, as my code comes across a node(&amp;lt;TABLE&amp;gt;) which is an instanceof Tag, after applying the to.Html() method to it, it prints out the entire table(refer to below)rather than just &amp;lt;TABLE&amp;gt; tag as expected. The next iteration of the document, as it comes across a node (Im expecting it to be &amp;lt;TR&amp;gt;)  which is an instanceof Tag, the to.Html() method returns &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;. The same problem happens when I use instanceof TableTag. I have added the TableRowScanner and the TableColumnScanner. Ive attempted to do instanceof TableRow and instanceof TableColumn however it seems that these are simply ignored.  Could I please get some help as to how to obtain the TableRow and Table Column tags? Sample part of html document: http://www.hotmail.com http://www.hotmail.com http://www.emailcash.com http://www.ninemsn.com Thanks for listening.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Getting Unmodified HREF= Attribute Values in ver. 1.3</header>
    <date>Tue May 27 16:14:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Hello, Again, I have another problem with changed behavior in version 1.3 compared to 1.2. I am using LinkTag.getLink() to get the target of a link. In version 1.2 this returned the unadorned value of the HREF= attribute as it appeared in the HTML document. This is what I want and what I need. In version 1.3, the result is modified when the link is relative. I'm (currently) processing local files, not documents retrieved via network a URL and the relative links are being resolved to something like this: Input file name: "C:/SHS/Web/Biography/Biography.html" HTML fragment: "&amp;lt;a href="SHS.html"&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;" getLlink() return value: " file://localhostC:/SHS/Web/Biography/SHS.html " Not only is this not what I want, it's also malformed, since the required slash between the (gratuitous) "localhost" and the (gratuitous) "C:/SHS/Web/Biography/" is missing. How can I get the original behavior? Thanks. Randy</body>

    <body>Hi, Following up on my latest lament... I'm using this method to get unmodified HREF= attribute values: private String linkHREF(LinkTag link) if (href != null) if (href != null) The documentation doesn't make clear if Tag.getAttribute() performs alphabetic case canonicalization on the attribute names in the tags in the HTML input and on its arguments, so I tried two of the 16 possible combinations of upper and lower case among four letters.

    <body>Randall, Attributes are stored in the hashtable with uppercase keys and getAttribute() converts it's argument to uppercase also. The two examples are the same. As Mark suggests, writing a visitor to handle links is probably the best approach. But you may want to override visitLinkTag() instead. File a bug report regarding " file://localhostC:/ ", we're pretty unix centric and just missed that one.

    <body>Hi Randall, I faced very similar problems when I migrated to 1.3. Basically I believe the structure now returned has more of a DOM face than a SAX one as earlier. Earlier all nodes were available at the base level. Today they are buried within other nodes. Hence your &amp;lt;A&amp;gt; is buried in the Code for extracing link tag is given in documentation of node. Reproducing it here for u: NodeList collectionList =3D new NodeList();=20 Node node;=20 =20 This will get link nodes at all levels.

    <body>Dhaval, Thanks for the information. Does this mean that there is not a strictly stream-based way to examine a complete HTML document? I don't mean to be impertinent, but this seems like a weaker design than that used in version 1.2. I don't like having to build collections containing portions of the document's contents when all I'm doing is making a single pass over the file. I think a purely stream-oriented model, whenever suitable to the driving application, is distinctly preferred. Building DOM-like structures when there's no need for random access to their sub-structure seems like a waste of memory. If there's a way to preserve the kind of program design I was using, I'd really like to know about it. Thanks again. Randall Schulz At 00:12 2003-05-27, dhaval.udani@... wrote:</body>

    <body>Hi Randall, Lets not get critical over the design of 1.3. I think it has helped to bring about a great degree of stability as well as correctness into the parser. The isitor pattern employed has helped a lotand its really visible to a person like me who has used the parser extensively in my project. I also had a stream-based approach and I managed to maintain the same through a recursive approach of searching the page and then reproducing it. If u let me know your design and your requirement, there will definitely be a way out, only that we will have to search for it.

It's not stream oriented because it forces the entire file to be read and an array holding the entire set of links to be collected before I can process them. Nonetheless, Dhaval's solution worked fine. Now what I really need is unmodified HREF= attribute values.

    <body>The default Visitors may collect the tags into collections, but it = completely possible to write your own Visitor that handles each tag as = it is parsed in the source document.  Just override the "visitTag()" = method and do what you want with each tag as it's parsed.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Link Extraction from Tables w/ ver. 1.3</header>
    <date>Tue May 27 06:06:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Hi, I have a properly functioning link extraction program based on HTMLParser 1.2. I'm trying to convert it to HTMLParser 1.3 (the newly released final version). I've fixed up all the changed data types, but I'm finding that links (&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; tags) contained within tables are being skipped. If in my node processing loop I replace the calls to my internal node processing function (which is called only if the node is an instance of LinkTag) with System.out.println(node.toString()); (for all returned node types), I see tables coming through as "blobs," if you will. That is, I see the entire &amp;lt;TABLE&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/TABLE&amp;gt; element in the output as a single node with none of its internal structure parsed. I've tried adding a TableScanner to the parser (using parser.addScanner(new TableScanner(parser, "-tb"));), a TableRowScanner (using parser.addScanner(new TableRowScanner("-tr", parser));) and a TableColumnScanner (using parser.addScanner(new TableColumnScanner("-tc"));), but to no avail. What am I missing? How to I process _all_ of the link tags within the input document? Thanks. Randall Schulz</body>

Can you suggest a better way to choose a character set? The parse did find an off-by-one error in the way htmlparser stacks nodes. I fixed that and it will be available in the next integration release (1_3_20030425).

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] anchor tag issue?</header>
    <date>Fri May 23 16:26:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>I just started looking at HTMLParser yesterday so forgive me if this is an incorrect question.  Basically I have a "dirty" HTML document coming out of MS Word 2000 that I need to parse to pull some information from and store in portions of in a database.  One of the tags that Word uses throughout is the LinkScanner, LinkTagData classes to become NamedLinkTag, NamedLinkScanner, and NamedLinkTagData as I needed to be able to get the name used for the anchor. I tehn extended the LinkScannerTest class to have 3 tests of my own. The last test looks like this assertTrue("The node should be a named link tag",node[0] instanceof assertEquals("Link Text of link tag","Click This test keeps failing on the parseAndAssertNodeCount(1) method with returning a 3 instead of a 1.  What is the likely cause of this?  It almost seems as though the &amp;lt;a name=""&amp;gt; is not seen a link (thus a namedlinktag), by the parser? Thanks for your help, Greg</body>

    <date>Sat May 17 18:43:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Hello, first, I'd like to appologize for being idle since last summer but I had = a lot of other works to do. The "quarilis project", a search engine, for which I used HTMLParser, is = in beta status.You can see some information in French about this project on = the web page: http://www.quarilis.org and the link to HTMLParser at http://www.quarilis.org/liens.html . We used HTMLParser to parse and WGET = to crawl but we have in project to let HTMLParser do the whole work. Now, for a month, I have had some time to work for my own. I projected a long time ago to parse web pages from a French tv program website to info= rm me when a series I like is broadcast. I'm really impressed by the progress of the crawler and parser, but I hav= e a problem. This is not a bug but a strange result. When I try to parse http://television.telerama.fr/tv_62.asp?lettre=3DW fo= r example, the result is: [...] Wasteland Lendemain de f=EAte 11:40 sur TF6 Week-end bleu - Spin City Accident de bus 16:25 sur Canal + Bleu Confidences dans un avion 16:45 sur Canal + Bleu La visite du pr=E9sident 16:05 sur Canal + Bleu Le bras droit du maire est amoureux 17:05 sur Canal + Bleu [...] and the HTML code is: [...] ,Helvetica" size=3D"2" color=3D"#000066"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Wasteland&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td colspan=3D= 2 width=3D"405"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font face=3DArial,Helvetica size=3D2 color=3D#000066&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Le= ndemain de ,Helvetica" size=3D"2" color=3D"#000066"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Week-end bleu - Spin City&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;t= r&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td colspan=3D2 width=3D"405"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font face=3DArial,Helvetica size=3D2 [...] Apparently, there isn't a new line with a &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; if the &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; is on the sam= e line ? Why not put a carriage return after every &amp;lt;td&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; ?  That wa= y, it would be easier to retrieve information. I suggest to have such an output: [...] Wasteland Lendemain de f=EAte 11:40 sur TF6 Week-end bleu - Spin City Accident de bus 16:25 sur Canal + Bleu Confidences dans un avion 16:45 sur Canal + Bleu La visite du pr=E9sident 16:05 sur Canal + Bleu Le bras droit du maire est amoureux 17:05 sur Canal + Bleu [...] I hope you'll appreciate my idea, but if you prefer to let it like this, = can you tell me, please, where I can patch to obtain the result I want (class= es have changed a lot since last summer) ...

    <body>Cédric, What you want ("\r\n" after each &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;) can be done with table handling code similar to the response I gave to Patrick Gamble: Re: [Htmlparser-user] Can the program do this? However, if you want to do it within the current code structure, you would need to override toHtml() in TableRow and TableColumn.

    <body>I really think that having a carriage return put by the parser is a bad idea, since it could distort output and hence affect the display in a browser. Dhaval P.S. In fact I did have a case earlier wherein, due to the parser putting in extra carriage returns during toHtml(), I was getting a distorted output in my browser.</body>

    <body>Hello all, Maybe you could help me out with these: I have been studying two books: Web Content Mining with Java and Programing Spiders, bots and Aggregators in Java. Well, I am a Computer Science student and I am very much interested on Java which I am always studying in my free time. I have my own websites that I wrote with PHP. Now, suppose I have two types of situation, a page that I pass an URL with a ?code=23928393 after it, so a GET and I have a page with a table returned. Case number 2 is a page where I need to post the code and get the same table back. Now, what I would like you to teach me is how to write a very simple sample app that either call http://www.someurl.com?code=2382832 and parse the returning page's table to fetch its content one by one and a post to http://www.someurl.com/search.php4 where there is a code text field and a submit button in it. The result is the same page's table that I need to parse. So: 1) Who do I call a URL? Who to do POST and GET? 2) Who do I parse the returning table? Could you help me out teaching me a quick and dirty start? I would apreciate it much. Thanks in advance! regards, Carlos Fernando Scheidecker Antunes.</body>

Thus, you can monitor the code repository for bug fixes and enhancements. A new list was chosen over sending to the htmlparser-developer list directly to provide an opt-out mechanism and to keep the traffic light on the htmlparser-developer list.

    <body>Beate, It turns out that you discovered a bug in the BODY tag processor. For tracking purposes it's #731684 body and title tags with attributes not parsed. I should have it fixed shortly. Regarding your table question, if you just want all the text out of a web page, use something like this: public class GetText /** * GetText * @param args Pass arg[0] as the URL to process. */ public static void main (String[] args) if (0 &amp;gt;= args.length) System.out.println ("Usage: java -classpath htmlparser.jar:. http://whatever_url else But if you need to dig into tables and get a specific cell, the code you need is something like this (when the bug is fixed): public class Example /** * Example * @param args Pass arg[0] as the URL to process. */ public static void main (String[] args) try while (iterator.hasMoreNodes ()) if (node instanceof BodyTag) while (enumeration.hasMoreElements ()) System.out.println (key + ": " + attributes.get for (int h = 0; h &amp;lt; contents.length; h++) if (contents[h] instanceof TableTag) rows = for (int i = 0 ; i &amp;lt; rows.length; i++) if (rows[i] instanceof TableRow) columns = for (int j = 0; j &amp;lt; columns.length; j++) if (columns[j] instanceof TableColumn) cells = cells.length; k++) if (cells[k] instanceof StringNode) System.out.println catch (ParserException pe)</body>

    <body>Hi Somik, Its JAK.... just as a quick reminder ... I was trying to parse java documentation on Sun site by using your captureWiki program. Initially the problem seemed to be with frame but I don't think the problem is to do with frames, I have tried a non-frame version of same documentation ( http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/overview-summary.html ) but the program still prompts that no links were found in the page even though there are lots of links on that page. I have also tried to parse webpage which were stored locally on my computer but the parser does not seem to like that either. According to the documentation the parser should be able to autodetect when the file or URL is passed through the parameter, when the file name is passed, it compiles sucessfully but gives run time error. Error: setConnection() : Error in opening a connection to file://localhost/index.html I do anticipate that you are a very busy person and I am very sorry to bother you, I will be very thankful if you could resolve this issue of parsing Java Documentation by using your captureWiki program. Thank you very much JAK _________________________________________________________________ On the move? Get Hotmail on your mobile phone http://www.msn.co.uk/msnmobile</body>

    <body>As we are a .NET shop, we have been trying to use HTMLParser in J#.  I've gotten the system to build with a few minor changes, but now I'm running into a problem when I go to parse something. I have the Parser New and Parser.RegisterScanners functions working fine. The big problem comes up when I try to do the Extract Links Example. Basically, the system bombs out in NodeReader.getNextLine at the line that contains: From what I can see, it appears that the readLine does not go out to the Parser.reader input buffer stream.

    <date>Wed Jun 11 16:03:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Hello all, is there some documentation what the filter parameter for scanners means? I noticed some code like: What does that -b mean? What would "" mean? Background: I'm using the htmlparser to index web pages for Apache Lucene and would like to just index text nodes that appear in the body of an HTML document. I read about the StringBean, but that makes a HTTP connection, which is of no use to me, as I read the files locally. My code looks like this: // just collect text nodes in one StringBuffer // treat meta tags specially // treat title tags specially So I tried registering a BodyScanner, but for some reason it never fired. Maybe because I made a mistake in using "" as filter parameter? Thank you very much in advance for any pointers, Ulrich -- Ulrich Mayring DENIC eG, Systementwicklung</body>

    <body>&amp;gt; is there some documentation what the filter parameter for scanners You can ignore it-  it is mostly for command line usage of the parser. Legacy, and should/would be removed in a later release.. I am not sure if the StringBean cannot handle local files - Derrick Oswald can clarify that.. Looking at your code, it seems like you would benefit with the visitor mechanism - check http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php/LinkExtraction , example 3. I also don't think you need a BodyScanner- use that only if you want a big BODY object (if you want a DOM model). Regards, Somik</body>

I looked at that example before, but it appeared to me it would need more memory and perform worse (please correct me if I'm wrong). To me it looks like the visitor mechanism reads in the whole document and then for each type of node the whole document is traversed in search of the right nodes (DOM style). In my code example I need to traverse the document only once (SAX style) and as I encounter each node I decide what to do with it. Ok, but there is apparently no way to find out for a Node if it is within the body or not. So I thought to wait for the body node to appear and to start extracting strings only then. cheers, Ulrich -- Ulrich Mayring DENIC eG, Systementwicklung</body>

The document is traversed in real-time - the visitor methods are called as the traversal is progressing. Yes there is. In visitTag(), check if you've recieved the BODY tag (use boolean flags :).

    <body>Ulrich, Yes, NodeVisitor is the one to extend, unless you just want to extend the functionality of one of the other derived classes. For composite tags, if the visitors recurse children is true the children of the tag are visited. If the visitors recurse self is true, the tag itself is visited after the children are visited. The org.htmlparser.beans.StringBean class is an example of a visitor implementation. Derrick Ulrich Mayring wrote:</body>

    <body>Gil, The support is there, although a guy named Steve had some trouble with a "GB2312"(chinese encoding) because the java.nio.charset.Charset doesn't support it.  The parser first sets the charset according to the charset specified in the HTTP header. It then prescans the header looking for a charset directive in the HTML page and resets to the new charset if it's different.  One of the testcases is to fetch " http://www.ibm.com/jp/ " and ensure the charset is correctly set to Shift_JIS, although no attempt is made to ensure the resultant text is correct.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Traversing the tree multiple times</header>
    <date>Mon Jun 02 18:02:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>I would like to build a DOM style access to my parsed HTML. Currently if I use extractAllNodesThatAre(Html.class), then try to do a extractAllNodesThatAre(TablTag.class) iteration, I get an empty list. I've tried hacking recreateReader() to public, pending a proper wrapping method. But then the NodeList comes as different objects to  the previous parse. i) Is there any way to reset the parser 'cursor'? ii) Perhaps overriding the equals() in a Node is in order? Each tag can be uniquely identified by a Vector of parent tags and offset from said parent tag. Thus Node a.equals(b) could be driven from the path back to the root node? a Java equivalent to WebL, which is a Modula2 derivative. [ http://research.compaq.com/SRC/WebL/library.html ] Then HtmlParser would really start to shine. WebL is a bit too heavy, and doesn't run on JVMs more modern than 1.1!

    <body>Terry, Could you gather all the top level nodes into a NodeList once, and then run your extracts against that? The code in Parser to do the extraction is pretty simple: public Node [] extractAllNodesThatAre(Class nodeType) throws ParserException for (NodeIterator e = elements(); e.hasMoreNodes();) so your code would be: public Node [] extractAllNodesThatAre(NodeList topLevel, Class nodeType) for (NodeIterator e = topLevel.elements(); e.hasMoreNodes();) Derrick Terry Alexis Lurie wrote: http://research.compaq.com/SRC/WebL/library.html ]</body>

    <date>Wed Jun 04 10:41:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Hi guys, thanks for all yor help so far. I have experienced this from the beginning, but I've always found a work around so far. Now I am at my wits end. When I parse a Google result page, HtmlParser gets the parse wrong. I have visually eyeballed the html, to make sure. What I've found, is that when a &amp;lt;TABLE&amp;gt; node is returned, the Node 'leaks' out into further HTML, beyond the &amp;lt;/TABLE&amp;gt; closing. I do have examples, and I can post code, but I have a deadline, so I thought I would test the waters to see if there is a quick solution. At first there were completely wrong results, and I fixed that by not calling registerDomScanners(). Instead I cut&amp;amp;pasted what this equated to into my own code, and commented out most of the scanners I didn't need. This was fine. But now I discover that on some Google pages an advertisers box (TABLE) is inserted, and the TABLE leak/runover problem causes my code to barf. This is driving me mad, and I don't have the time to step-by-step through the HtmlParser to see where it is failing. I have tried the 1_4 release as well, which didn't fair any better. Thanks, this is a repeatable verifiable error, but perhaps I'm missing something?

    <body>Hi Christian, The form tag contains the contents you want, but it's buried within the table tag: Search: The form scanner extends the CompositeScanner which blindly gathers up the tags inside, so you get a couple of StringNodes and a TableTag. The FormTag constructor code was performing a searchFor() the input and textarea tags but wasn't doing it recursively. I've added code to the NodeList class to do that now. In case you want to check out the files before the next integration build, the files affected are org/htmlparser/tags/FormTag.java org/htmlparser/util/NodeList.java I also added getFormTextAreas() to FomTag so you can get all the textarea tags.

    <date>Fri Jul 25 04:03:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>I am parsing input HTML with custom scanners looking for custom tags.  The input HTML is divided into 2 sections.  Im parsing these 2 sections separately to render a page.  Is possible for the parser NOT to add the closing tags for me in section 1, because the closing tags are located in section 2? For example, have &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; open tag in section 1 and section 1, I need to preserve &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; without the closing tag. Thanks, Warren... __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo! SiteBuilder - Free, easy-to-use web site design software http://sitebuilder.yahoo.com</body>

    <body>Your question is very similar to a previous support request: #736449 extractAllNodesThatAre http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;amp;atid=381400&amp;amp;aid=736449&amp;amp;group_id=24399 in that you would like to pass through the nodes more than once. The file Editor.java, that is attached to that request, has it's own 'extractAllNodesThatAre()' method operating on a NodeList that is collected only once. I think that should point you in the correct direction (or at least give you one way of doing it). Derrick jd sw wrote:</body>

    <date>Thu Aug 21 01:23:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>Yes, indeed, I think this is one of the most important of the goals for the new i/o subsystem I'm working on. From org.htmlparser.lexer.package.html: The following are some design goals and 'invariants' within the package, if you are attempting to understand or modify it. Things that differ substantially from previous implementations are highlighted in *bold*. Contiguous Nodes *Adjacent nodes have no characters between them.* The list of nodes forms an uninterrupted chain that, by start and end definitions, completely covers the characters that were read from the HTML source. Despite this, the nodes are not stored in a linked list, but rather an array to ease any editing tasks that may be performed. Text Fidelity Besides complete coverage, the *nodes do not contain copies of the text*, but instead simply contain offsets into a single large buffer that contains the text read from the HTML source. Even within tags, the attributes list can contain whitespace, thus there is no lost whitespace or text formatting either outside or within tags. Upper and lower case text is preserved. Line Endings *End of line characters are just whitespace.* There is no distinction made between end of line characters (or pairs of characters on Windows) and other whitespace. The text is not read in line by line so nodes (tags) can easily span multiple lines with no special processing. Line endings are not transformed between platforms, i.e. Unix line endings are not converted to Windows line endings by this level. Each node will has a starting and ending location, which the page can use to extract the text. To facilitate formatting error and log messages the page can turn these offsets into row and column numbers. In general ignore line breaks in the source if at all possible. One Parser, One Scan The Lexer has the following state machines corresponding (roughly) to the *four parsers it replaces* (StringParser, RemarkNodeParser, # TagParser &amp;amp; AttributeParser): in text - parseString() # in comment - parseRemark() # in tag - parseTag() By integrating the four state machines into one, a single pass over the text is all that's needed for a low level parse of the HTML source. In previous implementations, the attributes were parsed on a second scan after the initial tag was extracted. Two Jars For elementary operations at the node level, a minimalist jar file containing *only the lexer and base tag classes* is split out from the larger |htmlparser.jar|. In this way, simple parsing and output is handled with a jar file that is under 40 kilobytes, but anything beyond peephole manipulation, i.e. closing tag detection and other semantic reasoning, will need the full set of scanners, nodes and ancillary classes, which now stands at 160 kilobytes. I don't think the formatting of the above will make it through the list mangler but you can get it yourself from CVS if you can't read it here. Derrick Marc Novakowski wrote:</body>

    <body>Costa, The storage of attributes in a Hashtable by name, would preclude getting any more than one of them (the last). I'm working on another way to store attributes, in a Vector. The new toHtml() method honours the three attributes of the same name. It also has the ability to access duplicates like this via a replacement for the getAttributes() method called getAttributesEx(), which currently returns the vector rather than a Hashtable. The getAttribute() method which returns only one string is more problematic. Until then (htmlparser version 1.4), I'm afraid there is no way to retain or get at the first two style attributes, sorry.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Getting Node values and deciding which nodes to get</header>
    <date>Thu Aug 14 06:42:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>The help on this list has been great! Thank you all! I have other questions that I would like to ask your help again. Thanks to the help of this list I can navigate the table with the following code: However list.elementAt(k) returns the type of the element followed by its values. For instance: Text = NANDO ANTUNES              ; begins at : 129; ends at : 52 So, I believe this is a type Text that is the value of what is shown on the column. I would like to know if I could get the begins at value, the ends at value and then get only the value which is "NANDO ANTUNES" in this case. How can I do it? I have the same for the font property of the row as the other properties. For instance: ends at : 57 Again, how can I copy just the values and control when it begins and when it ends with the "begins at" and "ends at" values? Looking at the documentation I, the best tip I still have is elementsAt() method. So I think that I should have elements() returns an iterator to each Node on the list. Therefore I must use elementBegin() and elementEnd() to return the int values of them and then getText() for the actual text, right? Now, how can I know what Kind of Node it is? I wouldn't be interested on all the Nodes just a few and also just from some colums. Thanks in advance for the help!</body>

    <body>C.F. You can ues instanceof to detect what type it is and then cast it: if (list.elementAt(k) instanceof StringNode) Similarly for the other classes RemarkNode and Tag. Tag, of course, has many subclasses, like LinkTag. To see the subclasses you are getting, try: The 'begin' and 'end' values reflect where the text or tag lies in the original HTML stream on a line. In the case of multiple lines (like your's looks like) it may not be so useful, and you certainly can't 'control' where it begins and ends. I would ignore this. I should have originally advised you to use toPlainTextString() instead of toString(). Derrick C.F. Scheidecker Antunes wrote:</body>

    <body>C.F. It depends on what's in the column, what type of 'values' you'll get. Could be just text or links or forms etc. The contents will be in the children (it's a CompositeTag) so one of SimpleNodeIterator(), getChild(), getChildrenAsNodeArray() or getChildren() should be used to get at the Node objects that are contained within the column, i.e. for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; list.size; i++) Derrick C.F.

    <body>Your first example indicates you want to trigger text collection after a all text after that. Subclass org.htmlparser.beans.StringBean and override visitStringNode() and visitEndTag(). Look for a tag name of "BIG" and set a flag to start collecting text only then: public class MyBean extends StringBean ... public void visitStringNode (StringNode string) if (triggered) public void visitEndTag (EndTag end) if (end.getTagName ().equals ("BIG")) Derrick yopllit wrote:</body>

    <body>Joe, I think you would need to subclass StringBean and override 'visitTag ()' with something like: void visitTag (Tag tag) if (isMySpecialCommentTag (tag)) else with similar code in 'visitEndTag ()' to turn off the flag. Then handle the flag (i.e. override visitStringNode ()) in methods that need to do something different. Derrick Joe.A.Silvagni@... wrote:</body>

    <body>Chris, I recently integrated code to configure the parser to decode strings. To use it, do the following: * instantiate org.htmlparser.StringNodeFactory and set its shouldDecodeNodes(true). * instantiate the parser and set its StringNodeFactory by calling setStringNodeFactory(...). * begin parsing by iterating through the nodes or using a TextExtractVisitor to obtain the text you need. -jk Christopher Bird wrote: http://aspnet.click-url.com/go/psa00100003ave/direct;at.aspnet_072303_01/01 https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/htmlparser-user</body>

The only thing the parser gleans from the HTTP header is the character set. Are you sure it's reading anything at all? Try the command line: java -jar htmlparser.jar c:\Par-HTML\JavaDoc\docs\api\index.html and see what it prints out that it's parsing. Use that in your program.

    <body>Hi Derrick, I am trying to analyse Java Documentation via Parser.

    <body>You can pass a fully conditioned URLConnection object to the parser via the setConnection() call. R.T.F.M. Using the visitor pattern, you extend NodeVisitor and override at least visitTag() and visitEndTag() watching for the &amp;lt;PRE&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;/PRE&amp;gt;.  Other overrides from NodeVisitor depend on what you want to extract. See StringBean for an example. C.F. Scheidecker Antunes wrote:</body>

    <body>Kerem, I don't think I can help much. Take it one step at a time. If you changed the default charset you must have a development environment in order to recompile it. First, check the what encoding the InputStreamReader is really using after it's created by dumping the output of getEncoding() at the end of Parser.createInputStreamReader(): If that's OK, check the incoming characters in NodeReader.getNextLine(). Depending on your environment, this should probably show correct characters: If that's OK, enclose the HTML text in &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; and see if it's getting messed up by Decode(). ... Other than that, you'll have to debug it I'm afraid. Derrick kerem balik wrote:</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Building New Tags to Output</header>
    <date>Wed Sep 17 13:24:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>I suspect this is a pretty basic question but I couldn't find anything in the archives or the doc. I am building a tool used to 'fix up' the html generated by MS Word with the ultimate destination being a JavaHelp file.  Among other things, one of the things I want to do is remove the embedded style sheet and insert a &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; tag to an external style sheet. The approach I am using is to initially parse the document into a NodeList and then I iterate over the list with a NodeVisitor for each of the various things I want to do to the document.  This approach has generally worked great.  I can find the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; tag using this technique and then look at the children and remove the embedded style sheet without a problem.  However, I am have difficulty determining how to manufacture a &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; tag as a Tag object relatively easily.  If I could do this I could then add it as a child to the head.  Finally, after I have done all of my cleanup I could iterate over all of the nodes one last time to create the new html.  Any thoughts on how to generate the Thanks for the help</body>

    <body>There's no easy way. The LinkTagTest code does a lot of these constructs: link = new LinkTag( new TagData(0,0,"",""), new CompositeTagData(null,null,null), new LinkData(" irc://server/channel","","",false,false ) You'll have to figure out the construtors for the arguments. I saw this problem, and for the new lexer package I've added a zero args constrcutor for TagNode. Derrick Mark Ault wrote:</body>

    <body>Thought I would post what I ended up using as my solution.  Both just to document it and to seek if anyone just plain thinks it is a bad idea. I found in one of the test cases places where HTML string fragments were defined in the code and then parsed.  So, what I ended up doing is building the link tag that I wanted (looked something like &amp;lt;LINK HREF="/mystylsheet.css" REL="stylesheet" TYPE="text/css"&amp;gt; and then parsing that using the Parser.createParser(String) method.  This just seemed more obvious what what going on than trying to figure out how to construct a tag on your own.  I then find the &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt; tag and add it as a child to the &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt; tag in the document I am modifying. BTW - I find the reference to the &amp;lt;A&amp;gt; tag as a LinkTag little misleading since there is an actual &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt; tag.  I know the &amp;lt;A&amp;gt; tag is commonly referred to as a link but....  I probably wouldn't have thought about it if I had not been interested in inserting a &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt; tag. Great library.  Keep up the good work! Derrick Oswald wrote: irc://server/channel","","",false,false ) http://thinkgeek.com/sf https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/htmlparser-user</body>

Here's a suggestion, create the parser on html directly, like so: Parser parser = Parser.createParser("&amp;lt;a // proceed to parse links. This could be a useful testcase to demonstrate the bug. If you can make this a JUnit testcase that fails, that would be even better - a developer could then easily jump in and debug. I must thank you for taking the time to report the bug.

    <body>I had made a small parser to replace Htmlparser for our program. I would like to replace back Htmlparser in future. However, I am not so hurry on this now. You said I am not clear what you mean "couldn't find issues". Do you mean that you cannot run my program to find the problem? or you can run my program and find the problem but couldn't locate the issue in the htmlparser code? On the other hand, I don't know much about the architecture of htmlparser. It is much easier for me to write my own parser. So is there someone who can show me more about htmlparser first? By the way, in addition to the issue "missing text", I also found that htmlparser changes the links. Here is an example: if you run my code, you will see linkString= http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Canada/Provinces_and_Territories/British_Columbia/Regional_Districts/Cities textString= However, the link in html is Cities/ So it represents http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Canada/Provinces_and_Territories/British_Columbia/Regional_Districts/Skeena_Queen_Charlotte/Cities/ Xue-Feng http://shopping.yahoo.com ------------------------------------------------------- http://thinkgeek.com/sf https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/htmlparser-user ______________________________________________________________________ Post your free ad now! http://personals.yahoo.ca</body>

    <body>Hi Xue, --- Xue-Feng Yang &amp;lt;just4look@...&amp;gt; wrote: Sorry about that. I am personally of the opinion that if a simple text search program works - you should use it instead of the parser. Go for the parser only when you will really get business value out of it. Neither, but close to the latter. I meant I couldn't see any problem in the parser. Only if I see a problem can I proceed to fix it. I wasn't asking you to delve into the code. Its hard, and a little crazy.. I was asking you to write a failing test that involves "using" the parser to do what you want, and assert that it does it correctly. Are you familiar with JUnit? The best way to get familiar with the parser is to look at the docs. Read http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php/TestDrivenDevelopment - writing unit tests is really easy - you should be able to get started here. linkString= http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Canada/Provinces_and_Territories/British_Columbia/Regional_Districts/Cities http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Canada/Provinces_and_Territories/British_Columbia/Regional_Districts/Skeena_Queen_Charlotte/Cities/ If you click on the link above, you will find that it is correct. The parser does append a prefix to each link - the url from which it was picked up. If you have a requirement that does not want the prefix to be added, then that is a functionality change, and needs to be requested as a feature.

Just so you know, there were a couple of links which had images and no text. When I saw those, I thought it was correct behavior not to return any text (and it is). I didn't have the patience to try each and every link- the erroneous link is embedded some way in the output. Sorry about that. You did mention the the link in question- Cities. The bug seems to be : Given a link tag like: the text "Cities" is not returned. Unfortunately, I am away from my coding PC for a while, or I would have written a junit failing test and sent it to the developers. The reason I suggested you write a test is explained in the article I sent earlier. Bug reporting is hardly technical - it is about communication. And precise communication is hard when two people have different contexts (which they always do). The fault is mine for not taking the time to try your report thoroughly, but with a junit test, no explanation (and frustration on your end) would have been necessary. Of course, you need not buy into what I'm saying, and thats fine. Thanks for reporting the bug. Regards, Somik __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? The New Yahoo!

    <body>Xue-Feng, The URL 'error' you mention is actually just the way the Java URL class works. Without a terminating slash, the document base URL is assumed to be a resource, which is correctly removed by the algorithm. Here's an example: public class UrlProblem public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException docbase = new URL (" http://cbc.ca/business docbase = new URL (" http://cbc.ca/business/ // output: // http://cbc.ca/quotes.html // http://cbc.ca/business/quotes.html This is why most URL's that reference the default document (usually index.html), end in a slash.

    <body>Thanks for your comment. You must have some typo there since I cannot see how you get the different outputs with the same code. However, I can guess what you mean(?). If I understand correctly, at least in both IE and Netscape, we have docbase plus http://cbc.ca/business/quotes.html http://cbc.ca/quotes.html So it is not necessary to make such methods as you mentioned. All should be determined in the implementation, and users don't have to worry about. Seem to me is that the problem I met in htmlparser is not this problem. It is more complicated. Let me specify the problem a bit more here: Let docbase=" http://cbc.ca/business1/business2/.../businessn/ ". If n is big, then in htmlparser it has docbase plus http://cbc.ca/business1/business2/.../business(n-1)/quotes.html The "/businessn" is missing. However, for small n, the parser works properly. This is very strang. I believe that it is a bug.

    <body>Xue-Feng, They may resolve to the same document in any browser, but the server is performing the conversion, usually by adding index.html, even if it doesn't indicate it. Try this little experiment: Type http://www.cbc.ca/index.html into your browser.  It works. Why? because the server converts both http://www.cbc.ca and http://www.cbc.ca/ into the same reference, namely http://www.cbc.ca/index.html which it then sends to your browser.  If you think it would accept anything, try typing http://www.cbc.ca/bogus.html - it won't work. Now type http://www.cbc.ca/business/index.html into your browser.  It doesn't work.  Why? Because the http://www.cbc.ca/business or http://www.cbc.ca/business/ does not get converted into that, but instead reference an unknown page, maybe even a jsp page or whatever. On the client side, we cannot know that http://www.cbc.ca/business really refers to http://www.cbc.ca/business/local_cbc_portal.jsp or whatever.   It must be assumed that the last element, unless it ends with a slash, is the file name and hence it must be removed to resolve relative references. This is the correct behaviour.  It is not a bug.

    <body>I actually didn't argue that the directory should be with "/" or not.  In my own code, I only use the one with "/" too. It looks you changed the topic. My point is htmlparser returning a bad link(cite from one of my message): Let docbase=" http://cbc.ca/business1/business2/.../businessn/ ". If n is big, then in htmlparser it has docbase plus http://cbc.ca/business1/business2/.../business(n-1)/quotes.html The "/businessn" is missing. However, for small n, the parser works properly. The example is When you search links on the page http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Canada/Provinces_and_Territories/British_Columbia/Regional_Districts/Skeena_Queen_Charlotte It return "/Cities" to http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Canada/Provinces_and_Territories/British_Columbia/Regional_Districts/Cities This is not coorect, and the correct link should be http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Canada/Provinces_and_Territories/British_Columbia/Regional_Districts/Skeena_Queen_Charlotte/Cities or http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Canada/Provinces_and_Territories/British_Columbia/Regional_Districts/Skeena_Queen_Charlotte/Cities/ However, the htmlparser misses "/Skeena_Queen_Charlotte". It is not because of the reason you stated in your message.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Lower Case vs. Upper Case tags / attributes</header>
    <date>Fri Sep 26 15:18:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>I have noticed that the output from the parser when you use the toHtml() method changes all of the tags / attributes keys to upper case.  I have not seen in the java docs any way to get the output to either keep the original case or to change all to lower case.  My under standing is the xhtml requires all of the tags to be in lower case.  Are there any plans for adding an option to the parser / tags to change the case of the tags to lower case?  Or is there a way to do this that I am just not seeing? Thanks</body>

    <body>The default behavior is implemented in AttributeParser (if I'm not mistaken). This parser aims at allowing you to parse dirty html quick and fast. Not intended as an html cleaner, or xhtml producer. However, if lower case attribute names help you - then it could be a feature request. The only big work is the modification of all tests that break (which is not much). Would you be willing to volunteer?

    <body>Yep. This project is definitely heading in a nice direction for this sort of thing. The 'tidy' program barfs [excuse my French] a bit to easily for my liking. You will find yourself re-implementing the HTML DTD, with lots of exceptions to clean up where the source HTML is broken. Um, also check out Compaq WebL, which despite the 1999 finish date is very good at handling broken HTML wisely. http://research.compaq.com/SRC/WebL . It requires JRE 1.1, to work. Its based on Pascal/Modula 2, but it has powerful manipulation constructs.

    <body>Juris, [this is a repeat of a previous message titled "Traversing the tree multiple times"] Could you gather all the top level nodes into a NodeList once, and then run your extracts against that? The code in Parser to do the extraction is pretty simple: public Node [] extractAllNodesThatAre(Class nodeType) throws ParserException for (NodeIterator e = elements(); e.hasMoreNodes();) so your code would be: public Node [] extractAllNodesThatAre(NodeList topLevel, Class nodeType) for (NodeIterator e = topLevel.elements(); e.hasMoreNodes();) Derrick Juris Zubkans wrote:</body>

    <body>Hi Navid, There is code in the Parser class to detect charset directives, both in the HTTP response header and the HTML content itself. Sometimes they disagree. It then backs up and retraces the file with the new charset. If the page comes from a file it assumes ISO-8859-1 until it encounters the meta tag. If this isn't working can you file a bug with the failing page. Is there feedback saying 'detected charset "XXX", using "YYY"'? Derrick Navid H.Langaroudi wrote:</body>

    <date>Fri Sep 05 15:49:00 CEST 2003</date>
    <body>I am using the HTMLParser to extract the display text portion of a website so it can be indexed and stored in a database for our search engine. The parser works fine but each line of text that wraps needs to have a space included, otherwise it shows as one large word. For example: My text goes here and since the sentence is rather long it will wrap. When I extract the text I get: My text goes here and since the sentence is rather longit will wrap. I need to get the space between long and it. Below is the code snippet I'm using to parse the text: String url =3D " http://127.0.0.1/ ... pageText =3D Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    <body>Tom, The StringExtractingVisitor is very simplistic and does no whitespace collapsing or text flow break processing. So not only will it jam all the strings together higgledy-piggledy, but there won't be newlines where there should be and possibly lots of extra space where there shouldn't be.  I pefer the StringBean to get text, probably because I wrote it ;). java -classpath htmlparser.jar org.htmlparser.beans.StringBean example.html My text goes here and since the sentence is rather long it will wrap. or java -classpath htmlparser.jar org.htmlparser.parserapplications.StringExtractor example.html My text goes here and since the sentence is rather long it will wrap. See the mainline in either of those classes for ideas. Derrick Tom E. Cole wrote: http://127.0.0.1/ http://www.lamatek.com</body>

    <body>vihang, The constructor you mention tries first as a URL and then if that fails it tries as a file on the local disk, so new Parser ("d:\\myfile.html", new DefaultParserFeedback()) will work.

    <body>I'm guessing here, but... You might be able to send the contents of the script tag through another parser, looking for image tags. You can subclass NodeVisitor and override the visitTag() method to look for script tags, visitAllNodesWith(yourclass). When you find one, you can get it's contents and extract all image nodes from that. Derrick 黃文傑 wrote: http://urlIWantToParse.com</body>

    <body>Hi there My names is Ayhan. I have to thank you first for this fantastic product. I have been trying to write a searchengine for turkish sites only and i needed a robot and htmlparser. And your product-htmlparser solved all my problems. However I have a simple problem: I modified your robot.java class and it works fine. My problem is extracting the strippedtext from the page. I wrote my own visitor by extending NodeVisitor. But the text i can collect is full of javascript. I dont want to collect the javascript and the other things. I want to collect the clean text as you can you collect with( TextExtractingVisitor visitor = new TextExtractingVisitor();). If I create a new parser after my own visitor I can get the clean text (which i need) TurkishLinkVisitor1 visitor = new extract the text because it is a turkish page TextExtractingVisitor visitorx = new System.out.println(ParserUtils.removeEscapeCharacters( So my question : Is there a way of extracting the clean text in my own visitor rather then first visiting all the nodes with my own visitor (deciding if the page is turkish and extracting the links) and creating another parser for text extraction. IF there there is can somebody post an example code please.

If this is done on a pass through the nodes with the iterator, it would be something lile: while (iterator.hasMoreNodes ()) if (node instanceof Tag &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node.getTagName ().equals ("WML")) do if (!(node instanceof EndTag &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node.getTagName().equals ("WML")) else else Then you would use your node list to do whatever you want.

    <body>Hi all, I'm new to htmlparser but I appreciated it very much. I'm coming from JTidy and I definitively decided to change for = htmlparser. Now I've a problem... I'm using htmlparser 1.4 (htmlparser1_4_20031109.zip) I have a script tag like this in a page I'm parsing: // comment with a quote ' I registered a ScriptScanner because I'm interested in avoiding script = text (I'm using htmlparser for text extraction). I didn't use Parser.registerScanners() or any other scanner. When I parse a page with the script tag as before and the ScriptScanner = is registered, the parser stops in corrispondence of the script tag = containing the commented single quote. No more processing is made and no = more text is extracted from the document. I noticed the same behavior = with a single "double-quote". All comes back to normality if I double the single or the double quote = (from ' to '' or from " to "") or I avoid to register the=20 ScriptScanner. In my opinion, it is like the ScriptScanner ignores the script comments = (//) and therefore processes the quotes as a script's "uncommented" = element. When it founds the opening quote and not the closing one it = stops processing nodes in the page. For example this tag let the page be parsed correctly (2 single-quotes = instead of one of the first example): // comment with a quote '' This problem doesn't appear if i don't register a ScriptParser. Someone noticed this strange behavior? can someone help me? If needed I can also send the small code that shows the problem and the = small HTML page I used for testing (very few lines). I will appreciate any help (and sorry for my bad english!) Regards, Andrea</body>

    <date>Fri Nov 28 02:05:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Andrea, The difference between the script scanner and regular scanner is that it tries to balance quotes. That is, for script like: it is supposed to ignore the &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; tag within quotes, yet honour the one outside of the quotes. You've run into the case where a single quote is within a comment, but no corresponding end quote exists. At this point the script scanner isn't cognizant of comments, so it assumes the quoted text extends to the end of input. Handling this case could be added, but it would require an augmented or different state machine. We would like to encourage you to write a scanner that can handle these cases (and while you are at it can you write a JSP scanner too?). Until then, if you don't register the script scanner, you should be able to avoid the script text by ignoring elements between the start and end script tag, as long as you don't run into an example like the above.

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] Adding spaces after tags with TextExtractingVisitor</header>
    <date>Wed Nov 05 14:08:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>I'm using HtmlParser to turn HTML documents into plain text versions for use with Lucene. My current method is to use TextExtractingVisitor to produce the text version. However, it oftens produces files without sufficient breaks between text, and so you can end up with words being run together My simple solution (patch attached) was to allow you to tell TextExtractingVisitor to add spaces for you, after handling non blank node texts. It does sometimes add extra spaces, but that seems to be better than not adding enough! Is this the right place to attack this problem, or should I be putting space adding code somewhere else? On a different note - has anyone been able to build HtmlParser with Ant 1.5.4? When I try, it breaks, with the last few lines produced: [echo] Replacing version VERSION_DATE = "Oct 26, 2003" with VERSION_DATE = "Nov 05, 2003" in src/org/htmlparser/Parser.java [echo] Replacing version "1.4 (Integration Build Oct 26, 2003)" with "1.4 (Integration Build Nov 05, 2003)" in docs/release.txt [echo] Replacing version tag 1_4_20031026 with 1_4_20031105 in all source files BUILD FAILED file:/usr/local/Java/htmlparser1_4/build.xml:170: IOException in /usr/local/Java/htmlparser1_4/src/org/htmlparser/tests/nodeDecoratorTests/DecodingNodeTest.java - sun.io.MalformedInputException:null Anyone know the solution?

    <body>For better line breaks, try the org.htmlparser.beans.StringBean, it produces text with breaks where most browsers place them, by checking breaksFlow(): java -classpath htmlparser.jar org.htmlparser.beans.StringBean http://whatever_url It's likely the problem with DecodingNodeTest is only the first of a few, having to do with non-ascii characters in the file. I recently fixed this in the CVS trunk, but if you wanted to fix the source you have, run the offending file(s) through native2ascii, which is a utility that comes with the JDK to convert native characters to unicode. I'm not sure how to do it in Windows, but in unix land you set your LANG environment variable to us_EN and run native2ascii DecodingNodeTest.java &amp;gt; temp.txt mv temp.txt DecodingNodeTest.java If you can't get that to work, edit the file(s) manually to remove the division signs and replace them with \u00f7.

If you do call it externally, it barfs with a null pointer, since mBuffer is unset. I think the solution will be to move some of the duplicated init code from extractStrings() and setStrings() into the constructor, and add a new boolean for "has undergone some parsing", which can be the internal check for needing to do the parsing itself. I'll email the patch once I get something sane working native2ascii -reverse did the trick, thanks Nick</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] registerScanners going bye bye</header>
    <date>Wed Nov 12 03:08:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Two questions for users and developers... As part of the refactoring going on, the scanners are being obviated. This means that except for the TagScanner, CompositeTagScanner and ScriptScanner, the scanners package will be empty. Instead of registering scanners, programmers will register tags. These will be cloned as needed to be returned as parsed nodes. I'm in a position now to remove the registerScanners() method, and I'm wondering if the state of a new Parser shouldn't be preloaded with tags it recognizes. This is directly opposite to the current implementation where one needs to do a two phase setup: I've looked at all the code I have available, and in every case (except for unit test cases) the new Parser call is immediately followed by registerScanners. Question: Should a new parser be already configured and ready to rock with tags registered? Of course there will be ways to get the original behaviour. After much discussion with Joshua, I've broken out the NodeFactory as a class, so currently this might look like (my unsubmitted codebase): where the boolean indicates the node factory should be constructed empty. Of course, you can add (or remove) whatever specific tags (even your own custom ones) you want to receive: which could also be written: An empty node factory generates undifferentiated tag, string and remark nodes, just like the Lexer. Then - I need to know how far I should go. Question: Should the node factory, and hence the Parser, have *all* the possible tags it knows about registered by default? This would be the equivalent of the current registerDomScanners() method call, which adds &amp;lt;HTML&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt; recognition. This may be slightly more problematical, since I can find very few (none?) instances of it's use. Realistically, if your program isn't handling recursing into node children now, you are probably doing it wrong, and adding one more level to the node tree won't cause a problem. My preference is to load it up completely, as it makes for a cleaner design, but if somebody can provide a compelling reason not to, I'll listen. In the absence of responses, I will take the answers as an emphatical Yes and Yes. Derrick</body>

    <date>Thu Nov 06 05:54:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hi all: I want to design a program to parse all links , all image links and all meta tags.I parse all links first , then parse image links and finally parse meta tags.However , when I completet parse all links , I can't parse image links and meta tags successfully. I guess I must reset Parser or reset NodeReader (coz I use NodeReader to intialize Parser) . How can I do that??? Thanks in advance</body>

It's unclear how you are 'printing' the node.

    <body>You have used methods that *extract* information from the URL. This is a different use-case from *transforming* the html, which is what you seem to want. I would suggest looking into UrlModifyingVisitor. You can modify and recompile it it to alter image and link tags differently, but by default it changes both the same way.

    <date>Fri Dec 05 22:53:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>I'm new to Htmlparser, and the lack of adequate documentation is giving me fits.  In my application I need to extract the title and content (minus tags) of the document.  I found, however, that no TitleTag nodes are ever produced.  It looks like I may have to register a TitleScanner.  This leads me to two questions: 1. I can't find a good description anywhere of what, exactly, scanners do. 2. The ctor for TitleScanner takes a string argument described as the "filter". What in the world is a filter?  Nowhere is this described in sufficient detail that I can figure out what string I should pass to the ctor (and why).  Looking through the code, I see places where the TitleScanner ctor is passed "-t", "-T", and "", but I have no clue as to what differences these produce.</body>

    <header>Re: [Htmlparser-user] Scanners and filters</header>
    <date>Sat Dec 06 00:54:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Kevin, Scanners are responsible for turning generic nodes into specific nodes (at least in the version you've got they do). The really useful ones (script scanner, jsp scanner come to mind) sort of take over the low level character by character reading of the URL to determine the extent of a tag. If you call parser.registerScanners() it will register the title tag and nearly all the other scanners too. This means that the specific TitleTag will be produced rather than just a generic Tag. You can register just the title scanner and you can give anything for a filter. It (was) used in the main line program to extract tags based on command line switches that matched, but that doesn't work very well since it doesn't dig recursively into the structure. That will go away in the next release. For extracting text content look at the StringBean. It won't do the title, but it does a fairly nifty job on the text. For a demo try: java -jar htmlparser.jar org.htmlparser.beans.BeanyBaby Hope this helps. Kevin S. Van Horn wrote:</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] inside inverted comma</header>
    <date>Thu Dec 04 17:40:00 CET 2003</date>
    <body>Hi Somik and all, I hope all of you are doing well. I have this small problem, I guess because I did not worked on htmlparser in a long time, I forgot many things. Anyway, I am trying to read this page, but because a javascript code that is in body of page, parser gives me an error, "incontered inside inverted comma" I am not interested of reading javascript code, I want to skip whatever is inside &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;. How can I do that. When I use registerScanners, I get even more errors. Any suggestion? Thanks Navid __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

    <body>I am currently using Version 1.3 and have a thread problem. In summary, I have a list of URLs (approximately 800 at a time) and I start a fixed number of threads to parse those pages. On occasion, a thread never completes and the log file logs "I/O Exception occurred while reading!" until I stop Tomcat. It does not happen often (maybe once every few thousand pages...) and I have not been able to reproduce the error in a test environment. Is this an issue that you have come across before? If so, do you have any advice on addressing the issue? Thank you in advance for your assistance. Steve</body>

    <body>Yorgos, 1) You might not need the source files. Perhaps just add the htmlparser.jar to the list of 'jars', 'libraries', 'archives'  or whatever JBuilder calls jar files. 2) If you do need the htmlparser source files, I don't think you should put them in "C:\JBuilder9\jdk1.4\" in any case. Did you make a project? Where do those files wind up? 3) Use org.htmlparser.XXXX in your imports. This should reflect the directory heirarchy exactly.

I have written a visitor and my visitor has a method titletag.getTitle() returns the title if tag is uppercase &amp;lt;TITLE&amp;gt; if not..i can not get the title..( i can see the html page they have &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;) is there an easy way of removing them from getStrings() method of StringBean? thank you very much in advance Ayhan --------------------------------- Yahoo!

    <body>Derrick, Thanks for the quick response I think i know where the problem is: I set my linux to turkish locale. In turkish there are two 'i's one with dot on it and one without a dot. so TITLE IN TURKISH DOES NOT EQUAL TITLE IN ENGLISH. TitleScanner was returning false when "title".toUppercase().equals("TITLE").. I set the default locale at the begining of the thread to english..It solved the problem..However I need turkish locale for the text (for database) Is there a way i can get the title fields without setting the default locale to english?

    <body>Ayhan, First off, you should probably switch to the 1.4 version, since much has changed since 1.3. You should be able to use any locale when running the parser, if not I'll try to fix it. It's likely that the page with the Turkish title should have used : (or whatever lang name it is), or the title tag should follow the META tag that sets the character encoding.

    <body>Ayhan, I think it's a good idea for the parser to always use an english Locale when converting to upper case for tag names and attribute names. Thanks for pointing that overload out. I've identified about a dozen places where the String.toUppercase() is performed that should use a locale. I will implement this when the CVS system comes back online. You can track this with bug #883664 toUpperCase on tag names and attributes depends on locale. I'm surprised though, that your experiment didn't also find the end tag, which uses the same mechanism. Can you provide a URL that would illustrate the problem. My suspicion is the title tags are (incorrectly) built with Turkish characters. Perhaps you need to overload the TitleTag to recognize various combinations of English and Turkish characters, i.e. Title, TITLE, T\u0130TLE and T\u0131tle. These would convert to uppercase differently, based on the locale used. So you might define: public class TurkishTitleTag extends TitleTag /** * The set of names handled by this tag. */ /** * The set of tag names that indicate the end of this tag. */ /** * Return the set of names handled by this tag. * @return The names to be matched that create tags of this type. */ public String[] getIds () /** * Return the set of tag names that cause this tag to finish. * @return The names of following tags that stop further scanning. */ public String[] getEnders () Then you would substitute this tag for the normal TitleTag using something like: That should find all combinations of title, even without the toUppercase(locale) change, unless, of course, there are other special Turkish characters that need to be handled. Derrick p.s. Can you also provide a URL for the style problem. Ayhan Peker wrote: http://www.metu.edu.tr/about/admins.php</body>

    <body>Hi all, Recently, I've migrated some from nekohtml to htmlparser and found some little problem with the size of the tags/nodes htmlparser can parse. Htmlparse throws the following StackOverFlowError java.lang.StackOverflowError at org.htmlparser.filters.NodeClassFilter.accept(NodeClassFilter.java:57) at org.htmlparser.AbstractNode.collectInto(AbstractNode.java:145) at org.htmlparser.tags.CompositeTag.collectInto(CompositeTag.java:325) at org.htmlparser.tags.CompositeTag.collectInto(CompositeTag.java:329) at org.htmlparser.tags.CompositeTag.collectInto(CompositeTag.java:329) at org.htmlparser.tags.CompositeTag.collectInto(CompositeTag.java:329) . . . when parses pages containing some large tag (in my case a very long piece of javascript). It looks like the stack cannot hold so many recursions... Does anybody know how I could deal with the problem? Right know I simply catch the error and must stop parsing these pages. Thanks, Xavi.</body>

    <body>Xavier, Interesting problem... First, I presume you are using the 1.4-20040104 version, which had a fix for incorrectly nested tags that caused a stack overflow. The stack trace looks like it's from a recent build, and would agree with a deeply nested tag, rather than that issue (but just checking). Second, I assume your platform is Windows, which has consistently shown this type of problem, so maybe switch to linux. (grin) Third, you are probably running the java command with no parameters, you might try increasing the stack space with -Xss256k or more. If it's an old version of the JVM (i.e. 1.2) this is probably more important. Perhaps upgrade your JVM. Fourth, if you post a bug, be sure to add one or more URLs that fail, so it can be reproduced. Fifth, I haven't tried this but it should be possible to change the JSP scanner to be the ScriptScanner, which flattens the tag out completely to contain a single StringNode. Something like this should work: Parser parser = new Parser (" http://urlIWantToParse.com If that works for you, I'll make it so in the next release. Derrick Xavier Guardiola wrote:</body>

    <body>Xavier, puzzle scene, I've found out where the  problem lies. It's in the toString() method of CompositeTag when encountering tags of the form &amp;lt;td width="69"/&amp;gt;. In this case the end tag is 'this' tag which wasn't handled by the output code. I'll drop a fix and build a new release after the CVS services come back online. Since that's late tonight, my time, it will probably be tomorrow. In the meantime, if you can compile your own HTML parser, change line 486 of org/htmlparser/tags/CompositeTag.java from: if (null != getEndTag ()) to: if ((null != getEndTag ()) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (this != getEndTag ())) // 2nd Derrick Derrick Oswald wrote:</body>

    <body>Wain, The http://www.china-pub.com/computers/common/info.asp?id=16306 page has Chinese characters before the &amp;lt;META&amp;gt; tag that tells the parser to switch to the gb2312 (x-EUC-CN) character set: When it hits the &amp;lt;META&amp;gt; tag the parser retraces the bytes it's read so far using the new encoding comparing the characters under the two encodings, and discovers that some characters that it has already returned to the user are bogus because they were interpreted wrongly by the ISO-8859-1 encoding. The parser throws an exception to indicate that something bad happened, and the simplistic handling in the StringBean just passes it along instead of retrying with the correct character set. There are three things conspiring to make this problem: 1) The http://www.china-pub.com server is misconfigured and is serving Chinese pages without specifying the correct character encoding in the HTTP header. 2) The page has the &amp;lt;TITLE&amp;gt; tag containing Chinese characters before the were switched it wouldn't present a problem. 3) Poor error handling in the StringBean that doesn't recover gracefully from such problems. I'll see what I can do about the latter. This has been entered as bug #874175 StringBean doesn't handle charset change wel http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;amp;aid=874175&amp;amp;group_id=24399&amp;amp;atid=381399 Derrick wain wen wrote: http://www.china-pub.com/computers/common/info.asp?id=16306 http://shopping.263.net/eshop/details.asp?gid=84983 http://go5net.com/goods/goods.asp?wid=47518 http://www.china-pub.com/computers/common/info.asp?id=16306 , in</body>

    <body>Steve, I think you've hit on the nub of the difference between the lexer and the parser. The lexer simply returns nodes, in order, and doesn't try to match end tags with start tags. So yes, you will get a TitleTag, but it hasn't been fed it's children. The parser on the other hand will cause collection of the nodes between start and end tags so as to "know" that the thing between the TITLE and /TITLE tag is the "title of the document". See the home page for another explanation: http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/ What you can do with the Lexer is get the next node *after* the TITLE tag and assume it's a plain text title in a string node (people do funny and stuff like that, which I'm not sure is even completely handled by the parser code, so you have to be careful). Or perhaps get the *next* StringNode from the lexer which is presumably the title for the same reasons as outline before, but you have to watch out for empty the 'right thing'.  If it doesn't, let us know. Derrick Steve McCann wrote:</body>

    <header>[Htmlparser-user] RemarkNodes are "invisible" to Parser and NodeVisitor</header>
    <date>Wed Feb 18 17:18:00 CET 2004</date>
    <body>Hello, This should be very trivial to do, but I've tried all the ways presented on the HTMLParser wiki and I just can't seem to retrieve the comments in the webpages I parse. I've tried it by inheriting NodeVisitor and redefining the visitRemarkNode(RemarkNode) method, and then of course sending the message visitAllNodesWith(MyVisitor) to the parser but there's no result (checked by trying to output a test string in visitRemarkNode). I've played around with RemarkNode.accept(MyVisitor), but it was no use - and I don't think I inherited it in a bad way since I used your documentation and the tags are visited correctly by visitTag. What puzzles me most though is that when I've tried it the other way - not using a visitor - and displayed the result of : System.out.println(n.getClass()); // (1) System.out.println("htmlBuffer contains:\n"+htmlBuffer.toString()); // (2) ... the output of (1) doesn't contain any reference to a RemarkNode (there are references to StringNode though, and I've unsuccessfully used accept(MyVisitor) on them), but the output of (2) does contain the commented part. I've spent hours in the documentation, the code and on the net looking for help, but didn't find anything (nor anyone) that could solve my problem. I hope someone here will have the will and time to help me. Thanks everyone and have a nice day, A.</body>

    <body>Anthony, I just tried the following little program, to make sure there wasn't a fundamental flaw: public class RemarkVisitor extends NodeVisitor public void visitRemarkNode (RemarkNode remark) public static void main (String[] args) throws ParserException parser = new Parser (" http://cbc.ca If you run this, it should show something like: ... I'm not sure where you are going wrong. The signature of the method looks correct (upper and lower case do matter). Have you imported the right RemarkNode class? Maybe clip out the visitRemarkNode() method from this message and paste it in your class. The compiler should complain with both of them defined. The reason you can't see RemarkNode objects in your other example is because they are nested within other tags. You would have to use getChildren() to dig into each node, and dig into the children of those and so on recursively. For example, void printAllNodeClasses (Node node) if (null != children) for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; children.size (); i++) Then replace line (1) with: Derrick Anthony Labarre wrote:</body>
